space of elimination orders, possibly throwing out the
most efficient orders from consideration. As an exam­
ple, consider the network in Figure 1, which admits 6

order of width 1 for computing MPE in this case.

Figure 1: A simple network, its possible elimination
orders, the widths, and whether or not each order can
be used for MPE, and MAP(B,C). Requiring that A
be eliminated before B and C forces the width of the
elimination order used for MAP(B,C) to be 2, while
an order of width 1 can be used for MPE.
The complexity of a variable elimination algorithm is
exponential in the (induced) width of the used elimina­
tion order .1 Hence, the increase in such a width when
computing MAP can be critical: it may simply make a
particular network inaccessible to variable elimination
algorithms when computing MAP, even though it is
accessible when computing MPE.
In order to assess the magnitude of increase in width
caused by restricting elimination orders, we gener­
ated 1000 Bayesian networks randomly as given in
Appendix A and then computed the constrained and
unconstrained elimination orders for these networks
using the min-fill heuristic [12, 9). For constrained
orders, all non-MAP variables were eliminated first.
Each network had 100 nodes and the set of MAP vari­
ables consisted of 10-25 root nodes. We measured the
minimum, maximum, average and weighted average
width for the two classes of orders.The average was
computed as 2:�1 wifk. Since the complexity is ex­
ponential in the width, a weighted sum gives a better
representation of the average complexity. It was com­
puted as log2(2:�=1 2w• /k). Figure 2 summarizes the
results.
In many cases, the constrained width was much larger
than the unconstrained width, often making the MAP
problem unreasonably expensive, even when the MPE
problem could be solved exactly with reasonable re­
sources. For example, the weighted average width in1The width of

creased from about 13 to about about 27 due to MAP
constraints. That is, even though the largest table con­
structed by variable elimination has about 214 entries
when computing MPE, the algorithm needs to con­
struct a table with about 228 entries when computing
MAP.
The additional resources needed to solve MAP are not
only a property of variable elimination algorithms, but
are also shared by other algorithms, such as clustering
[13, 10, 9] and conditioning [4]. There is definitely a
gap between our ability to solve MAP and MPE prob-­
lems, which is best witnessed by the lack of support
for MAP algorithms in existing commercial tools for
Bayesian network inference.
In this paper, we propose and investigate a method
for approximating MAP using local search. The lo­
cal search method has a space complexity which is
exponential only in the network treewidth, as is the
complexity of each step in the search process. Our
experimental results show that local search provides
a very good approximation of MAP, while requiring a
small number of search steps. Practically, this means
that the average case complexity of local search is of­
ten exponential only in treewidth as opposed to the
constrained treewidth, making MAP computations as
efficient as other computations.2

Approximating MAP using Local
Search

Given a Bayesian network B which induces a proba­
bility distribution Pr, and given a set of MAP vari­
ables S, the goal of a MAP algorithm is to compute
an instantiations that maximizes Pr(s I e) for some
evidence e.3
Since computing MAP is often intractable, approxima­
tion techniques are needed. A common approximation
technique is to compute an MPE and then project the
result on the MAP variables. That is, if S' is the
complement of variables S U E, we compute an in­
stantiation s,s' that maximizes Pr(s,s' I e) and then
return s. Another approximation is to compute pos­
terior marginals for MAP variables, Pr(S I e), S E S,
and then choose the most likely state s of each vari2The network treewidth is defined as the width of its
best elimination order. The constrained treewidth is de­

fined as the width of its best constrained elimination or­

variables.

noted by upper-case letters (A) and their values by lower­
case letters ( a ) . Sets of variables are denoted by bold-face

able given e. In [7] genetic algoritms were applied
to approximate the best k configurations of the MAP
variables (this problem is known as partial abduction).
We investigate in this paper a different approximation
technique based on local search, which works as fol­
lows:

1. Start from an initial guess s at the solution.
2. Iteratively try to improve the solution by moving
to a better neighbors': Pr(s ' I e) > Pr(s I e), or
equivalently Pr(s', e) > Pr(s,e).
A neighbor of instantiation s is defined as an instanti­
ation which results from changing the value of a single
variable X in s. If the new value of X is x, we will
denote the resulting neighbor by s - X,x. In order
to perform local search efficiently, we need to compute
the scores for all of the neighbors s - X, x efficiently.
That is, we need to compute Pr(s- X, x, e) for each
X E S and each of its values x not in s. If variables
have binary values, we will have I S I neighbors in this
case.
Local search has been proposed as a method for ap­
proximating MPE [11, 14]. For MPE, the MAP vari­
ables S contain all variables which are not in E (the
evidence variables). Therefore, the score of a neighbor,
Pr(s-X,x, e), can be computed easily since s-X, x, e
is a complete instantiation. In fact, given that we have
computed Pr(s,e), the score Pr(s- X, x,e) can be
computed in constant time.4
4

This assumes that none of entries in the CPTs are 0.

Unlike MPE, computing the score of a neighbor,
Pr(s-X,x,e), in MAP requires a global computation
sinces - X,x, e may not be a complete instantiation.
One of the main observations underlying our approach,
however, is that the score Pr(s -X,x,e) can be com­
puted in O(nexp(w)) time and space where n is the
number of network variables and w is the width of a
given elimination order (we can use any elimination
order for this purpose, no need for any constraints).
In fact, we can even do better than this by computing
the scores of all neighbors Pr(s - X,x, e) (that is, for
all X E Sand every value x of X) in O(n exp(w)) time
and space. There are a couple of ways to do this. We
can use a modification of the technique of fast retrac­
tion in jointrees, which requires working with a special
kind of a jointree [2]. An alternative, more direct ap­
proach is to use differential inference [5].
According to this approach, the probability distribu­
tion of a Bayesian network can be represented as a
multivariate polynomial P(J..:rn .. . ), in which we have
a variable Az for each value x of each network vari­
able. Variables Az are called evidence indicators as
we can use them to capture evidence: The probabilIf there are 0 entries in the CPTs, it may take time linear
in the number of network variables to compute the score.
Pr{s, e) is the product of the single entry of each CPT
that is compatible with s, e. When changing the state of
variable X from x to x', the only values in the product that
change are those from the CPTs of X and its children. If
none of the CPT entries are 0, Pr(s- X,x',e) can be
computed by dividing Pr(s, e) by the old and multiplying
by the new entry for the CPTs for X and its children. This
can be done in constant time if the number of children is
bounded by a constant.

As we shall see later, it takes a small num­

Hence, the overall runtime is often O(nexp(w)) too.
Therefore, we can solve MAP in time and space which

the constrained one, which is typically much larger.

of local search methods. Specifically, the probability of

sistent with 8 and >.., = 0 otherwise.) This allows us to
view the computation of MAP as an optimization problem
where we are looking for the values of indicators >.., (in­

One can draw a number of observations based on these
experiments:
•

In each case, taboo search performed slightly bet­
ter than hill climbing with random restarts.

•

The search methods were typically able to per­
form much better than the initialization alone.

•

Even from a random start, the search methods
were able to find the optimal solution in the ma­
jority of the cases.

Overall, taboo search with sequential initializa­

network evaluations.

Table 3 contains some statistics on the number of net­
work evaluations (including those used for initializa­

quite small for all of the methods. Surprisingly, for
the hill climbing methods, the maximum is also quite
small. In fact, after analyzing the results we discov­

over the first peak they discovered. 7 This suggests
that one viable method for quick approximation is to
simply climb to the first peak and return the result.
Taboo search on the other hand was able to improve
on the first peak in some cases.

7It appears that the random walk used in restarting
does not make eventually selecting a better region very
likely when using so few search steps. Often, when a sub
optimal hill was encountered, the optimal hill was just 2 or
3 moves away. In those cases, the taboo search was usually
able to find it (because its search was more guided), while
random walking was not.

Discussion

The primary advantage of approximating MAP us­
ing local search in place of solving it exactly using
structure-based methods is that local search typically
requires much less time and space, yet produces very
good approximations. Given a network with n vari­
ables and an elimination order of width w, local search
requires O(nexp(w)) space. Standard exact algo­
rithms require O(nexp(wc)) space, where We is the
width of a constrained elimination order. Moreover,
the time complexity of local search is O(inexp(w)),
where i is the number of search steps. An exact algo­
rithm on the other, would require O(n exp(wc)) time.
As our experiments have shown, i can be quite small,
while the difference between exp(w) and exp(wc) can
be quite significant. Therefore, many MAP problems
that are intractable for exact methods can be approx­
imated well and efficiently using local search.
Local search methods also have a big advantage over
MPE and ML approximations (the methods typically
used in place of MAP in diagnosis) in that it is much
more accurate. With just a few (in some of our ex­
periments 2-5) network evaluations, one can use ML
or MPE to initialize, and then hill climb to produce a
drastically better MAP solution. If more accuracy is
desired, sequential initialization can be used with hill
climbing or taboo search instead, at a cost of a few
more network evaluations.

Generating Random Networks

We generated several types of networks to perform our
experiments. We used two methods for generating the
structure, and a single parametric method for gener­
ating the quantification.
A.l

Generating the Network Structure

The first method is parameterized by the number of
variables N and the connectivity c. This method tends
to produce structures with widths that are close to c.
See [6J for an algorithmic description.
The second method is parameterized by the number
of variables N, and the probability p of an edge being
present. We generate an ordered list of N variables,
and add an edge between variables X and Y with prob­
ability p. The edges added are directed toward the
variable that appears later in the order.
For the experiment in Figure 2, we used method 1 with
100 and c between 1 and 20.

N

=

For the experiments in Figures 5 and 6, we used
N
100, c between 6 and 12, and p = .025. These
numbers were chosen so that the MAP width would be
small enough that we could compute the exact value
to measure the solution quality.

A.2

Quantifying the Dependencies

The quantification method is parameterized by a bias
parameter b. The values of the CPTs for the roots were
chosen uniformly. The values for the rest of the nodes
were based on a bias, where one of the values v was
chosen uniformly in [0, b), and the other as 1- v. For
example, for b = .1, each non root variable given its
parents has one value in [0, .1), and the other in (.9, 1].
Special cases b = 0, and b .5 produce determistic,
and uniformly random quantifications respectively.
