INTRODUCTION

similar -to some degree- to that of ants in two aspects.
First, in order to increase the coverage of the environment,
the robots have a partially random moving behaviour; and
second, the robots cooperate by transferring each other the
perceived

environment

they

meet.

Sharing

information in this way, allows the host to get the
information not only from the robots that successfully
return after an exploratory run, but also some information
from those that could not return, provided that they had
encountered robots that safely returned. Using this multi­
robot strategy to generate a model of the environment, we
expect to achieve a better efficiency than that which would
be obtained based only on a single expensive robot.
The following section in this paper describes the structure
and the behaviour of the robots. Then, we describe a
statistical error analysis performed in order to know how
the error intervals increase with the covered distance and
the number of turns. This analysis will be used to model

MECHANICAL

CHARACTERISTICS

Each robot is 21 em. length and 15 em. wide (see Fig. 1).
It has three wheels, two of them are 5 em. steering wheels
controlled by independent motors. The robots can reach a
maximum speed up of 0.6 m/sec., and since the battery
has about half hour of autonomy, each robot can do a
maximum exploration of about 1000 m.

P3= robot with "routine" behaviour.
When the robot finds a frontal obstacle, the turn can be
done to the right or to the left based also on a probability
value P4. The robots having a probability P4<0.5 will
show a tendency to turn to the right more often than to
the left, whilst the robots having a probability P4>0.5
will behave inversely.
Consequently, the different robots of the exploration
troupe will not show an identical behaviour. They can
behave in six different ways corresponding to the different
combinations of behaviours and turning tendencies.

- Impulse generators at each wheel for odometry.

The control unit in each robot has been designed having in
mind that the hardware had to be as simple as possible
but, on the other hand, it had to allow achieving a
behaviour sufficiently smart in order to navigate
efficiently. Furthermore the robot had to be based on a
hardware flexible enough to allow for experimentation of
navigation and control strategies. These requirements have
resulted in a design which contains three different
functional modules : the navigation module that generates
the trajectory to be followed; the steering module that
controls the motors in order to follow the generated
trajectory; and the perception mo dule that acquires
information of the environment by means of IR sensors.
The computer used to implement the navigation control
unit is a 80C l86 with a 1MB RAM to store the perceived
environment map. Finally, the steering control module is
implemented on a 80C552 and operates with a resolution
of 2 mm.

SENSING CAPABILITY

Each robot is equipped with the following sensors:

- A proximity sensor for the detection of the terrain
horizontal discontinuities.
- Safety micro switches for the detection of possible
collision.
- One omnidirectional IR Emitter/Receiver sensor to
detect other robots and to transmit data
- One IR Emitter with a scope of 90 degrees to
generate a priority signal (right hand preference)

2.3

CONTROL SYSTEM

NAVIGATION STRATEGY

The navigation system incorporated to each robot has a
partially random behaviour: The robot does a ±45° or

±90° turn either randomly or when it detects an obstacle.
The random turns are done with significantly different
probabilities: PpP 2>P 3 , corresponding to three
differentiated behaviours:
P t =robot with an "Anxious" behaviour
P 2=robot with "normal" behaviour

ERROR ANALYSIS

With the goal of studying the position error of each robot
due to the imprecise odometry and to the imprecise
steering, we have performed an analysis based on
experimental data obtained from the real robots running
straight (10 feet and 20 feet) and also turning 45 degrees
left and 45 degrees right followed by a 10 feet straight run.
We have performed 20 trials of each run and turning
situation for each robot. With the data obtained, we have
used the Kolmogorov normality test to verify that the
experimental sample indeed follows a normal distribution
both in the direction of the trajectory and in the direction
perpendicular to the trajectory and we have tested that both
distributions are independent. Based on this distributions
we have determined the size of an error rectangle,
comprising the 95% of the sample (which is elliptical
shaped), associated to the final position of the robot after a
straight run of I 0 feet. This rectangle is 2.5 inches (in the
direction of the trajectory) x 1 1 inches (in the direction
perpendicular to the trajectory) in the average. We have
also experimentally concluded that the size of the error
rectangle is proportional to the covered distance.
Concerning the additional error due to turning, we have
obtained that when the robots turn 45 degrees there is, in

Incremental map generation

the average, an error of about 2 degrees always towards the
same direction. For example a robot with 2 degrees of
error towards the left turns 43 degrees to the right instead
of 45 degrees and turns about 47 degrees to the left instead
of 45 degrees.

3.1

ERROR PROP�GA TION

In free· space, a trajectory is composed of a set of
alternating segments and turns. Given the error rectangle
at the initial point of a trajectory, we want to determine
the error rectangle at the end of each segment taking into
account the turning error and the error accumulated along
the segment. The next figure shows the error propagation
after a right turn, a straight line, another right turn and
finally another straight line.

the position of the walls detected (and followed) by the
infrared sensors along the tr�ectory path, as well as the
singular points detected, that is the wall ends and the
corners. Due to the unavoidable odometry error, the
position of the detected walls has an associated error. As
we have explained in the last section, we have
experimentally determined this error which has been
approximated by a rectangle centered around the cell
corresponding to the estimated position of the robot as
shown in figure 3.

Figure 2: Error propagation

When following a wall, since the robot remains
practically always at the same distance from the wall, the
error along the direction orthogonal to the wall is taken to
be constant and equal to the error that the robot has after
turning to place itself parallel to the wall once the wall
has been detected. This error analysis and error propagation
study is performed on each robot and is used by the host
to compute the possibility/necessity grid modelling the
environment as described in the next section.

MAP GENERATION

The space being explored by the robots is discretized by
means of a grid. Cells in the grid represent a small area of
the real environment and contain two values : the degree
of possibility and the degree of necessity of the presence
of obstacles. Initially, that is before any exploration has
taken place, all the cells have a possibility value n of I
and a necessity value N of 0. These initial values
correpond to a situation of total ignorance according to the
theory of possibility (Dubois and Prade 1988). As robots
communicate the information gathered during their
exploration, the possibility and necessity values are
modified in a way that depends on the presence, or not, of
obstacles. The information gathered by each robot is
nothing else but the trajectory of the robot together with

When an error rectangle is associated to a position that
belongs to a detected wall, the occupancy certainty degree
(that is the certainty about the presence of an obstacle in
that position) is expressed by means of necessity values in
every cell that results partially or totally covered by the
error rectangle around that position. The necessity values
decrease linearly with the magnitude of the error and
remains positive (N(wall) = lX> 0) in the cells inside the
error rectangle but gets the value 0 at the cells outside the
limits of the rectangle. These values have been established
with the aim of reflecting that, having detected some
obstacle, the necessity that there is a wall cannot be
longer zero but positive since a positive value denotes
some certainty degree about the occupancy of the space.
However this occupancy certainty degree decreases when
the distance to the central cell of the error rectangle
increases. Figure 4 a) shows this case. Notice that the
possibility value is constantly equal to 1 in all the cells
covered by the error rectangle.
As we have already mentioned in the introduction, in our
case Possibility and Necessity values are particular cases
of Belief and Plausibility ones. We can easily see how our
assigned values N(wall)=a>O and J1(wall)=l can be
considered as Belief(wall) and Plausibility(wall)
corresponding to the following basic probability
assignment (b.p.a.):

with mass m:P(.Q) � [0, 11 .
m(0)=0, m(wall)=a, m(wall)=O, m(il)=l-a.
and therefore, we obtain:

This definition implies that their values are unitarily

they reach the zero value. Let errorx be the length of the

COMBINATION OF VALUES

The cell necessity and possibility values representing
trajectories in free space and wall segments are propagated
from a central cell to the cells around as we have seen
above. In considering consecutive points along the
trajectory of the robot or along a wall segment, some of

consequence the new values must be the result of a
combination between these old and new values. In the case

support masses:

of wall segments the values are necessities (increasing
from 0) and are combined by using the max operation
(figure 6 b). In the case of trajectories these values are
possibilities (decreasing from 1) and are combined by
means of the min operator. Figure 6 a) graphically shows
the results of such combination

•

(and m(.O)

On the other hand, we also combine values coming from a
single

wall

segment detection, and since we are

considering non-independent evidences, Dempster's rule is
not suitable for evidence combination. Instead, we have
used a max-combination, a cautious operation whose
results are still under the evidence theory framework.
Indeed, max combination is in accordance with the so­
called 'combination of compatible Belief functions'
(Chateauneuf

1994) that makes sense when interpreting

Bel/Pl values as bounds of the probability measures
consistent with them. Namely, let

F;=12, = {PIB el;(A)� P(A)� Pl;(A)}

be the family of such probabilities (Dempster 1967).
Then, their natural combination can be taken as the
intersection:

F1.2 = Fr 11 F2 =
{Pimax(Be/1 (A), Bel2 (A))� P(A)� min(P/1 (A), Pl2(A))}
