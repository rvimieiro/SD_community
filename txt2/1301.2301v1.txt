the marginals over the Xi in order to determine P(Y),
rather than the full joint over the Xi? It turns out that
sufficiency is equivalent to additive separability of the
conditional probability P(Y I XI, .. . , Xn) into terms
that depend on each of the Xi individually. Separa­
bility is a natural structure, and is closely related to
a form of context-specific independen ce [BFGK96]. It
is quite easy to exploit separability for efficient infer­
ence. There is also a natural generalization to a more
complex notion of conditional separability.
While sufficiency and separability are useful in their
own right for static ENs, what about the original ques­
tion about temporal models? Can we find subsets of
state variables that are self-sufficient, i.e., that the
marginals over these variables at time t are sufficient
to obtain correct marginals over them at time t + 1? It
turns out that some temporal systems can indeed be
hierarchically decomposed into subsystems in a way
that corresponds to separability. As a result, it is
indeed possible to predict the marginal distributions
over the state of a subsystem by propagating marginal
probabilities of the different subsystems.
This is a satisfying result, since it provides a tractable
exact solution of one problem in temporal probabilis­
tic inference. However, this is only a limited success,
because as soon as observations are introduced, prop­
agating marginals is no longer correct, and therefore
the exact monitoring problem is still hard, even for
systems that decompose into separable subsystems.

Sufficiency is a desirable inference property. Suppose
we have a BN containing X, Y and Z as well as other
nodes, and we want to compute P(Z) given some ev­
idence e. Suppose that X and Y are the parents of
Z, and d-separate Z from e, but are not themselves
conditionally independent given e. One way to com­
pute P(Z) is to compute P(XY I e) and then apply .P.
However, if X and Y are sufficient for Z, we can com­
pute P(X I e) and P(Y I e) separately, and apply .Pas
if X andY were independent given e. Is there a rep­
resentational structure corresponding to this inference
property? It turns out that sufficiency is equivalent
to additive separability of the conditional probability
distribution, defined as follows:
Definition 2.2: P(Z I X Y) is separable if there exist
conditional distributions Px(Z I X) and Py(Z I Y),
and-y E [0, 1], such that P(Z I X Y) = rPx(Z I X)+
(1 -{)Py(Z I Y). I
Theorem 2.3: X andY are sufficient for Z iff P(Z I
XY) is separable.

Proof: "If" is easy. If P(Z I XY) is separable,

(1-7) L:11 qy(y)Py(Z I y).

so �(q) depends only on the marginals qx and qy.

Sufficiency and Separability

Let us begin with a simple situation. Consider three
variables X, Y, and Z, with Z depending on X andY
according to the conditional probability distribution
P(Z 1 XY). I will use the notation AXY to denote
the space of probability distributions over XY, and
for q E LlXY, qx denotes the marginal of q over X.
If a joint distribution q over XY is given, P(Z) is
determined by L:zy q(xy)P(Z I xy). Thus the condi­
tional probability of Z given XY determines a function
from A,XY to Az. Normally, this function depends on
the joint distribution q over XY, but in some cases it
is fully determined by the rnarginals qx and qy. This
idea leads to the following definition.

For "only if", assume X and Y are sufficient for Z,
and let Zl be arg maxz(maxz11 P(z I xy) - minz11 P(z I
xy)). I.e., z1 is the value of Z most affected by
XY. Let Xt,Yl be argminzyP(zl I xy), and let
Pt = P(Z I X1Y1). Write a1 = P(Z I XiYt)- P1, and
f3; ::: P(Z I XIY;)- P1. Now, for any i and j, consider
the distributions q1 and q2 where q1 assigns probabil­
ity 1/4 to each of the assignments (xl!YI), (Xt,Yj),
(x.,yi), and (x1,yj), while q2 assigns probability 1/2
to each of (x1, yl) and (xi, Yi). Since q1 and q2 have
the same marginals, by sufficiency �(q1)
.P(q2), so
P(Z I XlYl)+P(Z I XiYj) P(Z I XlYj)+P(Z I XiYI),

Separability has a simple intuitive interpretation. The
dependent variable Z is only influenced by one of its

UAI2001

parents X or Y, but we don't know which. We can
imagine a latent variable that determines which of X
and Y actually influences Z. With probability 1 the
actual parent is X, and with probability 1-1 it is Y.
If a* + j3* < 1 (in the notation of the proof), the
separation of P(Z I XY) is not unique. The remaining
probability mass 1 a* - j3* can be divided in any
way between Px and Py. The choice of 1 == 0,o;_13•
is particularly natural. a* is the maximum possible
effect X can have on Z if Y is held fixed, while {3* is
the maximum effect of Y as X is held fixed, so together
a* and {3* can be viewed as determining the relative
importance of the two parents.

pends only on the marginals of q over the individual
x,. We say that P(Z I xl' ... , Xn) is separable if it
can be written as E, I;P;(Z I X;), where the P, are
conditional distributions and I:; li = 1. Using induc­
tion, and similar ideas to the proof of Theorem 2.3,
one can show that X1, ... , X n are sufficient for Z iff
P(Z I X1, ... ,Xn) is separable.

Comparison to Other Structures

Separability is incomparable to conditional indepen­
dence. X and Y may be conditionally independent
given Z, but not sufficient for Z, and vice versa. How­
ever, if Y is conditionally independent from Z given
X, then trivially X and Y are sufficient for Z.
Separability is closely related to context-specific inde­
pendence (CSI) [BFGK96]. In fact, it can be viewed as
a case of CSI where the context variable is latent. Sep­
arability corresponds to a strong form of CSI, where
only one parent is relevant given the context.
Another framework which superficially has some of the
same properties as separability is that of causal inde­
pendence (HB94], which includes the well-known noisy­
or model. In this framework, one also gets a decompi­
sition of a large conditional probability distribution in
terms of individual dependence on each of the parents.
However, separability and causal independence are not
related; they correspond to two very different ways in
which causes can interact. W ith causal independence,
the different causes are all active simultaneously, but
their actions happen independently. With separabil­
ity, exactly one of the different causes is active, but we
don't know which. Causally independent models do
not have the sufficiency property.
Separability is related to the concept of synergy from

423

the qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) frame­
work [Wel90]. Additive synergy characterizes whether
the different causes of an effect reinforce each other or
interfere with each other. Separable conditional dis­
tributions exhibit zero synergy - the different causes
neither reinforce nor interfere with each other, because
only one of them is actually active. In contrast, the
noisy-or model exhibits negative synergy; if multiple
causes are on, some of their work is wasted because
another cause would have achieved the effect anyway.
2.2

Exploiting Separability in Bayesian
Network Inference

Earlier I described how sufficiency can be used

to sim­
plify particular BN computations. It is in fact possible
to exploit separability in a general way in BN infer­
ence. One idea is to make the latent selection vari­
able explicit, and then use methods that have been
proposed for exploiting CSI. Two methods are pro­
posed in [BFGK96]. One is to condition on the con­
text variable, with the resulting networks being much
simpler. This method is hard to integrate into most
BN implementations, which do not use conditioning.
The second method is based on a network transfor­
mation, which introduces explicit multiplexer nodes
to represent models with CSI. In some cases, this can
produce a simpler network than the original. How­
ever, this transformation is of no benefit in our case,
since the selector variable is essentially already acting
as a multiplexer; the result node after the transforma­
tion will have as many parents as before. Poole and
Zhang [Poo97, ZP99] provide a comprehensive method
for exploiting CSI in inference, based on an extended
version of the variable elimination algorithm that uses
either partial functions or rules. W hile this method
could be used for separability, it requires a significant
extension to standard BN inference methods.

Figure 1: Graph resulting from separability decompo­
sition
As it happens, there is a simple way to exploit separa­
bility within the standard variable elimination or junc­
tion tree inference frameworks. If P(Z I xl, ...,Xn)
is separable, it has the form Ei liPi(Z I Xi)· The
idea is to turn this summation into a sum-of-products
expression, that can then be used in variable elimina­
tion. This is achieved by making the selection vari­
able I explicit, and introducing a factor 9i(I, Z, X;)

Theorem

This decomposition took advantage of the fact that

separability corresponds to a special form of csr in
which there is a single context variable that is used

to determine which parent is relevant. In conjunction
with the transformation from [BFGK96], it can actu­

ally be used as a general method for dealing with CSI
within a standard inference algorithm. The transfor­
mation shows how to transform any tree-structured
conditional probability table into a network with mul­
tiplexers. The transformation presented here can then
be used to replace the multiplexer CPTs with sum-of­
products expressions.

Separability in Temporal Models

Self-Sufficiency

How is all this relevant for temporal probabilistic mod­
els? Let us look at some examples. First, suppose that
there are two state variables xt and yt. Suppose that
in the dynamic model specifying P (X t I xt-l yt-1)
and P(Yt I xt-1 yt-1 ) , xt-1 and yt-1 are sufficient
for xt and also for yt. The DBN structure is shown
in Figure 3. In this dynamic model, the state vari­
ables at any point in time are not independent of each
other. Nevertheless, because of sufficiency, if we want
to know the marginal distributions over xt and yt we
only need the marginals over xt-l and yt-1. And
similarly, the marginals over xt and yt will give us
the marginals over xt+t and yt+l, assuming their are
no observations to condition the distribution at time
t. We can therefore propagate marginals to obtain
correct predictions of the marginal probabilities of the
state variables at any future time point.

Figure 3: A simple DBN
Now, let us increase the number of state variables
to n, but still assume that the individual vari­
ables xi-1, . .. , x�-1 are sufficient for each of the
Xf, ... , X� . The same situation holds - we only need

to propagate marginal distributions over each of the
Xf to obtain correct predictions of marginals. This is
a natural model for a system with a simple information
flow, in which at each point in time each variable only
receives information from one previous variable, but
we don't know which one. We can introduce a matrix
"(, where 'Yij is the probability that the variable that
influences Xf is xr1. I.e., "Yi is the probability distri­
bution over which variable influences X; at a point in
time. Then, associated with each ij, there is a model
P;j (Xf I x;-1) of the particular way in which X; is
influenced by Xj.

This type of model is fairly natural for weather sys­
tems. The state consists of a variable Xi for each lo­
cation i in a grid. The variable representing a location
may actually be compounded from several variables,
such as temperature, pressure and water density. At
each point in time, the weather at a location depends
stochastically on the weather at one of the neighbor­
ing locations at the previous time, but we don't know
which neighbor. Climate modelers talk about "pack­
ets of air" moving about from one location to another.
In this model, 'Yi encodes the distribution over wind
patterns at i, while Pij encodes how a packet of air
tends to change as it moves from j to i.
Let us enrich the model. At any point in time, the
wind patterns at different points in a region are not
independent, but are correlated by the prevailing wind
direction. We can model this by introducing another
state variable wt indicating the prevailing wind di­
rection throughout the entire region at time t. This
variable will then influence the particular wind pat­
tern at each location, i.e., for each w there is a 1l". We
also make wt depend on W1-1. The DBN is shown
in Figure 4. (For convenience, to keep all edges in
the model go from one time slice to the next, I have
made the wind pattern at location i at time t depend
on wt-1 instead of wt.) This DBN actually displays
little of the structure traditionally sought in DBNs,
since each of the Xf variables depends on all of the
other variables at the previous time. Nevertheless, the
seperability makes this a highly structured model, and
the structure can b e exploited.
It no longer holds that individual state variables at
time t -1 are sufficient for the state variables at timet.
However, the doubletons {wt-1, xJ-1} are sufficient
for each Xf. This fact alone is not enough to provide
a prediction method via propagating marginals, be­
cause we need to maintain marginals over {Wt, Xf},
and not just the individual variables. In fact, how­
ever, the sets {wt-t,x;-1} are sufficient for each
{Wt, Xf}. We can see this by checking that for a
given value w of wt-1, pw(W1,Xt I xt-1)
P(Wt I

diction by propagating complete joint distributions is

O(TbM).

4.2

Identifying Self-Sufficient Families

Our goal, then, is to identify self-sufficient families of
sets of state variables, in which the individual subsets
are small. This was possible in the above examples,
but in general it may not be easy to find non-trivial
self-sufficient families (the complete set of state vari­
ables is of course sufficient for itself).

Weather DBN

and therefore P(Wt Xf I xt-1, wt-1) is conditionally
separable given wt-1• As a result, we can propagate
marginals over the pairs (Wt, Xf), to obtain correct
predictions for marginal probabilities over the pairs at
any future time.
l

These examples motivate the definition of a self­
sufficient family of sets of variables. For simplicity
of presentation, I will assume that all state variables
in a DBN depend only on variables from the previous
time slice. Of course, real DBN models may be richer,
including dependencies within a time slice, but this
simplified language captures all we need to develop
the theory.

One might think that a technique based on merging
variables into compound variables would work, as it
did in the weather example. Such a method might be
based on the following rule, which seems plausible: if
X and Y are sufficient both for Z1 and Z2, and Z1 and
Z2 are conditionally independent given XUY, then X
andy are sufficient for z = z1 X z2. Unfortunately,
this is wrong. F igure 5 shows a simple counterexample.
Here, Z 1 and Z2 are deterministic copies of X and
Y respectively. Obviously X and Y are sufficient for
both Z1 and Z2. However they are not sufficient for
zl X z2. The joint distribution over zl and z2 depends
on the joint distribution over X and Y, not on their
marginals.

not clear how useful this rule is in actually identifying

large sets in the family, and normally it will need to

Hierarchical Decomposition

A better approach would be to define ways in which a
complex dynamic system can be hierarchically decom­
posed into separable subsystems, such that the fam­
ily of subsystems is self-sufficient. We can extend the
notion of tree representation defined in Section 3 to
capture a hierarchical system decomposition. Recall
that a tree representation of a family of sets is a tree
containing a leaf for each set. The location of a vari­
able is the lowest node in the tree such that all sets
containing the variable are at or beneath the node. A
complete tree representation is a tree representation

Such a mode of operation is c alled a

Taking over can happen at any level of the hierarchy.

At one extreme, a catastrophic event in one subsystem
can influence all other subsystems. More commonly, a

subsystem will take over the level above it in the hier­
archy, so that it influences the neighboring subsystems.
Figure 6(c) shows an example of a take-over mode in
which the set { 2, 3, 4} has taken over the level above
it in the hierarchy. As a result, variables 1 and 2 now
depend on variable 4, but variable

on its own previous state. The root of the hierarchy,
variable 3, is not taken over, and the operation in the
remainder of the hierarchy is top down.

Suppose that we have a complete tree representation,
and we would like the family of subsystems it repre­
sents to be self-sufficient. In static BNs, we saw that
sufficiency depends on the way information flows from

fect happens in dynamic systems. There may be many
different

modes of operation

in a system, where each

mode is characterized by the actual flow of informa­
tion from variables at the previous time to the current
state variables. At any point in time, the system will
be in a particular mode, but we may not know what
that mode is. In order for self-sufficiency to hold, the
different possible modes of operation must all satisfy
the property that each subsystem depends on the state
of only one subsystem at the previous point in time.

hierarchy could be determined by variables higher up.
For example, the value of variable

could determine

whether the mode is that of Figure 6(b) or Figure 6(c).
Self-sufficiency allows for some quite rich models. On
the other hand, some modes of operation are ruled out
by self-sufficiency. In particular, a subsystem cannot
depend both on its own internal state and on that of
another subsystem at the same time. This rules out
some traditional notions of weak interaction between

subsystems,

in

which the state of a subsystem is almost

completely determined by its own previous state , but
may be perturbed by another subsystem. Separability
corresponds to a very different kind of decomposition,
in which there is a switch determining what influences
a subsystem.

Observations

I have shown how self-sufficient families allow us to
obtain exact predictions of marginals by propagating
marginals.

marginal distributions do not allow us to perform this

All is not lost. If an observed variable appears in
all subsets in a family, then we can correctly condi­
tion in each of th e subsets to obtain correct poste­
rior marginals. If a system has a small number of
observed variables, and we can contrive to place these
variables in the roots of the hierarchical decomposi­
tion while maintaining self-sufficiency, we will be able
to perform exact monitoring of marginals by propa­
gating marginals. Unfortunately I do not expect this
situation to obtain all that often.

Conclusions and Speculations

In this paper, I have analyzed a desirable inference
property - sufficiency - and shown that it is equiv­
alent to a representational structure - separability.
The analysis extends to more complex notions of suffi­
ciency and the corresponding structure of conditional
separability. I have shown how to exploit separabil­
ity and conditional separability within the context of
Bayesian network inference algorithms.
For temporal probabilistic models, I have shown that
some dynamic systems can be decomposed into a self­
sufficient family of subsystems, that allows for exact
prediction of marginal probabilities without propagat­
ing complete joint distributions. This is satisfying,
since as far as I know it is the first non-trivial result
of its kind. At the same time, the fact that it does not
carry over to monitoring is somewhat disappointing.
The results of this investigation were surprising to
me. I began with an intuition that some type of hi­
erarchical decomposition would lead to the ability to
propagate marginals exactly. I expected the struc­
ture to correspond to some sort of traditional notion
of weak interaction, based on local independence or
near-independence of sets of variables. It turned out
that a very different kind of separability structure was
needed, corresponding to simple information flow be­
tween different subsystems. Systems that have little
or no independence, where a variable can depend on
many other variables, may still exhibit separability,
like in the weather model.
As a result, I believe that studying the information
flow in dynamic systems may prove fruitful even when
the system is not completely separable. Can sepa­
rability analysis be integrated with the Boyen-Koller
analysis for monitoring? Can the type of information­
flow decomposition leading to separability be com-

UAI2001

bined with other notions of weak interaction to provide
for near-separability? If so, how can that be exploited
for approximate inference?
Separability may be particularly useful in object-based
models in which relationships between objects may
vary over time. For example, consider a model of a
building and the people in it. At any moment, a per­
son is only in one room, but we may no t know which.
Are there languages that facilitate the definition and
identification of separable models?
Finally, it would be interesting to see if notions of sep­
arability can be useful in decision making frameworks
like factored Markov Decision Processes. Like DBNs,
these have proven resistant to being exploited for ef­
ficient solution. It seems that more structure than a
factored representation is needed to make solving an
MDP tractable. Perhaps separability could provide a
clue to finding such a structure.
