Dean et al. (1993a; 1993b) have proposed a planning
method that relaxes these requirements. An envelope
or subset of states that might be relevant to the plan­
ning problem at hand (e.g., given particll:lar initia: and
_
goal states) is constructed , and an optimal pohcy 1s
computed for this restricted space in an anytime fash­
ion. Clearly, optimality is sacrificed since important
states might lie outside the envelope, as is general­
ity, for the policy makes no mention of these ignored

states. In (Dean et al. 1993b) it is suggested that
domain-specific heuristics will aid in initial envelope
selection and envelope alteration.
We propose an alternative method for dealing with
Markov decision models in a real-time environment.
We suggest that MOPs be explicitly v iewed as search
problems. Real-time constraints can be incorporated
by restricting the search horizon. This is the basic idea
behind for example, Korf's real-time heuristic search
algorithm (1990). In stochastic domains there is an­
other important reason for interleaving execution into
the planning process, namely, to restrict the search
space to the actual outcomes of probabilistic actions.
In particular, once a certain action is deemed best (for
a given state) it should be executed and its outcome
_
observed. Subsequent search for the best next actwn
can proceed from the actual out�ome, ignoring other
_
unrealized outcomes of that actiOn. To further Im­
prove real-time performance, we can cache the best
action for a state once it has been computed and use
the cached value if the agent returns to that state.
·

In general, a fixed-depth search will tend to be greedy,
choosing actions that provide immediate reward at the
expense of long-term gain. To alleviate this problem
we assume a heuristic function that estimates the value
of each state, accounting for future states that might
be reached in addition to that state's immediate re­
ward. This prevents (to some extent) the problem of
globally suboptimal choices due to finite horizo� e!­
.
fects. Knowledge of certain propert1es of the heunst1c
function allow the search tree to be pruned. We de­
scribe one method of constructing heuristic functions
that allows this pruning information to be easily de­
termined. T his construction also produces default ac­
tions for each state, in essence, generating a reactive
policy. Our search procedure �an be viewed as using
deliberation to refine the reactive strategy.
The next section presents the MOP model in detail
and also looks at a more natural representation for de­
scribing worlds and actions. Section 3 describes the al­

gorithm, the interleaving of searc� and e::cecutwn,

of constructing the heuristic evaluation functions, and

The Decision Model

Action

Let S be a finite set of world states. In many do­
mains the states will be the models ( or worlds) asso­
ciated with some logical language, so lSI will be ex­
p onenti al in the number of atoms generating this lan­
guage. Let A be a finite set of actions available to an
agent. An action takes the agent from one world to an­
other, but the result of an action is known only with
some probability. An action may then be viewed as
a mapping from S into probability distributions over
S. We write Pr( s1, a, s2) to denote the probability
that s2 is reached given that action a is performed
in state s1 ( embodying the usual Markov assump­
tion) . We assume that an agent, once it has performed
an act io n , can observe the resulting state; hence the
process is completely observable. Uncertainty in this

model results only from the outcomes of actions be­
ing p robabilis tic , not from uncertainty about the state
of the wo r ld . We assume a real-valued reward func­
tion R, with R(s) denoting the (i mmed iate ) u t ility
of being in state s. For our purposes an MDP con­
sists of S, A, R and the set of transition distributions
{Pr(·, a,·): a E A}.
A control policy 7l' is a function 7l' : S -+ A. If this pol­
icy is adopted , 7r ( s) is the action an agent will perform
whenever it finds itself in state s. Given an MDP, an
agent ought to adopt an optimal policy that maximizes
the expected rewards accumulated as it perfor ms the
specified actions. We concentrate here on discounted
infinite horizon problems: the value of a reward is dis­
counted by some factor f3 (0 < ,B < 1) at each step
in the future; and we want to maximize the expected
accumulated discounted rewards over an infinite time
period. Intuitively, a DTP problem can be viewed as
finding a good ( or optimal ) policy.
The expected value of
state s is specified by

transitions from state to state, we expect that domains
and actions will usually be specified in a more tra­

a stochastic variation of STRIPS rules (Kushmerick,
Hanks and Weld 1993) for a domain i n which the robot

EL1, ... , ELn. If the action is performed in a state
s satisfying D;, then a random effect from EL; is ap­
plied to s. For example, in F igure 1, if the agent carries
out the GetUmbrella acti on in a state where Office i s

true, then with probability 0.9 Umbrella will b e true,
and every other proposition will remain unchanged,
and with probability 0.1 there will be no change of
state. For convenience, we may also w rite actions as
sets of action aspects as illustrated for the Move ac­
tion in Figure 1 ( Bou tilier and Dearden 1994). The
action has two descriptions which represent two inde­
pendent sets of discriminants and the cross product of
the aspects is used to determine the actual effects. For
example, if Rain and Office are true, and a Move action
is performed then with probability 0.81 -.Office, Wet
will result, and so on. Action aspects allow in d epen ­
dence to be rep resented exp licitly , in a similar manner
to causal networks. The representation of domains in
terms of propositions also provides a natural way of
expressing rewards. Figure 2 shows a re presen t ation
of rewards for this domain. The reward for any given
state depends only on the values of the propositions
Has UserCoffee and Wet in that state.
This framework is flexible enough to allow a wide vari­
ety of different reward functions. One important situ­
ation is that in which there is some set 89 � S of go al
states, and the agent tries to reach a goal state in as

few moves as possible.1 Since we are interleaving plan
construction and plan execution, the time required to
plan is significant when measuring success; but as a
first approximation we can represent this type of sit­
uation with the reward function (Dean et al. 1993b):
R(s) = 0 if s E Sg and R(s) -1 otherwise.

The Algorithm

Our algorithm for integrating planning and execution
proceeds by searching for a best action, executing that
action, observing the result of this execution, and it­
erating. The underlying search algorithm constructs a
partial decision tree to determine the best action for
the current state (the root of this tree). We assume
the existence of a heuristic function that estimates the
value of each state (such heuristics are described in
Section 4). The search tree may be pruned if certain
properties of the heuristic function are known. This
search can be terminated when the tree has been ex­
panded to some specified depth, when real-time pres­
sures are brought to bear, or when the best action is
known (e.g., due to complete pruning, or because the
best action has been cached for this state ).
Once the search algorithm selects a best action for the
state, the action is executed and the resulting
state is observed. By observing the new state, we es­
tablish which of the possible action outcomes actually
occurred. W ithout this information, the search for the
best next action would be forced to account for every
possible outcome of the previous action. By interleav­
ing execution and observation with search, we need
only search from the actual resulting state.
In skeletal form, the algorithm is as follows. We denote
by s the current state, and by A*(t) the best action
for state t.2
current

If state s has not been previously visited, build
a partial decision tree of all possible actions and
their outcomes beginning at state s, using some
criteria to decide when to stop expanding the
leaves of the tree. Using the partial tree and
the heuristic function, calculate the best action
A*s
( ) E A to perform in states. (This value may
be cached in casesis revisited.)
2. Execute A* (s).
3. Observe the actual outcome of A*s
( .) Updates
to be this observed state (the state is known with
certainty, given the assumption of complete ob­
servability).
4. Repeat.
1.

1 If a "final" state stops the process, we may use
self-absorbing states or include a null action which does
nothing.
2Initially A•(t) might be undefined for all t. However, if

the heuristic function provides default reactions (see Sec­
tion 4), it is useful to think of these as the best actions
determined by a depth 0 search.

The point at which the algorithm stops depends on the
characteristics of the domain. For example, if there are
goal states, and the agent's task is to reach one, plan­
ning may continue until a goal state is reached, while
in process-oriented domains, the algorithm continues
indefinitely. In our experiments, we have typically run
the algorithm for a constant number of steps. Note
that by caching the best action for each state, the
agent slowly constructs a policy for all the states it
is likely to reach. The use of caching here is similar to
that of Learning RTA search (Korf 1990).
*

3.1

Action Selection

Here we discuss step one of the high-level algorithm
given above. To select the best action for a given
state, the agent needs to estimate the value of per­
forming each action. In order to do this, it builds a
partial decision tree of actions and resulting states,
and uses the tree to approximate the expected utility
of each action. This search technique is related to the
*-minimax algorithm of Ballard (1983). As we shall
see in Section 3.2, there are similarities in the way we
can prune the search tree as well. Figure 3 shows a
partial tree of actions two levels deep. From the initial
state s, if we perform action A, we reach state t with
probability 0.8, and state u with probability 0.2. The
agent expands these states with a second action to pro­
duce the set of second states. To determine the action
to perform in a given state, the agent estimates the
expected utility of each action. If s and t are states,
f3 is the factor by which the reward for future states is
discounted, and V(t) is the heuristic function at state
t, the estimated expected utility of action A; is:
U(A;\s) =

Figure 3 illustrates the process with a discounting fac­
tor of 0.9. The utility of performing action A if the
world were in state tis the weighted sum of the values
of being in states x and y, which is 2.1. Since the util­
ity of action B is 0.3, we select action A as the best
( given our current information) for state t, and make
V(t) = R(t) + /3U(A\t) 2.39. The utility of action A
in states is Pr(sA
, , t)V(t) + Pr(s, A, u)V(u), giving
U(A\s) 2.23. This is lower than U(B\s), so we select
B as the best action for state s, record the fact that
A*s
( ) is B, and execute B. By observing the world,
the agent now knows whether state v or w is the new
state, and can build on its previous tree, expanding
the appropriate branch to two levels and determining
the best action for the new state. Notice that if (say)
v results from action B, the tree rooted at state w can
safely be ignored - the unrealized possibility can have
no further impact on updated expected utility (unless
w is revisited via some path).

A"'(s).

In Figure 3, the tree is expanded to depth two. The
depth can obviously vary depending on the available
time for computation.
The deeper the tree is ex­
panded, the more accurate the estimates of the util­
ities of each action tend to be, and hence the more
confidence we should have that the action selected ap­
proaches optimality. Indeed, it is quite natural to view
the search process as a d irected form of value iteration.
The heuristic serves as the initial value vector, and a
step of the search corresponds to a partial update of
the vector. Convergence results for value iteration can
be adapted to this setting.
If there are m actions, and the number of states that

could result from executing an action is on average b,
then a tree of depth one will require 0( mb) steps, two

levels will require O(m2b2), and so on. The poten­
tially improved performance of a deeper search has to
be weighed against the time required to perform the
search (Russell and Wefald 1991). Rather than expand
to a constant depth, the agent could instead keep ex­
panding the tree until the pro ba bility of reaching the
state being considered drops below a certain thresh­
old. This approach may work well in domains where
there are extreme probabilities or utilities.
3.2

Techniques for Limiting the Search

As it stands, the search algorithm performs in a very
similar way to minimax search. Determining the value

s.

of a state is analogous to the MAX step in minimax,
while calculating the value of an action can be th ought
of as an AVERAGE step, which replaces the MIN step
(see also (Ballard 1983)). W hen the search tree is
constructed, we can use techniques similar to those
of Alpha-Beta search to prune the tree and reduce the
number of states that must be expanded. There are
two applicable pruning techniques. To make our de­
scription clearer, we will treat a single ply of search as
consisting of two steps, MAX in which all the possible
actions from a state are comp ared, and AVERAGE,
where the outcomes of a particular action are com­
bined. Two sorts of cuts can be made in the search
tree. If we know bounds on the maximum and/or
the minimum values of the heuristic function, utility
cuts (much like a and f3 cuts in minimax search) can
be used. If the heuristic function is reasonable, the
maximum and minimum values for any state can be
bounded easily using knowledge of the underlying de­
cision process. In particular, with maximum and min­
imum immediate rewards of .R+ and R-, the maxi­
mum and minimum expected values for any state are
bounded by 1�,13 R+ and 1�,13 R-, respectively. If we
•

•

have bounds on the error associated with the hellristic
function, expectation cuts may be applied. These are
illustrated with examples.

Utility Pruning We can prune the search at an AV­

ERAGE step if we know that no matter what the
value of the remaining outcomes of this action, we
can never exceed the utility of some other action
at the preceding MAX step. For example, con­
sider the search tree in Figure 4(a). We assume
that the maximum value the heuristic function
can take is 10. W hen evaluating action b, since
we know that the value of the subtree rooted at T
is 5, and the best that the subtrees below U and

cannot be larger than 3.5 + 1 + 2 = 6.5 so nei­
ther the tree below U nor that below V is worth
expanding. This type of pruning requires that we
know in advance the maximum value of the heuris­
tic function. The minimum value can be used in
a more restricted fashion. It performs especially
well when nodes are ordered for expansion accord­
ing to their probability of actually occurring.

Expectation Pruning For this type of pruning, we
need to know the maximum error associated with
the heuristic function (see (Boutilier and Dearden
1994) for a way of estimating this value). If we
are at a maximizing step and, even taking into
account the error in the heuristic function, the
action we are investigating cannot be as good as

some other action, then we do not need to ex­
pand this action further. For example, consider
Figure 4(b), where we assume that V(S) is within
±1 of its true optimal) value. We have deter­
mined that U(aiS) = 7, therefore any potentially
better action must have a value greater than 6.
Since p(S, a, T)V(T) +p(S, a, U)V(U):::; 4, even if
b is as good as possible (given these estimates) , it
cannot achieve this threshold, so there is no need
to search further below T and U.

(

Expectation pruning requires a modification of the
search algorithm to check all outcomes of an action
to see if the weighted average of their estimated values
is sufficient to justify continued node expansion. This
means that the heuristic value of sibling nodes must
be checked before expanding a given node, and a tight
bound on V must be found. However, the method of
generating heuristic functions described in (Boutilier
and Dearden 1994) (see the next section for a brief
discussion) produces just such bounds. Expectation
pruning is closely related to what Korf (1990) calls
alpha-pruning. The difference is that while Korf relies
on a property of the heuristic that it is always increas­
ing, we rely on an estimate of the actual error in the
heuristic.

4

Generating Heuristic Functions

We have assumed the existence of a heuristic function
above. We now briefly describe some possible meth­
ods for generating these heuristics. The problem is to
build a heuristic function which estimates the value of
each state as accurately as possible with a minimum
of computation. In some c ases such a heuristic may
already be available. Here we will sketch an approach
for domains with certain characteristics, and suggest
ideas for other domains.

4.1

Abstraction by Ignoring Propositions

In certain domains, actions might be represented as
STRIPS-like rules as in Figure 1, and the reward func­
tion specified in terms of certain propositions. If this is
the case we can build an abstract representation of the
state space by constructing a set n of relevant propo­
sitions, and using it to construct abstract states each
corresponding to all the states which agree on the val­
ues of the propositions in R. A complete description of
our approach, along with theoretical and experimental
results, can be found in (Boutilier and Dearden 1994).
However we will broadly describe the technique here.
To construct 'R, we first construct a set of immediately
relevant propositions IR. These are propositions that
have significant effect on the reward function. For ex­
ample, in Figure 2, both Has UserCoffee and Wet have
an effect on the reward function; but to produce a
small abstract state space, IR might include only Ha­
sUserCoffee, since this is the proposition which has the
greatest effect on the reward function.

R will include all the propositions in IR, but also
any propositions that appear in the discriminant of an
action which allows us to change the truth value of
some proposition in R. Formally, R is the smallest set
such that: 1) IR � R; and 2) if P E R occurs in an
effect list of some action, then all propositions in the
corresponding discriminant are in n.

Integrating Pl ann i ng and Execution in Stochastic Domains

n induces a partition of the state space into sets of

states, or clusters which agree on the truth values of
propositions in 'R. Furthermore, the actions from the
original 'concrete' state space apply directly to these
clusters. This is due to the fact that each action either
maps all the states in a cluster to the same new duster,
or changes the state, but leaves the cluster unchanged.
These two facts allow us to perform policy iteration on
the abstract state space. The algorithm is:
1. Construct the set of relevant propositions 'R. The
actions are left unchanged, but effects on propo­
sitions not in 'R are ignored.
2. Use 'R to partition the state space into clusters.
3. Use the policy iteration algorithm to generate an
abstract policy for the abstract state space. For
details of this algorithm see (Howard 1971; Dean
et al. 1993b)
.

By altering the number of reward-changing proposi­
tions in 'R, we can vary its size, and hence the gran­
ularity and accuracy of the abstract policy. This al­
lows us to investigate the tradeoff between time spent
building the abstract policy and its degree of optimal­
ity. The policy iteration algorithm also computes the
value of each cluster in the abstract space. This value
can be used as a heuristic estimate of the value of
the cluster's constituent states. One advantage of this
approach is that it allows us to accurately determine
bounds on the difference between the heuristic value
for any state, and its value according to an optimal
policy- see (Boutilier and Dearden 1994) for details.
As shown above, this fact is very useful for pruning
the search tree. A second advantage of this method
for generating heuristic values is that it provides de­
fault reactions for each state.
4.2

Other Approaches

The algorithm described above for building the heuris­
tic function is certainly not appropriate in all domains.
Certain domains are more naturally represented by
other means (navigation is one example). In some
cases abstractions of actions and states may already
be available (Tenenberg 1991).
For robot navigation tasks, an obvious method for
clustering states is based on geographic features.
Nearby locations can be clustered together into states
that represent regions of the map, but providing ac­
tions that operate on these regions is more complex.
One approach is to assume some probability distribu­
tion over locations in each region, and build abstract
actions as weighted averages over all locations in the
region of the corresponding concrete action. The diffi­
culty with this approach is that it is computationally
expensive, requiring that every action in every state be
accounted for when constructing the abstract actions.
If abstract actions (possibly macro-operators (Fikes
and Nilsson 1971)) are already available, we need to
find clusters to which the actions apply. In many cases
this may be easy as the abstract actions may treat

167

many states in exactly the same way, hence generat­
ing a clustering scheme. In other domains, a similar
weighted average approach may be needed.

Theoretical and Experimental
Results

We are currently exploring, both theoretically and ex­
perimentally, the tradeoffs involved in the interleaving
of planning and execution in this framework. We can
measure the complexity of the algorithm as presented.
Let m = I .AI be the number of actions. We will assume
that when constructing the search tree for a state, we
explore to depth d, and that the branching factor for
each action (the maximum number of outcomes for the
action in any given state) is at most b.3
The cost of calculating the best action for a single
state is mdbd. The cost per state is slightly less than
this since we can reuse our calculations, but the over­
all complexity is O(md). The actual size of the state
space has no effect on the algorithm; rather it is the
number of states visited in the execution of the plan
that affects the cost. This is clearly domain dependent,
but in most domains should be considerably lower than
the total number of states. Most importantly, the com­
plexity of the algorithm is constant and execution time
(per action) can be bounded for a fixed branching and
search depth. By interleaving execution with search,
the search space can be drastically reduced. W hen
planning for a sequence of n actions the execution algo­
rithm is linear inn (with respect to the factor mdbd); a
straightforward search without execution for the same
number of actions is O(bn).
Experiments in a number of different domains provide
an indication that this framework may be quite valu­
able. To generate the results discussed in this sec­
tion, we used a domain based on the one described in
Figures 1 and 2 but with another item (snack) that
the robot must deliver, and a robot that only carries
one thing at a time. We constructed the heuristic
function using the procedure described in Section 4,
with Has UserCoffee as the only immediately relevant
proposition, ignoring the proposition Has UserSnack;
thus, 'R = {HasUserCoffee, Office, HasRobotCoffee,
HasRobotSnack}.
The domain contains 256 states and six actions. All
timing results were produced on a Sun SPARCsta­
tion 1. Computing an optimal policy by policy it­
eration required 130.86 seconds, while computing a
sixteen state abstract policy (again using policy itera­
tion) for the heuristic function required 0.22 seconds.
F igure 5a. shows the time required to search for the

3We ignore preconditions for actions here, assuming
that an action can be "attempted" in any circumstance.
However, preconditions may play a useful role by captur­
ing user.supplied heuristics that filter out actions in sit­
uations in which they ought not (rather than cannot) be
attempted. This will effectively reduce the branching fac­
tor of the search tree.

best action in a single state, and the expected reward
from the state (•HasRobotCoffee, •HasUserCoffee,
•HasRobotSnack, •HasUserSnack, Rain, •Umbrella,
Office, ...,Wet )4• Time to search grows exponentially
with search depth, while the reward steadily improves
until it reaches its maximum value. As the graph
shows, a close to optimal policy for this particular start
state was found with depth 4 search. As searching to
depth 4 required less than 5 seconds per state, this
is a considerable saving over policy iteration. As the
domain grows in size, deeper search may be necessary
to produce close to optimal behavior, but the time re­
quired for policy iteration typically grows at a faster
rate, so the cost of deeper search is justified.
Figure 5b. and c. show the effects of pruning on the
performance of the algorithm. 5b. shows the percent­
age of states which are searched as search depth in­
creases. Utility pruning performs better than expec­
tation pruning, removing about 20 percent of states
when searching to depth five. 5c. shows the time re­
quired to search. Utility pruning again performs well,
with a 15 to 20 percent saving in execution time.
Although the complexity of performing expectation
pruning results in a slower performance than no prun­
ing at all, in deep search, it may well be worthwhile
to perform expectation pruning close to the root of
the tree where its effect will be the greatest. Value
of computation calculations (1991) might be used to
determine the point at which to stop expectation prun­
ing.
Figure 6 shows a variety of statistics about the pol­
icy induced by various depths of search. There is a
steady improvement in the quality of the policy as
search depth increases, with an almost optimal policy
being discovered at depth 5. Since the value of a state

actions to reach a state with maximal utility; i.e., the state

can range from -15 to 20 in this domain, the errors
made in even relatively shallow search are quite small.
The table also suggests that searching to depth n is at
least as good as searching to depth n - 1 (although it
may not always be better). In none of the domains we
have tested has searching deeper produced a worse pol­
icy, although this may not be the case in general (see
(Pearl 1984) for a proof of this for minimax search).
Figure 7 shows the time required for searching with
and without execution, and with and without caching.
The search-execution model we have investigated per­
forms better than straight search, although, especially
for deep search, the difference is fairly small. This is
due to the small size of the domain and the effects
of caching, which allow the search without execution
algorithm to only search below each state once.

Conclusions

We have proposed a framework for planning in stochas­
tic domains. Further experimental work needs to be
done to demonstrate the utility of this model. In par­
ticular, further comparison to exact methods like pol­
icy iteration and heuristic methods like the envelope
approach of Dean et al. (1993b) would be useful. We

intend to use the framework to explore a number of
tradeoffs (e.g., as in (Russell and Wefald 1991) ) . In
particular, we will look at the advantages of a deeper
search tree, and balance this with the cost of building
such a tree, and at the tradeoff between computation
time and improved results when building the heuristic
function. To illustrate these ideas we observe that if
the depth of the search tree is 0, this corresponds to
a reactive system where the best action for each state
is obtained from the abstract polic y. If each cluster
for the abstract policy contains a single state, we have
optimal policy planning. The usefulness of these trade­
oft's will vary when planning in different domains.
Some of the characteristics of domains that will affect
our choices are:
•

•

Time: for time-critical domains it may be better
to limit time spent deliberating (perhaps adopting
a reactive strategy based on the heuristic func­
tion). A more detailed heuristic function and a
smaller search tree may be appropriate.
Continuity: if actions have similar effects in large
classes of states and most of the goal states are
fairly similar, we can use a less detailed heuristic
function (more abstract policy).

•

Fan-out: if there are relatively few actions, and
each action has a small number of outcomes, we
can afford to increase the depth of the search tree.

•

Plausible goals: if goal states are hard to reach, a
deeper search tree and a more detailed heuristic
function may be necessary.

•

Extreme probabilities: with extreme probabilities
it may be worth only expanding the tree for the
most probable outcomes of each action. This
seems to bear some relationship to the envelope
reconstruction phase of the recurrent deliberation
model of Dean et al. (1993a).

In the future we hope to continue our experimen­
tal investigation of the algorithm to look at the ef­
fectiveness of variable-depth search, and the possibil­
ity of improving the heuristic function by recording
newly computed values of states, rather than best ac­
tions. We also hope to investigate the performance

169

of this approach in other types of domains, including
high-level robot navigation, and scheduling problems,
and to further investigate the theoretical properties of
the algorithm, especially through analysis of the value
of deeper searching in producing better plans (Pearl
1984). Our model can be extended by relaxing some of
the assumptions incorporated into the decision-model.
Semi-markov processes as well as partially observable
processes will require interesting modifications of our
model. Finally, we must investigate the degree to
which the restricted envelope approach may be meshed
with our model.
