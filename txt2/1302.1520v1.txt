dicular to the direction of the beam may reflect al­
most no acoustic energy in the direction of the sensor
(which is also the emitter - the sonar(s) mounted on
the robot). We call such a false negative a dropout, al­
though sometimes, rather than generating no reading
at all, the beam, after one or more secondary reflec-

tions, is detected by the sonar (a spurious reading) and
results in a phantom obstacle. This problem becomes
acute if there are many fiat surfaces, which are acousti­
cally "specular" , i.e. reflect almost all acoustic energy
in a narrow cone around the angle of incidence, result­
ing in frequent dropouts, as has been encountered by
various researchers and implementers [12]. The "spec­
ularity" of a surface (determined by material, surface
roughness, etc.) is usually represented as a "critical
angle" from the perpendicular, beyond which the read­
ing is likely to be bogus (in fact the probability that
the reading is bogus may depend on other factors, such
as signal strength, area, etc., but we would like to ab­
stract away from these issues in this paper).
Most schemes that perform sonar mapping consider
information from numerous sonar readings in order to
overcome the errors. In a mapping architecture devel­
oped by Elfes (3], (2D) space is partitioned into a grid,
where each grid point can either be occupied or free.
Each grid point is seen as a random variable, denoting
probability of occupancy. Information is accumulated,
for each grid point, from multiple sonar readings and
robot locations (the latter appear as circles in figure 5),
resulting in an occupancy probability map as in figure
7 (where black stands for high occupancy probabil­
ity). An error model of the sonar reading, that han­
dles mostly range error due to noise and pulse width,
is used. In general, Elfes makes the following inde­
pendence assumption: all grid points are independent
random variables. Updating the occupancy probabil­
ity P(O) of each grid point is done according to the
sensor reading model p(riO),p(ri•O), independently
from updates to other grid points, as follows1:

P( Dnew) =

p( riO)P( Dold)
( 1)
p(riO)P(Oold)+p(ri•O)(l- P(Oo!d))

Another system [1 2] also uses a grid-based scheme,
but with Dempster-Shafer probabilities [2]. Each grid
point (cell) has the values h0 and h1, denoting belief
that the cell is occupied, and belief that the cell is free,
respectively. Update of the model is, again, indepen1 We

discrete probability distribution by P throughout.

Dropouts (false negatives) are handled by direct filter­
ing on successive readings during travel, and the prob­
lem of uncertainty due to wide beam is alleviated by
the facts that: a) The sonar beam width of only about
10°, compared to the roughly 25° beam width of the
standard Polaroid sonars. b) Triangulation between
readings from different robot locations (also facilitated
by the narrower beam). Remaining errors are handled
by the updating mechanism above. One disadvantage
of the scheme is obviously the larger number of read­
ings required due to the narrower beam. The paper
[12] does not give a clear semantics to the prior be­
lief values for the cells. It is also unclear whether the
method is applicable to a more cluttered environment
than the rather simple one in the experiment, or to
objects with a more specular reflectance pattern.
In essence, both schemes assume that grid points are
independent variables, both a-priori and given the
sensing operations. There are several problems in as­
suming independence of grid points and of not keep­
ing track of which readings originated the informa­
tion. Consider, for example, the spatial configuration
of readings in figure 1. In the figure, the sectors are
regions where, had there been an obstacle, the read­
ings would have been other than observed (assuming
no false negatives). The thickened arcs are regions
where some object is likely to be (as a cause for the
�eading value). Using grid-point independence, read­
mg R2 has no effect on the occupancy probability in
region At, whereas the fact that a possible obstacle
in A1S2 is contra-indicated by R2, and a possible ob­
stacle in A1A2 is confirmed by R2, should change the
probability that region A1 is occupied.
Increased probability of occupancy in region A1A2,
and decreased probability of occupancy in region S1S2
occur both in Elfes' model and our own. Extending the
example, consider a reading R3 that might be caused
by an object in region A3, which partially overlaps 51
as in figure 2. The probability that R1 is a dropout�
increases, and this should decrease the probability of
occupancy for region A1. This kind of inference cannot
be handled by a scheme that assumes independence of
grid points, and does independent updates.
2In the cited paper, h values are actually in the range
0 to 100, but that is immaterial.

Figure 2: Spatial Configuration of 3 Sonar Readings

We do not believe that the difficulty, exhibited by ear­
lier Bayesian schemes (e.g. [3]) in handling dropouts,
results from the fact that the model is Bayesian.
Rather, as stated earlier, we hold that this is due to
over-optimistic independence assumptions. Addition­
ally, the fact that sensor models are usually given in
terms of single probability distributions, favors use of
the Bayesian scheme. Our model is based in essence
on Elfes' model, but without assuming that grid point�
are independent, thus overcoming the above problems.
In our scheme, space is dynamically partitioned into
regions (depicted in figures 1, 2 for the above exam­
ples), dependent on the readings. (In our scheme, we
do not necessarily need to quantize space into a grid,
as in prior work.) Hence, our model partitions the
plane into regions which are "quasi-invariant" with re­
spect to the set of readings. That is, if an obstacle
is within a region, moving it elsewhere within the re­
gion (or even adding and removing obstacles from the
region, as long as it is still partially occupied) makes
"almost" no difference in the readings. Each such re­
gion is a potential cause for a set of readings, and may
indicate that some other set of readings are dropouts '
as discussed in the above examples.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol­
lows. Section 2 explains our assumptions, presents the
model, and its realization as a Bayes network [9]. Sec­
tion 3 discusses our implementation of the model. Sec­
tion 4 presents initial simulation results. We conclude
with notes on how to extend the model to handle more
complicated prior models and other types of sensors.

THE SENSING MODEL

We first present and justify our single sonar reading
sensor model assumptions, and then discuss the issue
of independence assumptions we have remaining in the
multi-reading sensing model.
2.1

Assumptions

and Definitions

Our single reading model assumes the following:
1. The probability that an obstacle is detectable by

a reading depends only on whether it is (at least
in part) in a sector in front of the sonar, defined
by the beam-width. Probability of detecting an
object outside the sector is 0.
2. Given a true reading

r, the probability of occu­
pancy of each unit area in the thickened (thick­
ness t:, the reading inaccuracy) arc about distance
r from the sensor is uniform. The probability
that there is an object in the beam at a distance
d < r- f is 0.

3. Spurious readings are uniformly random.
4. The probability of a reading given an object in
the thickened (detection) arc is independent of its
location within the arc3.
All the above assumptions are approximations to a
more realistic sensor model, made so that we can par­
tition space into equi-distributed regions, to facilitate
our main task of correcting dropouts. Assumption
2, uniform distribution (in contrast with the rea.lis­
tic model, of a normal distribution along the distance
axis), is reasonable if the error of a true reading is small
compared to other errors (such as arc length). In many
sonar systems, where distance error is on the order of
1 inch, the above condition holds. Assumption 3 is
very difficult to overcome without further spatial data,
which is unavailable in an unmapped environment, but
we believe that the results are not very sensitive to its
violation.
In order to define a probability distribution over a
set of readings, several independence assumptions are
used, as follows:
1. Readings are independent measurements.

2. Occupancy of regions are (a-priori) independent.
While the first assumption is commonly used, the sec­
ond is more problematic. Prior work (e.g. (3]) makes
this assumption w.r.t. individual occupancy grid cells.
Doing so w.r.t. regions should present no difficulty. In
3Strictly speaking, taken together with assumption 2,
this entails that readings r and distances of objects from
the sonar d are equi-distributed, which involves compli­
cated spatial assumptions.
However, if f is reasonably
small this effect is negligible, and we thus ignore this con­
straint henceforth.

fact, it should be advantageous,

since one can con­
sider the size of a region, as well as its shape, when
determining prior probabilities of occupancy. How­
ever, since regions are arbitrary, and modified dynam­
ically, this is equivalent to assuming independence of
grid points. Later on, we adjust this assumption. The
main difference with prior work is that region occupan­
cies are not independent given the readings, contrary
to Elfes' model.

The resulting probabilistic model for multiple readings
is as follows. Conditional probabilities for each read­
ing are dependent only on the occupancy of regions
within their sector or thickened arc. Let reading r be
a random variable with range [Rmin, RmaxL A,. be its
arc region, and 5,. be its sector. Let free(X) be a pred­
icate that denotes that region X is completely free (i.e.
has no obstacles)4. Then:
p,(r)
p( r !•free( 5,.))
p( r I free(5,.) /1. free(A,.))
(2)
Po(r)
p,.(r)
p(r I free(5,.) /1. ...,free(A,.))
where the three cases stand for a dropout in region
S,., a spurious reading due to noise where no objects
exist (such as crosstalk, sensor error, etc.), and a true
reading, respectively. The probability of a reading is
independent of occupancy of any regions outside 5,.
and A,.. We now define the conditional distributions
p,(r),po(r),p,.(r) in the regions of Rmin::; r ::; Rmax·
Outside this range, the distributions are defined arbi­
trarily, to make them normalized.
Under our assumptions, the conditional distribution
p,.(r) is piecewise uniform, with a high value p� at
roughly the distance of the region A,. from the source,
and low value p� elsewhere inside the sonar range. The
exact ratio depends on the prior probability P,. that
the primary reflection from objects in A,. is detected:
P,. :::: 2cp� . The distribution p,(r), for dropouts in
region S,., is uniform, under the assumptions. As we
have no good model for other sources of errors, and
have not encountered them in our system, we use a
piecewise uniform p0(r), with a low value for all pos­
sible readings (i.e. within the sensor range). In fact,
since the reading in our system is discrete, we use a
discrete probability distribution instead of densities.
For each region X, the probability of free(X) is depen­
dent on area, shape, and location (if there is any prior
information). The set of regions used in the model is
the Cartesian product of the distinct regions of all n
readings. That is, let {A,.,, 5,.,, E,.J be the arc, sector,
and the remaining space for reading ri, respectively.
Then our set of regions, for n readings, is:
n

II {A,.,, S,.,' E,.,}
i=l
Note that although the size of A seems to be expo­
nential in n, there are two mitigating factors: a) In
A=

4We denote the random variables standing for the oc­
cupancy status of an region by its name X, and the state
that it is completely free by the predicate free(X).

Bayes Networks for Sonar Sensor Fusion

practice, most of the regions are spatially empty re­
gions, and are thus ignored. If all thickened arcs and
sectors were convex, the actual maximum number of
non-empty regions would be low-order polynomial in
the number of readings. The arcs are not convex, but
are nearly so, and we would thus expect the number
of regions to be comparatively small. b) In the actual
implementation we use a discrete representation, and
the number of distinct regions is at most equal to the
number of grid points. Henceforth, when we refer to
A, we exclude the spatially empty regions, and in the
implementation actually mean the non-empty regions
in the discrete representation of the sets in A.
Using discrete distributions for the readings, the com­
plete distribution is as follows:
P (r1, ... rn,

s(A))

IJ P(s( A)) IT P(r; I s(A))

=

AEA

(3)

A(r;)

=

{AIAEAAA�(Ar,USr,)}

I A(r;)) is defined in equation 2.
The prior probabilities that each region A is free is
determined by its area, and prior probability of occu­
pancy of a point in the room. We use the piecewise
linear function:
where

P(r;

P(--.free(A))

ax(Pmin + k I A I.Pmax)

= m

(4)

Pmin is the fraction of the space which is occupied,
and Pmax is some probability close to 1. In principle,
one could determine the values k, Pmin and Pmax by
sampling and line-fitting. Admittedly, this scheme is
somewhat ad-hoc, and a better model could be con­
structed, but we believe that this scheme is sufficient
at this point. Note that, strictly speaking, this model
is inconsistent with the assumption of independent re­
gion occupancies, from a dynamic point of view.

If we had a static set of readings, and just assumed
that regions in A are independent, the result would be
consistent. However, if we now add another reading
rn+t, thereby splitting some region A into A1 and A2,
then assuming that At and A2 are still independent
is inconsistent with the inverse probability assignment
function, since: P(A) :f=. P( At)P( A2)·

Proof: Clearly, the exponential probability assignment

every bisection of region A into At, A2 , we have:

and this holds by an inductive version ofthis argument
for every partition of A. Uniqueness of the solution
follows immediately from the the uniqueness theorem
for certain families of differential equations, of which
the equation f(x) = cf'(x) is a member. D
However, using an exponential probability function is
counterintuitive: using any non-0 value of c, we get
that the probability for any small region being free
approaches 1. This effect occurs because of the unre­
alistic assumption of region independence, and ideally,
one should add some prior (possibly Markov) depen­
dency model. For simplicity at this point, we prefer
to slightly (dynamically) violate the independence as­
sumption, by using a non-exponential probability as­
signment, while still assuming that the assumption
holds on each static model.

Realization as a Bayes Network

The probabilistic reasoning issue we need to tackle is
to find the distribution of region occupancies given the
sonar readings. We actually solve a somewhat simpler
problem - finding the (marginal) probability that each
region is occupied given the readings. Representing
the distribution as a Bayes network allows us to use
existing tools to solve the problem.
Equation 3 is a conditional distribution where reading
probability is dependent only on a set of region vari­
ables, and region variables are independent. It thus
exhibits a 2-level dependency structure, and can thus
be implemented as a 2-level Bayes network, one root
node for each region in A, and one sink node for each
reading. 5 However, since the in-degree is essentially
unbounded, and a reading node is not a type of node
for which specialized implementations exist in the lit­
erature (as is the case for, e.g. noisy-or), we prefer to
implement the model as a 3-level network, by adding,
for each reading-node ri, two intermediate (binary val­
ued) parents: "pro" and "con", which are or-nodes,
defined as follows:
1 3A � Ar, -.free( A)
P(pror, =true)
0 otherwise

that readings are assumed independent given the

ment. Likewise, regions are (approximately) in d epe nden t

but must become dependent given the readings.

Hence, the Bayes network must be constructed in the

causal direction: regions preceding readings in the DAG.

We use a constant low Par, = Po (that is, assume few
spurious readin gs that are not dropouts), and Prr, a
constant Pr, a reasonably high probability for initial
experiments. In fact, this number should be deter­
mined by the spatial configuration, but we do not as
yet have a good model for determining it. P,r, = P, is
determined by the prior probability that an object in
the sector will cause no detectable primary reflection
(i.e. that we will get a dropout )6.
Each region A is represented by a binary random vari­
able, denoting free(A), with prior probability as dis­
cussed above. The resulting network can now be im­
plemented with existing Bayes network software that
handles or-nodes as special cases (see implementation
section on using systems with explicit distribution rep­
resentation). Such networks are similar to BN02 net­
works [lJ, except for the negative-cause con nodes. For
example, the Bayes network for the configuration of
Figure 2 is depicted in figure 3.

Figure 5: Scenario 1: Corridor
The probabilistic reasoner constructs the Bayes net
dynamically (using IDEAL [11] in LISP), according to
topological data from the readings analyzer, sets up
the readings as evidence, and performs belief updating.
Dynamic construction of the network is by performing
actions for each new input item, as follows:
1. Add-reading(name, distance): create new reading
node, con node and pro node. Connect them and
set conditional probabilities.
2. Add-region(name, area): create a new region
node, and set up its prior probability according
to its size.
3. Add-cause(region, reading, polarity): add region
node as a parent of pro or con node (according
to polarity) of reading. If an or-node (pro or con
node) has more than 2 parents, add an interme­
diate or-node.

IMPLEMENTATION

The experimental system has two main components:
the readings analyzer, and the probabilistic reasoner
(Figure 4). The former communicates with the No­
madic Software Development package (simulator) for
the Nomad 200 mobile robot (which can also commu­
nicate in turn with the physical Nomad 200 robot).
The readings analyzer is a C++ program consisting
of four modules: The robot activation module, the
analysis module, the output module and the graphics
module. The analyzer uses a data structure with two
partitions: dynamic structure for the sonar readings
and regions, and dynamic grid/pixels relations with
the above structure. Each sonar reading produces two
or more new regions. While it is possible to use a
purely geometrical representation in our model, the
grid was found to be easier and possibly a more effi­
cient way to implement the system in practice.
6We do not divide that probability by the number of

possible readings, since the value "observed" plays the role
of all other incorrect readings, where there is indeed an
obj ect in the sector, which was undetected by the reading.

The intermediate or-nodes in add-cause are a pure im­
plementation issue: our version of IDEAL represents
all nodes as distribution arrays, which may become too
large if we allowed arbitrary in-degree. Additionally,
some of the algorithms we use for belief updating work
better with a small in-degree.

SIMULATION RESULTS

Results presented are for a simulated environment.
The maximal reflection angle (critical angle) was set at
60° for the simulation. We compare the results of our
mapping to results that might be obtained by assum­
ing grid-point independence (the Elfes model), in sev­
eral spatial configurations defined with the simulator's
polygon mode editing. The complexity of the network

generated for a large number of sonar readings forced
us, in the current implementation, to select a partic­
ular mix of readings that does not generate too many
regions, but with some dropouts, in order to show that
our model can discount them. Hence, our experimen­
tal setting is somewhat contrived. The configurations
selected for the paper are 1) a turn in a corridor (fig­
ure 5), and 2) an irregular polygon (figure 6) where the
simulated robot's path shown as a sequence of circles.
Results are presented as an array of gray-level pixels,
with white representing a probability of 0 (for an ob­
stacle), and black a probability of 1, on a linear scale.
The relative grid point scale is 1 inch per grid point.
Sonar arc thickness (error) width was 3 pixels.
In displaying results for independent updates (Figures
7 ,8) we show both the sonar readings, and the occu­
pancy probability computed with the grid-point inde­
pendence assumption, using equation 1, with initial
probability being Pmin=0.3. If the grid point is in the
detection arc of the reading, we used p(r I 0) = 0.9,
and p(r I -,0) = 0.3. If the grid point is in the
"free" sector of a reading, we used p(r I 0) = 0.1
and p(r I -,0) = 0.9. Parameters for our model were
Pr = 0.9 (the probability of true positive), prior prob­
ability of a dropout, P. = 0.1, Po = 0.05, and Pmax
was set at 0.8. Grid points traversed by the robot body
have P(free) = 1.
For comparison, region occupancy probabilities in our
model (which stand for probability that there is some

Figure 9: Scenario 1: Results (Bayes Network)
obstacle anywhere within the region) must be trans­
lated into a probability that a single grid point be
occupied. For any region A, let P(...,free(A)) be its
prior probability of occupancy (from equation 4), and
Pe( -,free(A)) be its posterior probability of occupancy
given the evidence (the readings). Probability of oc­
cupancy for a grid point g in region A is given by:
P(occupied(g))

=

Pmin

Pe(...,free(A))
P(-.free(A))

The above equation is only for comparative display of
the results. We do not intend to argue that it repre­
sents the actual probability that the (region of space
covered by) a grid point is occupied given the evidence.
For scenario 1 (Figure 5), we have 26 readings, result­
ing in 73 regions excluding robot body, with 69 positive
area regions. The network had 104 support arcs. Re­
sults are depicted in figures 9, and 10 (thresholds on
figure 9, set at P(occupied(g)) = 0.25 and 0.35).
For scenario 2 (Figure 6), we have 20 readings. This
resulted in 83 regions, excluding regions covered by
the robot body, and 65 regions after removing regions
including no grid points. The generated Bayes network
had 139 support arcs. Results are depicted in figures
11, and 12.
With the independence assumption, several good read-

DISCUSSION

It is possible to add prior information, or information
from other sensors, into this system. One way to do
this is by using different priors for regions (and other
parameters than just size to decide priors). Another
way is to add a prior dependency model on the regions.
In order to incorporate prior knowledge of objects into
the map (e.g. a wall known to be at a certain posi­
tion, with some given probability), one could further
partition regions to accommodate such known objects.

Figure 11: Scenario 2: Results (Bayes Network)

ings are essentially disregarded (occupancy within the
detection arc less than the global prior, Pmin) due to
one or more dropouts. The system would thus tend to
ignore some nearby obstacles. Our model overcomes
dropouts in both scenarios: probability of region oc­
cupancy higher than prior, despite the dropouts. The
latter are much discounted, as shown by applying of
thresholds to the results. This property occurs due to
the fact that detection arcs of different readings (even
disjoint ones), occuring wholly or partially within a
"free" sector (of a dropout), tend to support each other
in the model, and to decrease the probability that the
"free" sector of the dropout is, indeed, free.
Evaluation time for the above Bayes networks was
about 1 CPU-minute on a Spare ELC, with the Jensen
(junction-tree) algorithm in IDEAL. However, with
more readings, or readings with a larger tendency to
intersect, computation time grows rapidly. A configu­
ration (not shown) with 25 readings and 115 regions,
and took 4 hours CPU time. Larger configurations
could not be evaluated at all. This problem is par­
tially addressed below.

One weakness of our system is in coping with regis­
tration or location errors: if the location of a known
object is incorrect, incorporating that is somewhat dif­
ficult. That is because the system cannot tell where
region partitions should be added. Although one pos­
sible solution would be to add a fine partition, cater­
ing for all possible placements of the object, this would
clearly by inefficient. A similar problem is encountered
if the location of the sensors (w.r.t. earlier placement
of the sensors) is known imprecisely. In both cases,
the problem is not severe if the error is small. Using
localization schemes available in the literature one can
solve the latter problem. Handling the location errors
for other objects is still an open problem.
Currently, the system handles only the "gross" uncer­
tainty resulting from sonar readings, caused by the
beam-width and secondary reflections. It would be
desirable to incorporate handling of the "small" errors
resulting from inexact readings, which are handled by
various sensor fusion schemes, such as Kalman filter­
ing. In principle, this may be done after the "gross"
sources of error have been eliminated.
Another obvious problem is that the Bayes network
quickly becomes too large for evaluation by general,
exact methods. We are considering several directions
for overcoming the problem, as follows:
1. Using a scheme similar to that used in [1] for the
somewhat similar BN02 networks.
2. Make decisions about regions A that have ex­
treme probabilities P( free( A)), after a few read-

Bayes Networks for Sonar Sensor Fusion

ings, thus partitioning, as well as decreasing the
size of the network.
3. Using order of magnitude probabilities as an ap­
proximation.
4. Using sampling algorithms (e.g. [6, 10]). Initial
experiments in [1OJ show some measure of success

with this method.
Numerous other papers have time-dependent or dy­
namic Bayes network for handling problems of uncer­
tainty in sensing and results of actions. They all, how­
ever, deal with different kinds of sensors and environ­
ments. For example, [8] has a discrete spatial represen­
tation in terms of "rooms" where light beam sensors
are placed at the doors, to detect crossing objects. Dis­
crete locations of moving objects are then estimated by
dynamically constructing a Bayes network and evalu­
ating it. Sensors may either fail to detect objects, or
detect "ghosts". The spatial configuration in that pa­
per is essentially reduced to a topology, whereas in
our paper, the spatial geometry is important. Note
that in our paper, the grid is used just as a convenient
computational aid, and in fact we could have used a
continuous geometrical representation of regions. The
latter is not possible in [8].
Other examples are in traffic scene analysis [7], which
uses Bayes networks to track discrete objects (cars),
and in the BATmobile autonomous vehicle simulation
[4] which uses Bayes networks to decide the position
of obstacles (e.g. other cars). In both papers, the
inherent assumption is that we can separate out the
individual objects, which is indeed possible due to e.g.
relative motion. That is not possible in our domain,
and hence we need to use a different sensor model.

This paper presents a probabilistic model for "gross"
sonar sensor fusion, that relaxes several independence
assumptions made in related work. Such assump­
tions may be over-optimistic for various environments.
The dependencies we introduced between read in gs
are represented by the topology of a (dynamically
constructed) Bayes network, which also represents
the conditional distributions between elements of the
model (readings and spatial regions). Initial exper­
iments indicate that the model can overcome spuri­
ous sonar reflections, by accumulating evidence from
a number of readings, and thus greatly discount the
impact of the bogus readings. This evidence accumu­
lation is done automatically by the probability updat­
ing mechanism for the probability model (as imple­
mented by the Bayes network). We believe that the
method is reasonably easy to extend to incorporating
prior information, both certain and uncertain, as well
as information from other types of sensors.
