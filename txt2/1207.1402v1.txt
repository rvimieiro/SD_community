granularity, at a high computational cost. This problem
is even more acute in a learning setting, when little prior
knowledge might exist about the rate of evolution of different variables in the system.
Another approach is to model such systems as evolving
over continuous time. For discrete state systems, such
representations include event history analysis (Blossfeld
et al., 1988; Blossfeld & Rohwer, 1995) and Markov process models (Duffie et al., 1996; Lando, 1998). Nodelman
et al. (2002) extend these representations with ideas from
the framework of Bayesian networks, to define continuous
time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) — a structured representation for complex systems evolving over continuous time.
An important task for any model is constructing it. One
approach for acquiring models that fit the domain is by
learning them from data samples. Nodelman et al. (2003)
present an algorithm for learning a CTBN — both structure and parameters — from fully observed data. However,
in many real-world applications, we obtain only partial observations of the trajectory. This issue is likely to be even
more acute when learning continuous time models where
it is difficult to observe everything all the time. Therefore,
learning networks from partially observed data is an important problem with real-world significance.
In this paper, we provide an algorithm, based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al.,
1977), for learning CTBN parameters from partially observable data. We also provide an extension, based on
structural EM (Friedman 1997; 1998), for learning the network structure from such data. Our algorithm also provides
us with a solution to one of the major limitations of both
CTBN and DBN models — their use of a transition model
which evolves exponentially (or geometrically) with time.
In particular, we build on the rich class of phase distributions (Neuts 1975; 1981), showing how to integrate them
into a CTBN model, and how to use our EM algorithm to
learn them from data. We present results of our learning algorithm on real world data related to people’s life histories,

and show that our learned CTBN model with phase distribution transitions is a better model of the data than both
learned DBN and learned CTBN models.

2 EM for Markov Processes
We begin by reviewing the process of EM for homogeneous Markov processes, on which our algorithm for
CTBNs is strongly based. Variants of this problem have
been addressed by various authors, including Sundberg
(1974; 1976), Dembo and Zeitouni (1986), Asmussen et al.
(1996), and Holmes and Rubin (2002). Our presentation is
based on the formulation of Asmussen et al. (1996).
2.1 Homogeneous Markov Processes
A finite state, continuous time, homogeneous Markov process Xt with state space Val(X) = {x1 , . . . , xn } is de0
scribed by an initial distribution PX
and an n × n matrix of
transition intensities:

of transitioning from state xi
where qxi xj is the intensity
P
to state xj and qxi = j6=i qxi xj . The intensity qxi gives
the “instantaneous probability” of leaving state xi and the
intensity qxi xj gives the ‘instantaneous probability’ of transitioning from xi to xj . More formally, as ∆t → 0,
Pr{X(t + ∆t) = xj | X(t) = xi } ≈ qxi xj ∆t, for i 6= j
Pr{X(t + ∆t) = xi | X(t) = xi } ≈ 1 − qxi ∆t .

The transient behavior of Xt is as follows. Variable X
stays in state x for time T exponentially distributed with
parameter qx . The probability density function f for Xt
remaining at x is f (qx , t) = qx exp(−qx t) for t ≥ 0,and
the expected time of transition is 1/qx . Upon transitioning,
X shifts to state x′ with probability qxx′ /qx .
The distribution over transitions of X factors into two
pieces — exponential for when the next transition occurs
and multinomial for where the state transitions, i.e., the
next state. The natural parameters are qx for the exponential distribution and θxx′ = qxx′ /qx , x′ 6= x for the multinomial distribution.
The distribution over the state of the process X at some
future time t, PX (t), can be computed directly from QX .
0
is the distribution over X at time 0, then

where exp is matrix exponentiation.
2.2 Incomplete Data
For a Markov process X, our data are a set of partially
observed trajectories D = {σ[1], . . . , σ[w]} that describe

the behavior of X. A complete trajectory can be specified
as a sequence of states xi of X, each with an associated
duration. This means we observe every transition of the
system from one state to the next and the time at which it
occurs. In contrast, a partially observed trajectory σ ∈ D
can be specified as a sequence of subsystems Si of X, each
with an associated duration. A subsystem is simply a nonempty subset of states of X, in which we know the system
stayed fur the duration of the observation. Some transitions
are partially observed — we know only that they take us
from one subsystem to another. Transitions from one state
to another within the subsystem are wholly unobserved —
hence we do not know how many there are nor when they
occur.
Note that momentary observation of the state of the system, or point evidence can also described in this framework. In particular, in the sequence of observed subsystems, durations can zero.
For each trajectory σ[i] we can consider a space H[i] of
possible completions of that trajectory. Each completion
h[i] ∈ H[i] specifies, for each transition of σ[i], which
underlying transition of X occurred and also specifies all
the entirely unobserved transitions of X. Combining σ[i]
and h[i] gives us a complete trajectory σ + [i] over X. Note
that, in a partially observed trajectory, the number of possible unobserved transitions is unknown. Moreover, there
are uncountably many times at which each transition can
take place. Thus, the set of possible completions of a partial trajectory σ is, in general, the union of a countably infinite number of spaces, which are real-valued spaces of
unbounded dimension. Nevertheless, the notion of all possible completions is well-defined. We can define the set
D+ = {σ + [1], . . . , σ + [w]} of completions of all of the
partial trajectories in D.

Example 2.1 Suppose we have a process X whose state
space is Val(X) = {y1 , y2 } × {z1 , z2 }. Consider the following example σ + of a fully observed trajectory over the
time interval [0, 2): X starts in hy1 , z2 i at time 0; at time
0.5 it transitions to hy2 , z2 i; at time 1.7 it transitions to
hy2 , z1 i.
Note we can write h·, zi i for the subsystem consisting of
the states hy1 , zi i and hy2 , zi i. An example partially observed trajectory σ over the interval [0, 2) is: X starts in
h·, z1 i; at time 1.7 it transitions to h·, z2 i. Note that σ +
is a completion of σ. Another possible completion of σ is:
X starts in hy2 , z1 i at time 0; at time 1.0 it transitions to
hy1 , z1 i; at time 1.7 it transitions to hy1 , z2 i.
We can describe a partially observed trajectory σ ′ with
point evidence at time 0.7 and 1.8: X starts in h·, ·i; at time
0.7 we observe h·, z2 i; from time 0.7 to 1.8 we observe X in
h·, ·i; at time 1.8 we observe X in h·, z1 i; from time 1.8 on,
we observe X in h·, ·i. Note that σ + is also a completion
of σ ′ .

2.3 Expected Sufficient Statistics and Likelihood
+

The sufficient statistics of a set of complete trajectories D
for a Markov process are T [x] — the total amount of time
that X = x, and M [x, x′ ] — the number
P of times X transitions from x to x′ . If we let M [x] = x′ M [x, x′ ] we can
write the log-likelihood for X (Nodelman et al., 2003):
ℓX (q, θ : D+ ) = ℓX (q : D+ ) + ℓX (θ : D+ )

Let r be a probability density over each completion H[i]
which, in turn, yields a density over possible completions
of the data D+ . We can write the expectations of the
sufficient statistics with respect to the probability density
over possible completions of the data: T̄ [x], M̄ [x, x′ ], and
M̄ [x]. These expected sufficient statistics allow us to write
the expected log-likelihood for X as
Er [ℓX (q, θ : D+ )] = Er [ℓX (q : D+ )] + Er [ℓX (θ : D+ )]

2.4 The EM Algorithm
We use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm
(Dempster et al., 1977) to find maximum likelihood parameters q, θ of X. The EM algorithm begins with an arbitrary
initial parameter assignment, q 0 , θ0 . It then repeats the two
steps below, updating the parameter set, until convergence.
After the kth iteration we start with parameters q k , θk :
Expectation Step. Using the current set of parameters,
we define for each σ[i] ∈ D, the probability density
rk (h[i]) = p(h[i] | σ[i], q k , θk )

(1)

We then compute expected sufficient statistics T̄ [x],
M̄ [x, x′ ], and M̄ [x] according to this posterior density
over completions of the data given the data and the model.
Maximization Step. Using the expected sufficient statistics we just computed as if they came from a complete data
set, we set q k+1 , θk+1 to be the new maximum likelihood
parameters for our model as follows
qxk+1 =

M̄ [x]

T̄ [x]

The difficult part in this algorithm is the Expectation Step.
As we discussed, the space over which we are integrating
is highly complex, and it is not clear how we can compute
the expected sufficient statistics in a tractable way. This
problem is the focus of the next section.

3 Computing Expected Sufficient Statistics
Given an n-state homogeneous Markov process Xt with
intensity matrix QX , our task is to compute the expected

sufficient statistics with respect to the posterior probability
density over completions of the data given the observations
and the current model. For simplicity, we omit the explicit
dependence on the parameters q k , θk . Our analysis follows
the work of Asmussen et al. (1996), who utilize numerical
integration via the Runge-Kutta method. Holmes and Rubin (2002) provide an alternative approach using the eigenvalue decomposition of the intensity matrix.
3.1 Notation
In order to compute the expected sufficient statistics over
D, we compute them for each partially observed trajectory
σ ∈ D separately and then combine the results.
A partially observed trajectory σ is given as a sequence
of N subsystems so that the state is restricted to subsystem
Si during interval [ti , ti+1 ) for 0 ≤ i ≤ (N − 1). Without
loss of generality, we assume that σ begins at time 0 and
ends at time τ so t0 = 0 and tN = τ .
For subsystem S, let QS be the n × n intensity matrix
QX with all intensities zeroed out except those corresponding to transitions within the subsystem S (and associated
diagonal elements). For subsystems S1 , S2 , let QS1 S2 be
the n × n intensity matrix QX with all intensities zeroed
out except those corresponding to transitions from S1 to
S2 . Note that this means all the intensities corresponding
to transitions within S1 and within S2 are also zeroed out.
Sometimes it is convenient to refer to evidence by providing an arbitrary time interval. Let σt1 :t2 denote the evidence provided by σ over the interval [t1 , t2 ). (So, σ0:τ is
the evidence provided by all of σ.) Let σt1 :t+ denote the
2
evidence over the interval [t1 , t2 ], and σt− :t2 the evidence
1
over the interval (t1 , t2 ).
Let e be a (column) n-vector of ones. Let ej be an nvector of zeros with a one in position j. Let ∆j,k be an
n × n matrix of zeros with a one in position j, k. (So
∆j,k = ej e′k .) Note that all multiplications below are standard vector and matrix multiplications as opposed to factor
multiplications.
+
Define the vectors α−
t and β t component-wise as
α−
t [i] = p(Xt− = i, σ0:t )
β+
t [i] = p(σt+ :τ | Xt+ = i),
where, if X transitions at t, Xt− is the value of X just prior
to the transition, and Xt+ the value just afterward. (If there
is no transition, Xt− = Xt+ .) Moreover, recall that σ0:t
represents the evidence over interval [0, t) not including t
and σt+ :τ represents evidence over interval (t, τ ) not including t. Thus, neither of these vectors include evidence
of a transition at time t. We also define the vectors
αt [i] = p(Xt = i, σ0:t+ )
βt [i] = p(σt:τ | Xt = i)
both of which include evidence of any transition at time t.

3.2 Expected Amount of Time
The sufficient statistic T [j] is the amount of time that X
spends in state j over the course of trajectory σ. We can
write the expectation of T [j] according to the posterior
probability density given the evidence as
Z τ
E[T [j]] =

p(σ0:τ ) i=0 ti

The constant fraction at the beginning of the last line serves
to make the total expected time over all j sum to τ .
We must show how to compute the above integrals over
intervals of constant evidence. Let [v, w) be such an interval, and let S be the subsystem to which the state is restricted on this interval. Then we have
Z w
p(Xt , σ0:τ )ej dt

Zv w
=
αv exp(QS (t − v))∆j,j exp(QS (w − t))β w dt .
v

The code accompanying Asmussen et al. (1996) is easily extendable to this more general case and can compute
the above integral via the Runge-Kutta method of fourth
order. This method traverses the interval in small discrete
steps each of which has a constant number of matrix multiplications. Thus, the main factor in the complexity of this
algorithm is the number of steps which is a function of the
step size. Importantly, the integration uses a step size that
is adaptive and not fixed. The intensities of the QS matrix
represent rates of evolution for the variables in the cluster,
so larger intensities mean a faster rate of change which usually requires a smaller step size. We begin with a step size
proportional to the inverse of the largest intensity in QS .
The step size thus varies across different subsystems and
is sensitive to the current evidence. Also, following Press
et al. (1992), we use a standard adaptive procedure that allows larger steps to be taken when possible based on error
estimates.
We can calculate the total expected time, E[T [j]], by
summing the above expression over all intervals of constant
evidence.
3.3 Expected Number of Transitions
The sufficient statistic M [j, k] (j 6= k) is the number of
times X transitions from state j to state k over the course

of trajectory σ. Following the derivation in Asmussen
et al. (1996), we consider discrete time approximations of
M [j, k] and take the limit as the size of our discretization
goes to zero, yielding an exact equation. For ǫ > 0, let
τ /ǫ−1

Mǫ [j, k] =

X

1{Xtǫ = j, X(t+1)ǫ = k} .

t=0

Note that our discrete approximation is dominated by the
actual value, i.e., |Mǫ [j, k]| ≤ M [j, k], and also that as ǫ ↓
0, Mǫ [j, k] → M [j, k]. Hence, by dominated convergence
for conditional expectations, we have
E[M [j, k]] = lim E[Mǫ [j, k]] .
ǫ↓0

This last expectation can be broken down as
τ /ǫ−1

E[Mǫ [j, k]] =

X p(Xtǫ = j, X(t+1)ǫ = k, σ0:τ )
.
p(σ0:τ )
t=0

Note that, for ǫ small enough, we observe at most one transition per interval. Thus, each of the intervals in the sum
falls into one of two categories: either the interval contains
a (partially observed) transition, or the evidence is constant
over the interval. We treat each of these cases separately.
Let [tǫ, (t + 1)ǫ) be an interval containing a partially observed transition at time ti . We observe only that we are
transitioning from one of the states of Si to one of the states
of Si+1 . We can calculate the contribution of this interval
to the expected sufficient statistics (ignoring the constant
1/p(σ0:τ )) as
p(Xtǫ = j, X(t+1)ǫ = k, σ0:τ )
= p(Xtǫ = j, σ0:tǫ )p(X(t+1)ǫ = k, σtǫ:(t+1)ǫ | Xtǫ = j)
p(σ(t+1)ǫ:τ | X(t+1)ǫ = k) .
As ǫ ↓ 0, we have the probability of the state and the evidence up to, but not including, time ti , times the instantaneous probability of transitioning from state j to state k,
times the probability of the evidence given the state just
after ti . Thus, at the limit, this transition’s contribution is

Now consider the case when we are within an interval
[v, w) = [ti , ti+1 ) of constant evidence — i.e., it does not
contain a partially observed transition and will generally
be of length much larger than ǫ. Let ∆t = w − v and let
S be the subsystem to which the state is restricted on this
interval. As ǫ grows small, the contribution of this interval

to the sum (again, ignoring 1/p(σ0:τ )) is

As in the case with observed transitions, as ǫ ↓ 0, the middle term becomes qjk dt, the instantaneous probability of
transitioning. Since exp(QS t) is continuous, we can express the limit as a sum of integrals of the form
Z w

We have one such term for each interval of constant evidence. Essentially we are integrating the instantaneous
probability of transitioning from state j to k over the interval given the evidence. Note that this is very similar to
the form of Eq. (3) — the only difference is the matrix ∆j,k
and the term qjk .
To obtain the overall sufficient statistics, we have a sum
with two types of terms: a term as in Eq. (4) for each observed transition, and an integral as in Eq. (5) for each interval of constant evidence. The overall expression is

We can now extend the EM algorithm to continuous time
Bayesian networks which are a factored representation for
homogeneous Markov processes.

3.4 Computing αt and βt
One method of computing αt and βt is via a forwardbackward style algorithm (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) over the
entire trajectory to incorporate evidence and get distributions over the state of the system at every time ti .
We have already defined the forward and backward probability vectors, αt and β t . To initialize the vectors, we
simply let α0 be the initial distribution over the state and
β τ = e, a vector of ones. To update the vectors from their
previously computed values, we calculate
αti+1 = αti exp(QSi (ti+1 − ti ))QSi Si+1
β ti = QSi−1 Si exp(QSi (ti+1 − ti ))β ti+1
To exclude incorporation of the evidence of the transition
from either forward or backward vector (or if the time in

4.1 Continuous Time Bayesian Networks
We briefly review continuous time Bayesian networks as
presented in Nodelman et al. (2003). A CTBN represents a stochastic process over a structured state space,
consisting of assignments to some set of local variables
X = {X1 , X2 , . . . , Xk }.
We model the joint dynamics of these local variables by
allowing the transition model of each local variable to be a
Markov process whose parameterization depends on some
subset of other variables U. The key building block is a
conditional Markov process:
Definition 4.1 A conditional Markov process X is an
inhomogeneous Markov process whose intensity matrix
varies with time, but only as a function of the current values of a set of discrete conditioning variables U. Its intensity matrix, called a conditional intensity matrix (CIM), is

written QX|U and can be viewed as a set of homogeneous
intensity matrices QX|u — one for each instantiation of
values u to U.
The parameters of QX|U are q X|u = {qx|u : x ∈ Val(X)}
and θX|u = {θxx′ |u : x, x′ ∈ Val(X), x 6= x′ }.
We can now combine a set of conditional Markov processes to form a CTBN:
Definition 4.2 A continuous time Bayesian network N
over X consists of two components: an initial distribution
P 0X , specified as a Bayesian network B over X, and a
continuous transition model, specified as
• A directed (possibly cyclic) graph G whose nodes are
X1 , . . . , Xk ; PaG (Xi ), often abbreviated Ui , denotes
the parents of Xi in G.
• A conditional intensity matrix, QXi |Ui , for each variable Xi ∈ X.
Example 4.3 Figure 1 shows the graph structure for
a modified version of the drug effect CTBN network
from Nodelman et al. (2002) modelling the effect of a drug
a person might take to alleviate pain in their joints. There
are nodes for the uptake of the drug and for the resulting
concentration of the drug in the bloodstream. The concentration is affected by how full the patient’s stomach is. The
pain may be aggravated by changing pressure. The model
contains a cycle, indicating that whether a person is hungry depends on how full their stomach is, which depends
on whether or not they are eating, which in turn depends
on whether they are hungry.
4.2 Expected Log-likelihood
Extending the EM algorithm to CTBNs involves making
it sensitive to a factored state space. Our incomplete data,
D, are now partially observed trajectories describing the
behavior of a dynamic system factored into a set of state
variables X.
As shown by Nodelman et al. (2003), the log-likelihood
decomposes as a sum of local log-likelihoods for each variable. Specifically, given variable X, let U be its parent set
in N . Then the sufficient statistics of D+ for our model are
T [x|u], the total amount of time that X = x while U = u,
and M [x, x′ |u], the number of times X transitions
from x
P
to x′ while U = u. If we let M [x|u] = x′ M [x, x′ |u]
the likelihood for each variable X further decomposes as
ℓX (q, θ : D+ ) = ℓX (q : D+ ) + ℓX (θ : D+ )

By linearity of expectation, the expected log-likelihood
function also decomposes in the say way, and we can

write the expected log-likelihood Er [ℓ(q, θ : D+ )] as a
sum of terms (one for each variable X) in the same form
asEq. (6), except using the expected sufficient statistics
T̄ [x|u], M̄ [x, x′ |u], and M̄ [x|u].
4.3 EM for CTBNs
The EM algorithm for CTBNs is essentially the same as
for homogeneous Markov processes. We need only specify how evidence in the CTBN induces evidence on the induced Markov process, and how expected sufficient statistics in the Markov process give us the necessary sufficient
statistics for the CTBN.
A CTBN is a homogeneous Markov process over the joint
state space of its constituent variables. Any assignment of
values to a subset of the variables forms a subsystem of
the CTBN — it restricts us to a subset of the joint state
space (as shown with binary “variables” Y and Z in Example 2.1). Just as before, our evidence can be described
as a sequence of subsystems Si , each with an associated
duration.
Recall that, in a CTBN, the expected sufficient statistics
have the form T̄ [x|u] and M̄ [x, x′ |u]. We can thus replace
Eq. (2) in the maximization step of EM with:
k+1
qx|u
=

M̄[x|u]
;
T̄ [x|u]

k+1
θxx
′ |u =

M̄ [x,x′ |u]
M̄ [x|u]

.

(7)

The expectation step of EM can, in principle, be done by
flattening the CTBN into a single homogeneous Markov
process with a state space exponential in the number of
variables and following the method described above. In
this case, we can compute T̄ [x|u] by summing up all of the
expected sufficient statistics T̄ [j] for any state j consistent
with X = x, U = u. Similarly, M̄ [x|u] can be computed
by summing up all of M̄ [j, k] for state j consistent with
X = x, U = u and k consistent with X = x′ , U = u.
However, as the number of variables in the CTBN grows,
that process becomes intractable, so we are forced to use
approximate inference. The approximate inference algorithm must be able to compute approximate versions of
the forward and backward messages αt , β w . It must also
be able to extract the relevant sufficient statistics — themselves a sum over an exponentially large space — from the
approximate messages efficiently.
A companion paper (Nodelman et al., 2005) provides a
cluster graph inference algorithm which can be used to perform this type of approximate inference. For each segment
[ti , ti+1 ) of continuous fixed evidence, we construct a cluster graph data structure, whose nodes correspond to clusters of variables Ck , each encoding a distribution over the
trajectories of the variables Ck for the duration [ti , ti+1 ).
A message-passing process calibrates the clusters. We can
then extract from the cluster Ck both beliefs about the momentary state of the variables Ck at time ti and ti+1 , as well
as a distribution over the trajectories of Ck during the interval. The former provide a factored representation of our

1

forward message αti+1 and backward message βti , and are
incorporated into the cluster graphs for the adjoining cluster in a forward-backward message passing process. The
cluster distributions are represented as local intensity matrices, from which we can compute the expected sufficient
statistics over families Xi , Ui , as above. This, this algorithm allows us to perform the steps required for the E-step,
and the M-step can be performed easily as described above.

4.4 Structural EM for CTBNs
We can also learn structure from incomplete data by applying the structural EM (SEM) algorithm of Friedman (1997)
to our setting. We start with some initial graph structure
G 0 , initial parameters q 0 , θ 0 , and dataset D.
At each iteration, as with SEM for Bayesian networks, we
choose between taking a step to update the parameters and
taking a step to modify the structure.
Parameter Update Step. Run the EM algorithm, computing new expected sufficient statistics and updating the
parameters as in Eq. (7).
Structure Modification Step. Using the current parameterization and expected sufficient statistics, choose a structure modification that increases the score. SEM is used
with a variety of scores, most commonly the BIC score or
the Bayesian score with expected sufficient statistics as if
real. In both cases, the score can be written in terms of expected sufficient statistics, allowing SEM to be used with
our algorithm above.
SEM leaves unspecified the issue of how many greedy
search steps one takes before recomputing the expected
sufficient statistics and parameters. Nodelman et al. (2003)
showed that, for CTBNs, structure search for a fixed number of parents per node can be done in polynomial time.
Thus, it is possible, in this setting, to find the globally
optimal structure given the current parametrization in the
structure modification step. If one does this, SEM for
CTBNs becomes an iterated optimization algorithm with
a full maximization step for both structure and parameters.

5 Complex Duration Distributions
An important limitation to the expressive power in continuous time Bayesian networks has been the restriction to
modelling durations in a single state as exponential distributions over time. With the extension of the EM to CTBNs,
we can now address this limitation.
5.1 Phase Distributions
Phase distributions are a rich, semi-parametric class of distributions over durations, that use the exponential distribution as a building blcok. A phase distribution is modeled
as a set of phases, through which a process evolves. Each
of these phases is associated with an exponential distribution, which encodes the duration that a process stays in that

loop. (b): The probability density of the first time to leave state 1

to leave state 1.

phase. That is, we enter a phase k, and then leave in time t
exponentially distributed with the parameter qk associated
with that phase. We can view the process as moving over a
directed, possibly cyclic graph, consisting of these phases.
Thus, we can create combinations of chains, mixtures, and
loops of such exponentially distributed phases linked together in a variety of ways. We spend some amount of time
going from one phase to another, but eventually we leave
the set of phases altogether. The distribution over when we
leave such a system of phases is called a phase distribution.

process PHt with intensity matrix

If the intensities of states 1, 2, and 3 are non-zero, then regardless of the initial phase, PHt will end up in state 4 and
remain there. Thus, state 4 is called an absorbing state and
the others are called transient states. We call the transient
states phases and the distribution over when PHt reaches
state 4 is called a phase distribution. In this particular case
it has 3 phases. If we wanted to encode a chain 1 → 2 → 3,
we would have all off-diagonal entries equal to 0, except
q12 , q23 , q34 . If we wanted to encode a loop, we would also
allow q31 6= 0. Figure 2 shows some simple distribution
shapes that can be formed with 3 phases. Note that, while
a chain distribution always begin in phase 1 and ends in
some final phase p, general phase distributions might start
and end in any phase (e.g., the mixture distribution shown).
Definition 5.2 A phase distribution of p phases is defined
as the distribution over time when a homogeneous Markov
process with a single absorbing state and p transient
phases reaches absorption (Neuts 1975; 1981).
We can specify a p-phase distribution with a p × p matrix,
QP , by including only the subsystem of transient phases
without losing any information. The rows of the new intensity matrix will have a (possibly) negative row sum, where

2

the missing intensity corresponds exactly to the intensity
with which we leave the entire system.
Phase distributions with a single phase are simply exponential distributions. The general class is highly expressive: any distribution can be approximated with arbitrary
precision by a phase distribution with some finite number
of phases (Neuts, 1981). A commonly used subclass of
phase distributions is the Erlangian-p which can be constructed with a chain-structured subsystem of p phases,
where all phases have the same exit intensity.
5.2 CTBN Durations as Phase Distributions
One can directly model the distribution in state x of variable X in CTBN N as any phase distribution instead of
an exponential distribution. This idea is first described
by Nodelman and Horvitz (2003) and subsequently in
Gopalratnam et al. (2005). The former focuses on Erlang
distributions and the latter on Erlang-Coxian distributions
both of which are limited subclasses of general phase distributions. In particular neither allow for the exponential
phases to be looped. Restriction to subclasses makes learning from data easier; in particular, EM is not required necessary to learn distributions in these classes; however, these
subclasses have several drawbacks, including reduced expressivity, especially with small numbers of phases (Asmussen et al., 1996). Our method, as it is based on a general
EM algorithm, allows the use of general phase distributions
in CTBNs without restriction.
When using this phase modelling method, the structure
of the intensity matrix must be altered by adding phases as
additional rows (and columns). We use the term phases to
distinguish additional hidden state in the intensity matrix
from states of the variable. Thus, a subsystem of several
phases is used to implement a single state of a variable. In
this context there is no absorption and the “final” transition
of the phase distribution is the transition of the variable to
its the next state.
Example 5.3 To make a binary variable W have the duration in each of its 2 states be Erlangian-3 distributions
(with distinct parameters), we write its intensity matrix as

The top three rows correspond to state w1 and the bottom
three to state w2 . Note that when restricted to modelling
with Erlang distributions for a fixed number of phases, the
number of free parameters is the same as a regular (exponentially distributed) CTBN.
Using phase modelling greatly extends the expressive
power of CTBNs and fits naturally within the existing
CTBN framework. The basic structure of existing algorithms for CTBNs remains unaltered.

The child of a variable with complex durations sees only
the state of its parent and so does not, in general, depend on
the current phase of a parent. There are a number of design
choices to make in implementing phase distributions for
durations in CTBNs. Different choices may be appropriate
for different applications. One can add phases in a uniform
way to each state of each variable — as in example 5.3
where each state gets three phases. Alternatively, one might
allow some states of some variables to be modelled with
more phases than others.
When the parent instantiation changes, one might allow
the child in its current state to stay in the same phase or to
reset. Care must be taken when allowing the child to stay
in the same phase — it requires consistency at least in the
number of phases allowed for each state across all parent
instantiations. When the phase distribution does not have
a distinguished start phase, there is also a choice about the
distribution over phases with which one enters a state. In
particular, there might be a fixed distribution over phases
with which one always enters a particular state or that distribution might depend upon the previous state or the current parent instantiation.
Our observations of a phase-distributed variable are always partial in that we might observe the current state of
a variable but never its associated phase. We can learn the
parameters for a CTBN with phase distributions using the
EM algorithm described above by viewing it as a regular
partially observed process.
5.3 Using Hidden Variables
An alternate method of allowing complex duration distributions for the states of a variable X in CTBN N is to introduce a special hidden variable HX as a parent of X. This
has the advantage of being a very clean way to add expressive power to CTBNs. Without this technique, the parents
of X must be other variables that we are modelling in our
domain which means that the intensities which control the
evolution of X can only change when a regular modelled
variable changes. The addition of a hidden parent allows us
to describe more complex distributions over trajectories of
X by allowing the intensities which control the evolution
of X to change more frequently.
There are different ways to add a hidden variable HX
as a parent of X. We might force HX to have no parents, or allow it to have parents in addition to X having
parents. However, while adding an explicit hidden variable with clear semantics might be useful, it is important to
realize that all complex duration distributions expressible
through use of hidden variables are expressible by direct
phase modelling of the state. For example, suppose HX
has 3 states and X has 2 states. Using direct phases, we
can rewrite a 6 × 6 intensity matrix for X having 3 phases
for each of its 2 states corresponding to the hidden state
of HX . More generally, we can amalgamate a set of hidden parents H X and X into a single cluster node S, whose

parents are the union of X’s parents other than H X and the
parents of X X . Each state of X now corresponds to a set
of instantiations to S. We can reinterpret the amalgamated
CIM for S (given its parents) as a phase distribution for X,
with |Val(H X )| phases per state of X. Thus, we can show:
Theorem 5.4 For a fixed number of phases p, a CTBN
variable X with direct phase modelling for durations, i.e.,
using |X| · p rows for QX , is strictly more expressive than
a variable with complex durations modelled by using a hidden parent HX with p states.
Conversely, many complex duration distributions expressible by direct phase modelling cannot be expressed
using hidden variables. In particular, the joint behavior of
HX and X is restricted in that X and HX cannot transition
simultaneously. This corresponds to the constraint that QS
must have zeros in locations that correspond to a simultaneous shift in the state of X and HX . No such constraint
holds in direct phase modelling which means that we have
more free parameters to describe the distribution.

6 Results
We implemented the EM and SEM algorithms described
above. We used exact inference by constructing the flattened state space. While this prevents us from solving large
problems, it also keeps the analysis of EM separate from
that of approximate inference. To verify our algorithms’
correctness, we used the drug effect network from Example 4.3, where all of the variables were binary-valued, for
tractability. We sampled increasing numbers of trajectories of 5 time lengths. We ran both EM and SEM, giving
the former the true network structure and hiding the structure from the latter. For each data example, we hid parts
of the trajectory by selecting time windows of length 0.25
uniformly at random and hiding the value of one variable
during the window. We kept dropping data in this fashion
until all variables had lost either 1/4 or 1/2 of their total trajectory, depending on the experiment. The results of these
experiments are shown in Figure 3(a). In some cases SEM
outperforms EM because the true structure with learned pa-

rameters yields a lower log-likelihood given the amount of
data at those points. Note that the horizontal axis represents
the amount of data prior to dropping any of it.
The SEM algorithm worked well in this setting. As noted,
removing the restriction on acyclicity allows CTBN structure search to decompose. Therefore, at each iteration, we
performed a full structure search, which provided marked
improvement over a greedy one-step optimization.
We also ran SEM on the British Household Panel Survey
(ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social Change, 2003).
This data is collectedyearly asking thousands of residents
of Britain about important events in their lives.We randomly divided this set into 4000 training examples and
4000 testing examples (each example is a trajectory of a
different person). Because we are employing exact inference, we had to keep the variable set small and chose 4 variables: employ (ternary: student, employed, unemployed),
married (binary: not married, married), children (ternary:
0, 1, 2+), and smoking (binary: non-smoker, smoker). The
average number of events per person is 5.6.
We learned structures and parameters for a time-sliced
DBN with a time-slice width of 1 year, a standard CTBN,
and a CTBN with 2 phases for every state of every variable. No restrictions were placed on the structure of these
2 phases (so, in general, they form a loop). In order to
compare CTBNs to DBNs, we sampled the testing data at
the same yearly rate and calculated the probability of these
sampled trajectories.The results are shown in Figure 3(b).
The DBN and plain CTBN models are comparable, with
the DBN doing better with more data due to its increased
flexibility (due to intra-time slice arcs, DBNs have more
potential parameters). However, the phase distributions increase the performance of the CTBN model; the trajectories are approximately twice as likely as with the other two
models. Figure 3(c) shows a learned exponential CTBN
network. The parameters are interesting. For example, the
rate (intensity) with which a person stops smoking given
that they have two or more children is three times the rate at
which a childless person quits smoking. The rate at which
a person begins smoking given that they have no children

is 300 times the rate of a person with two or more children.
The rate at which a person becomes unemployed (after having been employed) tends to decrease with more children
(unless the person does not smoke and is not married). The
rate of becoming unemployed also tends to be less if one
smokes (unless one is married and has a child).

7 Discussion
In this paper, we provided an algorithm for learning both
structure and parameters of CTBNs from partially observed
data. Given the scarcity of fully-observed data, particularly
in the continuous-time setting, we believe that this development is likely to greatly increase the applicability of the
CTBN framework to real-world problems.
Our experimental results were limited due to the reliance
on exact inference. To scale up to larger problems, approximate inference algorithms must be employed. Our companion paper (Nodelman et al., 2005) pursues this topic.
This paper addresses one of the primary limitations of
both CTBN and DBN models. Both models essentially assume an exponential (or geometric) model for state transitions. Although reasonable in some cases, an exponential
model is a poor fit for many real-life domains (such as the
interval between getting married and having children). Indeed, our experimental results show that CTBNs parameterized with the richer class of phase distributions significantly outperform both CTBNs and DBNs on a real-world
domain. An important extension is to investigate the applicability of different phase distribution transition models,
and to construct efficient algorithms for selecting an appropriate transition model automatically.
More globally, it would be interesting to apply phasedistribution CTBNs in other domains, and see whether this
rich class of continuous-time models achieves improved
performance over discrete-time models more broadly. In
particular, many systems do not have a single natural time
granularity; for example, in traffic modeling, locations of
vehicles evolve more rapidly than driver intention, which
evolves more quickly than the weather. Although one can
learn discrete-time models that use the finest level of granularity, the geometric duration distribution of such models
(which is particularly marked in fine-grained time models)
can be a poor fit to the true duration distribution. Conversely, using an overly coarse granularity can also lead to
artifacts in the learned model (Nodelman et al., 2003). We
believe that the modeling flexibility resulting from continuous time models, augmented with the efficient structure
learning made possible in CTBNs, will allow us to better
tackle multiple applications, ranging from modeling people’s activity to learning evolutionary models of DNA sequences.
