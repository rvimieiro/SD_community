can not distinguish Markov equivalent graphs by
knowledge about independence relations alone. In
the process of learning graphical structures from
data, it may have advantage to search over Markov
equivalence classes instead of the individual graphs
[Chickering, 2002a, Chickering, 2002b]. To interpret
a learned model it is essential to know the features
common to all graphs in an equivalence class.
The characterization of Markov equivalence classes
for DAGs were given in [Verma and Pearl, 1990,
Meek, 1995, Andersson et al., 1997]. A full characterization for equivalence classes of MAGs are still unavailable. [Ali and Richardson, 2002] sought to characterize those edges that are common to every graph
in an equivalence class of MAGs. Graphical conditions
for two MAGs being Markov equivalent were given in
[Spirtes and Richardson, 1996, Ali et al., 2004].
A transformational characterization of Markov equivalent DAGs was given in [Chickering, 1995], which gave
rules for transforming a DAG into a Markov equivalent DAG by edge reversing (replace X → Y by
X ← Y ) and showed that, for any two Markov equivalent DAGs, there exists a sequence of such arrow reversals that takes one DAG into the other. In this paper
we seek a transformational characterization of Markov
equivalence for MAGs without undirected edges.1 We
provide conditions under which a directed edge can
be reversed, or interchanged with a bi-directed edge,
to generate a Markov equivalent MAG. However, we
were unable to decide whether any two Markov equiva1

Two Markov equivalent MAGs containing undirected
edges may not be transformed to each other by single edge
replacement (see Section 2).

lent MAGs can be transformed into each other through
such single edge replacement.
Chickering’s transformational characterization for
DAGs has had important applications. We expect that
a transformational characterization of Markov equivalent MAGs will have similar applications in DAG models with latent variables. For example, it might be
useful for identifying those edges which are present in
every MAG in an equivalence class; it may facilitate a
score-based structure learning algorithm that searches
on the space of Markov equivalence classes of MAGs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 clarifies the reason why we only consider MAGs
without undirected edges. Section 3 introduces MAGs
and provides basic notation, definitions, and theorems.
Section 4 contains the main result of the paper, with
all the proofs given in the Appendix.

Undirected Edges in a MAG

In a general MAG, undirected edges are used to represent the presence of selection variables, that is, variables that are conditioned upon. The definition of a
MAG leads to that the configurations X — Y ↔ Z
and X — Y ← Z do not occur, and therefore any
MAG can be split into an undirected graph Gu and
a MAG containing no undirected edges Ga such that
any edge between a node X in Gu and a node Y in Ga
takes the form X → Y [Richardson and Spirtes, 2002].
In general, two Markov equivalent MAGs containing
undirected edges may not be transformed to each other
by single edge replacement. For example, the two
MAGs in Figure 1 are Markov equivalent, however any
single replacement of an undirected edge by a directed
edge in Figure 1(a) will lead to a graph that is not
a MAG. For this reason, in this paper, we will only
consider MAGs without undirected edges. The results
will be useful in models containing latent variables but
no selection variables.

Notation, Definitions, and
Theorems

We have mostly adopted the notation and definitions
in [Ali and Richardson, 2002]. If there is an edge between X and Y , then X is adjacent to Y . If X → Y ,
then X is a parent of Y and Y is a child of X. If
X ↔ Y , then X is a spouse of Y . A directed path
from X to Y is a path composed of directed edges
(X → . . . → Y ). If there is a directed path from X to
Y or X = Y , then X is an ancestor of Y . A node Z
on a path is called a collider if two arrowheads on the
path meet at Z, i.e. X → Z ← Y, X ↔ Z ↔ Y ,
X ↔ Z ← Y , or X → Z ↔ Y ; all other nonendpoint nodes on a path are called non-colliders, i.e.
X ← Z → Y, X ← Z ← Y, X → Z → Y, X ↔ Z → Y ,
or X ← Z ↔ Y . A collider (non-collider) is said to
be unshielded if X and Y above are not adjacent, and
shielded otherwise.
Ancestral graphs have at most one edge between each
pair of nodes, and in this paper we consider ancestral
graphs without undirected edges.
Definition 1 (ancestral graph) A graph which
may contain directed (→) or bi-directed edges (↔) is
ancestral if
1. there are no directed cycles;
2. whenever there is an edge X ↔ Y , then there is
no directed path from X to Y , or from Y to X.
Pearl’s d-separation criterion can be naturally extended to be applied in ancestral graphs, and are called
m-separation whose formal definition is given below.
Definition 2 (m-separation) A path between nodes
X and Y in an ancestral graph is said to be mconnecting given a set Z if
1. every non-collider on the path is not in Z, and
2. every collider on the path is an ancestor of a node
in Z.
If there is no path m-connecting X and Y given Z,
then X and Y are said to be m-separated given Z.
Two Sets V and W are said to be m-separated given
Z, if for every pair X, Y , with X ∈ V and Y ∈ W , X
and Y are m-separated given Z.
M-separation characterizes the independence relations
represented by an ancestral graph.
Definition 3 (Markov equivalent) Two graphs G1
and G2 are said to be Markov equivalent if for all disjoint sets A, B, Z, A and B are m-separated given Z

in G1 if and only if A and B are m-separated given Z
in G2 .

3. Z is adjacent to Y on p, X is not adjacent to Y ,
and

In a DAG, two nodes are m-separable by some set of
variables if and only if they are not adjacent. It is no
longer the case in an ancestral graph. It is possible
that two non-adjacent nodes are not m-separable by
any set of variables. Since we are only concerned with
independence relations, we may add an edge between
non-adjacent but unseparable nodes, which motivates
the following definition.

4. for every node Q between X and Z on p except
for the endpoints, Q is a collider on p and there
is an edge Q → Y in G.
Theorem 2 [Spirtes and Richardson, 1996]
Two
MAGs M1 and M2 are Markov equivalent if and only
if
1. they have the same adjacencies;

Definition 4 (maximal ancestral graph (MAG))
An ancestral graph is said to be maximal if, for every
pair of non-adjacent nodes X, Y there exists a set Z
such that X and Y are m-separated conditional on Z.
Every non-maximal ancestral graph corresponds to a
MAG, so we will restrict our attention to MAGs in the
rest of the paper.
The conditions for unseparability are characterized by
the notion of inducing path [Verma and Pearl, 1990].
Definition 5 (inducing path) A path between two
nodes X and Y is an inducing path if and only if every
internal node in the path is a collider on the path and
is an ancestor of X or Y or both.
The following theorem gives conditions for an arbitrary
graph (singly connected with bidirected edges) to be
a MAG.
Theorem 1 [Spirtes et al., 1997] A graph M is a
MAG if and only if:
1. If there is an inducing path between X and Y in
M , then X and Y are adjacent in M .
2. If there is an edge X −→ Y in M , then Y is not
an ancestor of X in M .
3. If there is an edge X ←→ Y in M , then X is not
an ancestor of Y and Y is not an ancestor of X
in M .
The conditions for two MAGs to be Markov equivalent are characterized by the following definition and
theorem.
Definition 6 (discriminating path) In an ancestral graph G, a path p between nodes X and Y is a
discriminating path for node Z if and only if
1. p contains Z, Z 6= X, Z 6= Y ,
2. p has at least three edges,

2. they have the same set of unshielded colliders; and
3. if p is a discriminating path for X in M1 and the
corresponding path p0 in M2 is a discriminating
path for X, then X is a collider on p in M1 if
and only if X is a collider on p0 in M2 .
[Ali et al., 2004] gives another (stronger) criterion for
two MAGs being Markov equivalent. However, our
results in this paper are based on Theorem 2.

Generating Markov Equivalent
MAGs

[Chickering, 1995] gave conditions for edge reversals in
a DAG to generate a Markov equivalent DAG. In this
section we give conditions for single edge replacement
in a MAG to generate a Markov equivalent MAG based
on Theorem 2. Proofs of theorems are given in the
Appendix.
Definition 7 (blanketed edge) An edge X −→ Y
is a blanketed edge in a MAG if
1. there is no directed path from X to Y (other than
X −→ Y itself ),
2. all parents of X are parents of Y , and
3. for each X’s spouse Z, either Z is a spouse of
Y , or Z is a parent of Y and there is no discriminating path for X that contains the path
Z ←→ X −→ Y .
An edge X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge against X in a
MAG if the above conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied.2
Note that whether an edge is a blanketed edge can
be determined efficiently as for a fixed triplet X, Y, Z
in the above condition 3, whether there is a discriminating path can be determined in time linear in the
number of edges in the MAG.
2
Condition 1 is always satisfied in a MAG containing
X ←→ Y .

The following theorem gives conditions for exchanging
a directed edge with a bi-directed edge in a MAG.

A1 ..... ..... ..... .................. Ak−1.............
.

Theorem 3 1. Let M be a MAG with the edge
X −→ Y , and let M 0 be a MAG with the edge
X ←→ Y otherwise identical to M . If M 0 is
Markov equivalent to M , then X −→ Y is a blanketed edge in M and X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge
against X in M 0 .
2. If X −→ Y is a blanketed edge in a MAG M ,
replacing it by X ←→ Y will result in a MAG
and the MAG is Markov equivalent to M .
3. If X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge against X in a
MAG M , replacing it by X −→ Y will result in a
MAG and the MAG is Markov equivalent to M .
We use P a(X) to denote the set of parents of X and
Sp(X) to denote the set of spouses of X.
Definition 8 (screened edge) An edge X −→ Y is
a screened edge in a MAG if P a(Y ) = P a(X) ∪ {X}
and Sp(Y ) = Sp(X).
The following theorem gives conditions for reversing a
directed edge in a MAG.
Theorem 4 Let M be a MAG with the edge X −→ Y ,
and let M 0 be a graph with the edge X ←− Y otherwise
identical to M . Then M 0 is a MAG that is Markov
equivalent to M if and only if X −→ Y is a screened
edge in M .
[Chickering, 1995] showed that for two Markov equivalent DAGs there always exists a sequence of edge reversals that will transform one DAG into the other. In
order to prove a similar property in MAGs, we need
to show the following. For two MAGs M and M 0 with
the same set of nodes and the same adjacencies, we
use ∆(M, M 0 ) to represent the set of edges in M that
are different in M 0 .
Conjecture 1 If two MAGs M and M 0 are Markov
equivalent, then there exists an edge in ∆(M, M 0 ) that
is blanketed or blanketed against some node.
If the conjecture holds, then M can be transformed
to M 0 by a sequence of adding/removing arrowheads.
Currently we are unable to prove or refute this conjecture.
With Theorems 3 and 4, given a MAG M , we can
generate a set of MAGs that are Markov equivalent
to M by repeated single edge replacement. Whether
all the equivalent MAGs can be generated this way
depends on the trueness of Conjecture 1.

Conclusion

We give conditions under which a single edge replacement in a MAG leads to a Markov equivalent MAG.
The result can be used to generate equivalent MAGs
starting from a given MAG. Whether all the equivalent MAGs can be generated this way remains an
open problem. The result is one step toward the goal
of a full transformational characterization of Markov
equivalent MAGs.

Appendix
A path p between two nodes X and Y may be denoted
by p = (X, . . . , Z, . . . , Y ) where Z is a node on p. A
subpath of p between two nodes W and Z on p will be
denoted by p(W, Z).
Lemma 1 Let X −→ Y (or X ←→ Y ) be a blanketed
edge (against X) in a MAG M . If there is a path
p = (A1 , . . . , Ak , X) between A1 and X such that every
internal node is a collider on p and Ak is a spouse of
X, then for i = 1, . . . , k either there exists a node Ai
being a spouse of Y or every node Ai is a parent of Y .
Proof: Assume none of Ai is a spouse of Y . Since
Ak is a spouse of X, Ak must be a parent of Y from
the definition of a blanketed edge. Ak−1 must be adjacent to Y else the path (Ak−1 , Ak , X, Y ) would be
a discriminating path for X (see Figure 2(a)). Ak−1
cannot be a child of Y else (Ak , Y, Ak−1 ) is a directed
path from Ak to Ak−1 which contradicts to the fact
that M is a MAG (see Figure 2(b)). Thus if Ak−1 is
not a spouse of Y it must be a parent of Y . With the
same arguments we can show Ai , i = 1, . . . , k, must
all be parents of Y .

Figure 3: Theorem 3-1
Theorem 3 1. Let M be a MAG with the edge
X −→ Y , and let M 0 be a MAG with the edge
X ←→ Y otherwise identical to M . If M 0 is
Markov equivalent to M , then X −→ Y is a blanketed edge in M and X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge
against X in M 0 .
2. If X −→ Y is a blanketed edge in a MAG M ,
replacing it by X ←→ Y will result in a MAG
and the MAG is Markov equivalent to M .
3. If X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge against X in a
MAG M , replacing it by X −→ Y will result in a
MAG and the MAG is Markov equivalent to M .
Proof:
1. Since M 0 contains the edge X ←→ Y , from the
definition of a MAG there is no directed path from
X to Y . If Z is a parent of X, then Z must
be adjacent to Y , else there will be a unshielded
collider in M 0 but not in M (see Figure 3(a)).
From the definition of a MAG, the edge between
Z and Y can only be Z −→ Y . If Z is a spouse of
X then Z must be adjacent to Y else there will be
a unshielded collider in M 0 which is not in M . Z
cannot be a child of Y else (X, Y, Z) is a directed
path from X to Z in M which contradicts the fact
that M is a MAG (see Figure 3(b)). Z can be a
spouse of Y . If Z is a parent of Y , then there
is no discriminating path for X that contains the
path Z ←→ X −→ Y in M , else the same path
would be a discriminating path for X in M 0 which
contradicts the fact that M and M 0 are Markov
equivalent (see Figure 3(c)).
2. Let M 0 be the graph resulted from replacing
X −→ Y by X ←→ Y in M . First we show that

M 0 is a MAG. First of all, since X −→ Y is a blanketed edge there is no directed path from X to Y
or from Y to X. Replacing X −→ Y by X ←→ Y
will not create a new directed path. We need to
show that the edge X ←→ Y will not create an
inducing path (with non-adjacent endpoints). Assume that replacing X −→ Y by X ←→ Y leads
to an inducing path p between two nodes A and
B. p must contain X ←→ Y in M 0 else p would already be an inducing path in M (see Figure 4(a)).
Each internal node on p between A and X is a collider, thus by Lemma 1 either there exists a node
being a spouse of Y or every node from A to Z is
a parent of Y . If a node W is a spouse of Y , then
the path (p(A, W ), W, Y, p(Y, B)) will already be
an inducing path in M (see Figure 4(b)). If none
of the internal node between A and X is a spouse
of Y , then A is a parent or spouse of Y , but then
the path (A, Y, p(Y, B)) will already be an inducing path in M .
Next we show that M 0 is Markov equivalent to M .
First, M 0 has the same adjacencies as M . Second,
if M 0 has an unshielded collider that is not in
M , the unshielded collider must involve the edge
X ←→ Y and X’s parents or spouses. However
all X’s parents and spouses are adjacent to Y .
Finally if Z is a parent or spouse of X there is no
discriminating path for X that contains the path
(Z, X, Y ) in M 0 from the definition of a blanketed
edge.
3. If X ←→ Y is a blanketed edge against X in
a MAG M , let M 0 be the graph with the edge
X −→ Y otherwise identical to M . First we show
that M 0 is a MAG. M 0 cannot have a cycle since
there is no directed path from Y to X in M from
the definition of a MAG. The operation of changing edge X ←→ Y to X −→ Y may make M 0
not a MAG in two situations: (1) the operation
creates a directed path between two nodes connected by a bi-directed edge (Figure 5(a)); (2)
the operation creates an inducing path between
two nonadjacent nodes (Figure 5(b)). In both
Figure 5 (a) and (b) A is not an ancestor of B

in M but will be an ancestor of B in M 0 . If A
does not coincide with X, then since a parent of
X is a parent of Y from the definition of a blanketed edge, A will already be an ancestor of B in
M . Thus we only need to consider the cases of
X = A which are shown in Figure 5(c) and (d).
In Figure 5(c), B is a spouse of X. From the definition of a blanketed edge B either is a spouse
of Y or a parent of Y . However, since there is a
directed path from Y to B, from the definition of
a MAG B can neither be a parent nor a spouse of
Y . Thus this case cannot happen. In Figure 5(d),
let p denote the inducing path between C and B.
Each node between X and B is a collider on p,
thus by Lemma 1 either one node between X and
B (including B) is a spouse of Y or all of them are
parents of Y . However B can neither be a parent
nor a spouse of Y since there is a directed path
from Y to B. Therefore one internal node on path
p(X, B) must be a spouse of Y , say node E. Again
by Lemma 1, either one internal node (say F ) on
path p(X, C) is a spouse of Y (see Figure 5(e))
or C is a parent or spouse of Y (see Figure 5(f)).
In Figure 5(e) the path (p(C, F ), F, Y, E, p(E, B))
will be an inducing path in M . In Figure 5(f) the
path (C, Y, E, p(E, B)) will be an inducing path
in M .
Next we show that M 0 is Markov equivalent to
M . First, M 0 has the same adjacencies as M .
Second, if M has an unshielded collider not in
M 0 , the unshielded collider must involve the edge
X ←→ Y and X’s parents or spouses. However
all X’s parents and spouses are adjacent to Y .
Finally for all Z which is a parent or spouse of X
there is no discriminating path for X in M that
contains the path (Z, X, Y ) from the definition of
a blanketed edge.

Lemma 2 If X −→ Y is a screened edge in a MAG
M , then it is a blanketed edge in M .
Proof: We only need to show that there is no directed
path from X to Y . If there is a directed path from X
to Y in M , let Z be the node nearest to Y in the path
(see Figure 6). Z is a parent of Y thus Z must be a
parent of X from the definition of a screened edge.
Then there would be a cycle in M (see Figure 6). 2
Theorem 4 Let M be a MAG with the edge X −→ Y ,
and let M 0 be a graph with the edge X ←− Y otherwise
identical to M . Then M 0 is a MAG that is Markov
equivalent to M if and only if X −→ Y is a screened
edge in M .

Proof:
(only if ) Let Z be a parent of X. Z must be adjacent
to Y else there is a unshielded collider in M 0 which
is not in M (see Figure 7(a)). The edge between Z
and Y must be Z −→ Y because M is a MAG. With
similar arguments, a parent of Y must be a parent of
X.
Let Z be a spouse of X. Z must be adjacent to Y
else there is a unshielded collider in M 0 which is not in
M (see Figure 7(b)). If the edge between Z and Y is
Z −→ Y (see Figure 7(c)), there will be a directed path
from Z to X in M 0 and M 0 will not be a MAG. If the
edge between Z and Y is Z ←− Y (see Figure 7(d)),
there will be a directed path from X to Z in M and
M will not be a MAG. Thus Z must be a spouse of
Y . With similar arguments, a spouse of Y must be a
spouse of X.
(if ) By Lemma 2, the edge X −→ Y is a blanketed
edge. Let M 00 be the graph resulted from replacing
X −→ Y with X ←→ Y in M . Then M 00 is a MAG
Markov equivalent to M by Theorem 3. X ←→ Y is
a blanketed edge against Y in M 00 from the definition
of a screened edge. Thus M 0 is a MAG Markov
equivalent to M 00 by Theorem 3. Therefore M 0 is a
MAG Markov equivalent to M .
