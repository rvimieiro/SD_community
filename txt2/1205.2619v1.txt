1 Introduction
Markov decision processes (MDPs) have proven to be an
extremely useful formalism for decision making in stochastic environments. However, the specification of an MDP
by a user or domain expert can be difficult, e.g., cognitively demanding, computationally costly, or time consuming. For this reason, much work has been devoted to learning the dynamics of stochastic systems from transition data,
both in offline [11] and online (i.e., reinforcement learning)
settings [19]. While model dynamics are often relatively
stable in many application domains, MDP reward functions are much more variable, reflecting the preferences and
goals of specific users in that domain. This makes reward
function specification more difficult: they can’t generally
be specified a priori, but must be elicited or otherwise assessed for individual users. Even online RL methods require the specification of a user’s reward function in some
form: unlike state transitions, it is impossible to directly
observe a reward function except in very specific settings
with simple, objectively definable, observable performance

In this paper, we tackle the problem of reward elicitation
in MDPs by treating it as a preference elicitation problem.
Recent research in preference elicitation for non-sequential
decision problems exploits the fact that optimal or nearoptimal decisions can often be made with relatively imprecise specification of a utility function [6, 8]. Interactive
elicitation and optimization techniques take advantage of
feasibility restrictions on actions or outcomes to focus their
elicitation efforts on only the most relevant aspects of a utility function. We adopt a similar perspective in the MDP
setting, demonstrating that optimal and near-optimal policies can be often found with limited reward information.
For instance, reward bounds in conjunction with MDP dynamics can render certain regions of state space provably
dominated by others (w.r.t. value).
We make two main contributions that allow effective elicitation of reward functions. First, we develop a novel robust
optimization technique for solving MDPs with imprecisely
specified rewards. Specifically, we adopt the minimax regret decision criterion [6, 18] and develop a formulation for
MDPs: intuitively, this determines a policy that has minimum regret, or loss w.r.t. the optimal policy, over all possible reward function realizations consistent with the cur-

rent partial reward specification. Unlike other work on robust optimization for imprecisely specified MDPs, which
focuses on the maximin decision criterion [1, 13, 14, 16],
minimax regret determines superior policies in the presence
of reward function uncertainty. We describe an exact computational technique for minimax regret and suggest several approximations. Second, we develop a simple elicitation procedure that exploits the information provided by the
minimax-regret solution to guide the querying process. In
this work, we focus on simple schemes that refine the upper
and lower bounds of specific reward values. We show that
good or optimal policies can be determined with very imprecise reward functions when elicitation effort is focused
in this way. Our work thus tackles the problem of reward
function precision directly. While we do not address the
issue of reward-value conflation in this model, we will discuss it further below.

2 Notation and Problem Formulation
We begin by reviewing MDPs and defining the minimax
regret criterion for MDPs with imprecise rewards.
2.1 Markov Decision Processes
Let hS, A, {Psa }, γ, α, ri be an infinite horizon MDP with:
finite state set S of size n; finite action set A of size k; transition distributions Psa (·), with Psa (t) denoting the probability of reaching state t when action a is taken at s; reward
function r(s, a); discount factor γ < 1; and initial state distribution α(·). Let r be the n × k-vector with entries r(s, a)
and P the n × k × n transition matrix. We use ra and Pa
to denote the obvious restrictions of these to action a. We
define E to be the nk × n-matrix with a row for each stateaction pair and one column per state, with Esa,t = Psa (t)
if t 6= s, and Esa,t = Psa (t) − 1 if t = s.
Our aim is to find an optimal policy that maximizes expected discounted reward. A deterministic policy π : S →
A has value function V π satisfying:
X
V π (s) = r(s, π(s)) + γ
Psπ(s) (s′ )V π (s′ )
s′

or equivalently (slightly abusing subscript π):
Vπ = raπ + γPaπ Vπ

(1)

We also define the Q-function Q : S × A → R as:
Qπa = ra + γPa Vπ ,
i.e., the value of executing π forward after taking action a.
A policy π induces a visitation frequency function f π ,
where f π (s, a) is the total discounted joint probability of being in state s and taking action a. The policy can readily
be recovered from f π , via π(s, a) =
P
π
π
π
=
f (s, a)/ a′ f (s, a′ ). (For deterministic policies, fsa

0 for all a other than π(s).) We use F to denote the set
of valid visitation frequency functions (w.r.t. a fixed MDP),
i.e., those satisfying [17]:
γE⊤ f + α = 0.

(2)

The optimal value function V ∗ satisfies:
αV∗ = r⊤ f ∗

(3)

where f ∗ = supf r⊤ f [17]. Thus, determining an optimal
policy is equivalent to finding optimal frequencies f ∗ .
2.2 Minimax Regret for Imprecise MDPs
A number of researchers have considered the problem of
solving imprecisely specified MDPs (see below). Here we
focus on the solution of MDPs with imprecise reward functions. Since fully specifying reward functions is difficult,
we will often be faced with the problem of computing policies with an incomplete reward specification. Indeed, as
we see below, we often explicitly wish to leave parts of a
reward function unelicited (or otherwise unassessed). Formally we assume that r ∈ R, where the feasible reward set
R reflects current knowledge of the reward. These could
reflect: prior bounds specified by a user or domain expert;
constraints that emerge from an elicitation process (as discussed below); or constraints that arise from observations
of user behavior (as in inverse RL [15]). In all of these
situations, we are unlikely to have full reward information.
Thus we require a criterion by which to compare policies
in an imprecise-reward MDP.
We adopt the minimax regret criterion, originally suggested
(though not endorsed) by Savage [18], and applied with
some success in non-sequential decision problems [6, 7].
Let R be the set of feasible reward functions. Minimax
regret can be defined in three stages:
R(f , r) = max

r·g−r·f

(4)

MR(f , R) = max

R(f , r)

(5)

MMR(R) = min

MR(f , R)

(6)

g∈F

r∈R

f ∈F

R(f , r) is the regret of policy f (as represented by its visitation frequencies) relative to reward function r: it is simply
the loss or difference in value between f and the optimal
policy under r. MR(f , R) is the maximum regret of f w.r.t.
feasible reward set R. Should we chose a policy with visitation frequencies f , MR(f , R) represents the worst-case
loss over all possible realizations of the reward function;
i.e., the regret incurred in the presence of an adversary who
chooses the r from R to maximize our loss. Finally, in
the presence of such an adversary, we wish to minimize
this max regret: MMR(R) is the minimax regret of feasible reward set R. This can be viewed as a game between a
decision maker choosing f who wants to minimize loss relative to the optimal policy, and an adversary who chooses
a reward to maximize this loss given the decision maker’s

446

REGAN & BOUTILIER

choice of policy. Any f ∗ that minimizes max regret is a
minimax optimal policy, while the r that maximizes its regret is the witness or adversarial reward function, and the
optimal policy g for r is the witness or adversarial policy.
Minimax regret has a variety of desirable properties relative
to other robust decision criteria [6]. Compared to Bayesian
methods that compute expected value using a prior over R
[3, 8], minimax regret provides worst-case bounds on loss.
Specifically, let f be the minimax regret optimal visitation
frequencies and let δ be the max regret achieved by f ; then,
given any instantiation of r, no policy will outperform f
by more than δ w.r.t. expected value. Minimax optimal decisions can often be computed more effectively than decisions that maximize expected value w.r.t. to some prior.
Finally, it has been shown to be a very effective criterion
for driving elicitation in one-shot problems [6, 7].
2.3 Robust Optimization for Imprecise MDPs
Most work on robust optimization for imprecisely specified MDPs adopts the maximin criterion, producing policies with maximum security level or worst-case value
[1, 13, 14, 16]. Restricting attention to imprecise rewards,
the maximin value is given by:

UAI 2009

intuitive measure of performance by assessing the policy
ex post and making comparisons only w.r.t. specific reward
realizations. Thus, policy π is penalized on reward r only
if there exists a π ′ that has higher value w.r.t. r itself.

3 Minimax Regret Computation
As discussed above, maximin is amenable to dynamic programming since it can be decomposed over decision stages.
This decomposition does not appear tenable for minimax
regret since it grants the adversary too much power by
allowing rewards to be set independently at each stage
(though see our discussion of future work below). Following the formulations for non-sequential problems developed in [6, 7], we instead formulate the optimization using
a series of linear (LPs) and mixed integer programs (MIPs)
that enforce a consistent choice of reward across time.
Assume feasible reward set R is represented by a convex
polytope Cr ≤ d, which we assume to be bounded. The
constraints on r arise as discussed above (prior bounds,
elicitation, or behavioral observation). Minimax regret can
then be expressed as following minimax program:
min

max max
g

f

MMN(R) = max min
f ∈F r∈R

r·f

(7)

Most models are defined for uncertainty in any MDP parameters, but algorithmic work has focused on uncertainty
in the transition function, and the of eliciting information
about transition functions or rewards is left unaddressed.
Robust policies can be computed for uncertain transition
functions using the maximin criterion by decomposing the
problem across time-steps and using dynamic programming and an efficient suboptimization to find the worst case
transition function [1, 13, 16]. McMahan, Gordon, and
Blum [14] develop a linear programming approach to efficiently compute the maximin value of an MDP (we empirically compare this approach to ours below). Delage
and Mannor [9] address the problem of uncertainty over reward functions (and transition functions) in the presence of
prior information, using a percentile criterion, which can
be somewhat less pessimistic than maximin. They also
contribute a method for eliciting rewards using sampling to
approximate the expected value of information of noisy information about a point in reward space. The percentile approach is neither fully Bayesian nor does it offer a bound on
performance. Zhang and Parkes ([20]) also adopt maximin
in a model that assumes an inverse reinforcement learning
setting for policy teaching. The approach is essentially a
form of reward elicitation which the queries are changes to
a student’s reward, and information is gained by observing
change in the student’s behavior.
Generally, the maximin criterion leads to conservative policies by optimizing against the worst possible instantiation
of r (as we will see below). Minimax regret offers a more

This is equivalent to a minimization:

∀ g ∈ F, r ∈ R

⊤

γE f + α = 0

This corresponds to the standard dual LP formulation of
an MDP with the addition of adversarial policy constraints.
The infinite number of constraints can be reduced: first we
need only retain as potentially active those constraints for
vertices of polytope R; and for any r ∈ R, we only require
the constraint corresponding to its optimal policy gr∗ . However, vertex enumeration is not feasible; so we apply Benders’ decomposition [2] to iteratively generate constraints.
At each iteration, two optimizations are solved. The master
problem solves a relaxation of program (8) using only a
small subset of the constraints, corresponding to a subset
Gen of all hg, ri pairs; we call these generated constraints.
Initially, this set is arbitrary (e.g., empty). Intuitively, in
the game against the adversary, this restricts the adversary
to choosing witnesses (i.e., hg, ri pairs) from Gen.
Let f be the solution to the current master problem and
MMR′ (R) its objective value (i.e., minimax regret in the
presence of the restricted adversary). The subproblem generates the maximally violated constraint relative to f . In
other words, we compute MR(f , R); its solution determines the witness points hg, ri by removing restrictions

UAI 2009

on the adversary. If MR(f , R) = MMR′ (R) then the constraint for hg, ri is satisfied at the current solution, and indeed all unexpressed constraints must be satisfied as well.
The process then terminates with minimax optimal solution f . Otherwise, MR(f , R) > MMR′ (R), implying that
the constraint for hg, ri is violated in the current relaxation
(indeed, it is the maximally violated such constraint). So it
is added to Gen and the process repeats.
Computation of MR(f , R) is realized by the following MIP,
using value and Q-functions:1

the optimal policy with respect to the best setting of each
⊥
individual reward point and M⊥
a to be the Q-value Qa of
the optimal policy with respect to the worst point-wise setting of rewards (the resulting rewards need not be feasible).
The subproblem does not directly produce a witness pair
hgi , ri i for the master constraint set; instead it provides ri
and Vi . However, we do not need access to gi directly; the
constraint can be posted using the reward function ri and
the value α · Vi , since α · Vi = ri · gi (and gi is required to
determine this adversarial value in the posted constraint).
In practice we have found that the iterative constraint generation converges quickly, with relatively few constraints
required to determine minimax regret (see Sec. 5). However, the computational cost per iteration can be quite high.
This is due exclusively to the subproblem optimization,
which requires the solution of a MIP with a large number
of integer variables, one per state-action pair. The master
problem optimization, by contrast, is extremely effective
(since it is basically a standard MDP linear program). This
suggests examination of approximations to the subproblem,
i.e., the computation of max regret MR(f , R). This is also
motivated by our focus on reward elicitation. We wish to
use minimax regret to drive query selection: our aim is not

Specifying max regret in terms of visitation frequencies (i.e.,
the standard dual MDP formulation) gives rise to a non-convex
quadratic program. Regret maximization does not lend itself to a
natural, linear primal formulation.

447

to compute minimax regret for its own sake, but to determine which state-action pairs should be queried, i.e., which
have the potential to reduce minimax regret. The visitation
frequencies used by our heuristics need not correspond to
exact minimax optimal policy.
We have explored several promising alternatives, including
an alternating optimization model that computes an adversarial policy (for a fixed reward) and an adversarial reward
(for a fixed policy). This reduces the quadratic optimization
for max regret to a sequence of LPs. An simpler approximation is explored here (which performs as well in practice): we solve the LP relaxation of the MIP by removing
the integrality constraints (13) on the binary policy indicators. The value function V resulting from this relaxation
does not accurately reflect the (now stochastic) adversarial
policy: V may include a fraction of the big-M term due to
constraint (10). However, the reward function r selected
remains in the feasible set, and, empirically, the optimal
value function for r yields a solution to the subproblem
that is close to optimal.2 Since the reward is valid choice,
this solution is guaranteed to be a lower bound on the solution to the subproblem. When this approximate subproblem solution is used in constraint generation, convergence
is no longer guaranteed; however, the solution to the master
problem represents a valid lower bound on minimax regret.

4 Reward Elicitation
Reward elicitation and assessment can proceed in a variety of ways. Many different query forms can be adopted
for user interaction. Similarly, observed user behavior can
be used to induce constraints on the reward function under
assumptions of user “optimality” [15]. In this work, we focus on simple bound queries, though our strategies can be
adapted to more general query types. We discuss some of
these below.3
We assume that R is given by upper and lower bounds on
r(s, a) for each state-action pair. A bound query takes the
form “Is r(s, a) ≥ b?” where b lies between the upper
and lower bound on r(s, a). While this appears to require a
direct, quantitative assessment of value/reward by the user,
it can be recast as a standard gamble [10], a device used
in decision analysis to reduce this to preference query over
two outcomes (one of which is stochastic). For simplicity,
we express it in this bound form. Unlike reward queries [9],
which require a direct assessment of r(s, a), bound queries
require only a yes-no response and are less cognitively demanding. A response tightens either the upper or lower
2

Finding the optimal value function for r requires solving a
standard MDP LP.
3
We allow reward queries about any state-action pair, in contrast to online RL formalisms, in which information can be
gleaned only about the reward (and dynamics) at the current state.
As such, we face no exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

The second selection heuristic is the current solution (CS)
strategy, and uses the visitation frequencies from the minimax optimal solution f or the adversarial witness g to
weight each gap. Intuitively, if a query involves a reward
parameter that influences the value of neither f nor g, minimax regret will not be reduced, and visitation frequencies
quantify the degree of influence. Formally CS selects the
point:
argmax max{f (s∗ , a∗ )∆(s∗ , a∗ ), g(s∗ , a∗ )∆(s∗ , a∗ )}.
a∗ ∈A,s∗ ∈S

Given the selected (s∗ , a∗ ), bound b in the query is set
to the midpoint of the interval for r(s∗ , a∗ ). Thus either
response will reduce the interval by half. It is easy to apply
CS to the maximin criterion as well, using the visitation
frequencies associated with the maximin policy.

5 Experiments
We assess the general performance of our approach using a
set of randomly generated MDPs and specific MDPs arising in an autonomic computing setting. We assess scalability of our procedures, as well as the effectiveness of
minimax regret as a driver of elicitation.
We first consider randomly generated MDPs. We impose
structure on the MDP by creating a semi-sparse transition
function: for each (s, a)-pair, ⌈log n⌉ reachable states are
drawn uniformly and a Gaussian is used to generate transition probabilities. We use a uniform initial state distribution α and discount factor γ = 0.95. The true reward

Indifference (e.g., “I’m not sure”) can also be handled by constraining bounds to be within ε of the query point.

Reward Gap

Bound queries offer a natural starting point for the investigation of reward elicitation. Of course, many alternative
query modes can be used, with the sequential nature of the
MDP setting opening up choices that don’t exist in oneshot settings. These include the direct comparison of policies; comparison of (full or partial) state-action trajectories
or distributions over trajectories; and comparisons of outcomes in factored reward models. Trajectory comparisons
can be facilitated by using counts of relevant (or rewardbearing) events as dictated by a factored reward model for
example. These query forms should prove useful and even
more cognitively penetrable. However, the principles and
heuristics espoused below can be adapted to these settings.
There are many ways to select the point (s, a) at which to
ask a bound query. We explore some simple myopic heuristic criteria that are very easy to compute, are based on criteria suggested in [6]. The first selection heuristic is called
halve largest gap (HLG), which selects the point (s, a) with
the largest gap between its upper and lower bound. Formally, we define the gap ∆(s, a) and largest gap by:

w.r.t. this true (but unknown) reward is created by bounding each (s, a)-pair independently with bounds drawn randomly: thus the set of feasible rewards forms a hyperrectangle. 5
5.1 Computational Efficiency
To measure the performance of minimax regret computation, we first examine the constraint generation procedure.
Fig. 1 plots the regret gap between the master problem
value and subproblem value at each iteration versus the
time (in ms.) to reach that iteration. Results are shown for
20 randomly generated MDPs with ten states and five actions. Fig. 2 shows how minimax regret computation time
increases with the size of the MDP (5 actions, varying number of states). Constraint generation using the MIP formulation scales super-linearly, hence computing minimax regret exactly is only feasible for small MDPs using this formulation; by comparison the linear relaxation is far more
efficient.6 On the other hand, minimax regret computation
has very favorable anytime behavior, as exhibited in Fig. 1.
During constraint generation, the regret gap shrinks very
quickly early on. If exact minimax regret is not needed,
this property allows for fast approximation.
5.2 Approximation Error
To evaluate the linear relaxation scheme for max regret,
we generated random MDPs, varying the number of states.
Fig. 3 shows average relative error over 100 runs. The approximation performs well and, encouragingly, error does
not increase with the size of the MDP. We also evaluate its
impact on minimax regret when used to generate violated
constraints. Fig. 3 also shows relative error for minimax
regret to be small, well under 10% on average.

Of note, the computations shown here are using the initial reward uncertainty. As queries refine the reward polytope, regret
computation becomes faster in general. This has positive impli-

5.3 Elicitation Effectiveness
We analyzed the effectiveness of our regret-based elicitation procedure by comparing it with the maximin criterion.
We implemented a variation of the Double Oracle maximin
algorithm developed by McMahan, Gordon & Blum [14].
The computation time for maximin is significantly less the
that of minimax regret—this is expected since maximin requires only the solution of a pair of linear programs.
We use both maximin and minimax regret to compute policies at each step of preference elicitation, and paired each
with the current solution (CS) and halve largest gap (HLG)
query strategies, giving four elicitation procedures: MMRHLG (policies are computed using regret, queries generated by HLG); MMR-CS (regret policies, CS queries);
MM-HLG (maximin policies, HLG queries); and MM-CS
(maximin policies, CS queries). We assess each procedure by measuring the quality of the policies produced after each query, using the following metrics: (a) its maximin
value given the current (remaining) reward uncertainty; (b)
its max regret given the current (remaining) reward uncertainty; and (c) its true regret (i.e., loss w.r.t. the optimal policy for the true reward function r, where r is used to generate query responses). Minimax regret is the most critical
since it provides the strongest guarantees; but we compare
to maximin value as well, since maximin policies are optimizing against a very different robustness measure. True
cations for anytime computation.

regret is not available in practice; but it gives an indication
of how good the resulting policies actually are (as opposed
to a worst-case bound).
Fig. 4 show the results of the comparison on each measure. MMR-CS performs extremely well on all measures.
Somewhat surprisingly, it outperforms MM-CS and MMHLG w.r.t. maximin value (except at the very early stages).
Even though the maximin procedures are optimizing maximin value, MMR-CS asks much more informative queries,
allowing for a larger reduction in reward uncertainty at the
most relevant state-action pairs. This ability of MMR-CS to
identify the highest impact reward points becomes clearer
still when we examine how much reduction there is in reward intervals over the course of elicitation. Let χ measure
the sum of the length of the reward intervals. At the end
of elicitation, MMR-HLG reduces χ to 15.6% of its original value (averaged over the 20 MDPs), while MMR-CS
only reduces χ to 67.8 % of its original value. MMR-CS is
effectively eliminating regret while leaving a large amount
of uncertainty. Fig. 5 illustrates this using a histogram of
the number of queries asked by MMR-CS about each of
the 1000 possible state-action pairs.7 We see that MMRCS asks no queries about the majority of state-action pairs,
and asks quite a few queries (up to eight) about a small
number of “high impact” pairs.
Fig. 4(b) shows that MMR-CS is able to reduce regret to
zero (i.e., find an optimal policy) after less than 100 queries
on average. Recall that the MDP has 50 reward parameters
(state-action pairs), so on average, less than two queries
per parameter are required to find a provably optimal policy. The minimax regret policies also outperform the maximin policies by a wide margin with respect to true regret
(Fig. 4(c)). With the CS heuristic, a near-optimal policy is
found after fewer than 50 queries (less than one query per
parameter), though to prove that the policy is near-optimal
requires further queries (to reduce minimax regret).
It is worth noting that during preference elicitation, HLG
does not require that minimax regret actually be computed.

Figure 4: Reward elicitation with randomly generated MDPs.
Minimax regret is only necessary to assess when to stop the
elicitation process (i.e., to determine if minimax regret has
dropped to an acceptable level). One possible modification to reduce the time between queries is to only compute
minimax regret after every k queries. Of course, the HLG
strategy will lead to a slower reduction in true regret and
minimax regret as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c).
To further evaluate our approach we elicit the reward function for an autonomic computing scenario [4] in which we
must allocate computing or storage resources to application servers as their client demands change over time. We
assume k application server elements and N units of resource available to be assigned to the servers (plus a “zero
resource”). An allocation n = hn1 . . . nk i must satisfy
Pk
i ni < N . There are D demand levels at which each
server can operate, reflecting client demands. A demand
state d = hd1 . . . dk i specifies the current demand for each
server. A state of the MDP comprises the current resource
allocation and the current demand state: s = hn, di. Actions are new allocations m = hm1 . . . mk i of the N resources to the k servers. Reward r(n, d, m) = u(n, d) −
c(n, d, m) decomposes as follows. Utility u(n, d) is the
sum of server utilities ui (ni , di ). The MDP is initially
specified with strict uncertainty over the utilities ui however, we assume that each utility function ui is monotonic
non-decreasing in demand and resource level. The cost
c(n, d, m) is the sum of the costs of taking away one unit
of resource from each server at any stage. Uncertainty in
demand is exogenous and the action in the current state
uniquely determines the allocation in the next state. Thus
the transition function is composed of k Markov chains
Pr(d′i | di ), i ≤ k. Reward specification in this context
is inherently distributed and quite difficult: the local utility function ui for server i has no convenient closed form.
Server i can respond only to queries about the utility it gets
from a specific resource allocation level, and this requires
intensive optimization and simulation on the part of the
server [4]; hence minimizing the number of such queries
is critical.
We constructed a small instance of the autonomic computing scenario with 2 servers, 3 demand levels and 3 (indi-

visible) units of resource. The combined state space of
both servers includes 32 demand levels and 10 possible allocations of resources leading to 90 states and 10 actions.
We modeled the uncertainty over rewards using a hyperrectangle as with the random MDPs. We compared elicitation approaches as above, this time using the linear relaxation to compute minimax regret (each minimax computation takes under 3s.). Fig. 6 shows that MMR-CS again
outperforms the maximin criterion on each measure. Minimax regret and true regret fall to almost zero after 200
queries. Recall that the autonomic MDP had 900 stateaction pairs—the additional problem structure results in
fewer than 0.25 queries being asked for each state-action
pair. In fact, on average MMR-CS only asks about 106.5
distinct state-action pairs, only examining 12% of the reward space. By comparison, the queries chosen by the
MM-CS strategy cover just over 68% of the reward space.
As with random MDPs, minimax regret quickly reduces regret because it focuses queries on the “high impact” stateaction pairs.
Overall, our regret-based approach is quite appealing from
the perspective of reward elicitation. While the regret computation is more computationally intensive than other criteria, it provides arguably much more natural decisions in
the face of reward uncertainty. More importantly, from the
perspective of elicitation, it is much more attractive than
maximin w.r.t. the number of queries required to produce
high-quality policies. As long as interaction time (time between queries) remains reasonable, reducing user burden
(or other computational costs required to answer queries)
is our primary goal.

6 Conclusions & Future Work
We have developed an approach to reward elicitation in
MDPs that eases the burden of reward function elicitation.
Minimax regret not only offers robust policies in the face
of reward uncertainty, but we’ve shown it also allows one
to focus elicitation attention on the most important aspects
of the reward function. While the computational costs are
significant, it is an extremely effective driver of elicitation,

thus reducing the (more important) cognitive or computational cost of reward determination. Furthermore, it lends
itself to anytime approximation.
The somewhat preliminary nature of this work leaves many
interesting directions for future research. Perhaps most interesting is the development of more informative and intuitive queries that capture the sequential nature of the elicitation problem. Direct comparison of policies allows one to
distinguish value from reward, but are cognitively demanding. Trajectory comparison similar distinguishes value, but
may contain irrelevant detail. However, trajectory summaries (e.g., counts of relevant reward bearing events) may
be more perspicuous, and could be generated to reflect
expected “event counts” given a policy. Other forms of
queries should also prove valuable, but all exploit the basic idea embodied by minimax regret and the current solution heuristic. Another direction for improving elicitation
is to incorporate implicit information in a manner similar
to policy teaching [20]. Inverse RL [15] can be also used
to translate observed behavior into constraints on reward.
Some Bayesian models [6, 8] allow noisy query responses
and adding this to our regret model is another important
direction. Two approaches include: approximate indifference constraints and regret-based sensitivity analysis. The
efficiency of the minimax regret computation remains an
important research topic. We are exploring the use of dynamic programming to generate linear representations of
the best policies over all regions of reward space (much
like POMDPs) which can greatly assist max regret computation. We are also exploring techniques that exploit factored MDP structure using LP approaches [12].
