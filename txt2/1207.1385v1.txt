and summary.

2 PRELIMINARIES AND DEFINITIONS
A graphical model is defined by a collection of functions,
over a set of variables, conveying probabilistic or deterministic information, whose structure is captured by a graph.
D EFINITION 2.1 A graphical model is a triplet (X, D, F)
where 1. X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } is a finite set of variables, 2.
D = {D1 , . . . , Dn } is a set of domains of values in which Di
is a domain of Xi and 3. F = {F1 , F2 , . . . , Fm } is a set of
real-valued functions. The scope of functions fi denoted as
scope( fi ) ⊆ X, is the set of arguments of fi .

D EFINITION 2.2 The primal graph of a graphical model
is an undirected graph that has variables as its vertices
and an edge connects any two variables that appear in the
scope of the same function.
Two graphical models of interest in this paper are Hybrid Bayesian Networks and Constraint Networks. A Hybrid Bayesian Network (HBN) [Lauritzen, 1992] B =
(X, D, P) is defined over a directed acyclic graph G =
(X, E) and its functions Pi = {P(xi |pai )} where pai is
the set of parent nodes of xi . X is the set of variables
partitioned into
discrete ∆ and continuous Γ variables,
S
i.e. X = Γ ∆. The graph structure G is restricted in
that continuous variables cannot have discrete variables
as their child nodes. The conditional distribution of continuous variables are given by a linear Gaussian model:
P(xi |I = i, Z = z) = N(α(i) + β(i) ∗ z, γ(i)) xi ∈ Γ where
Z and I are the set of continuous and discrete parents of
xi respectively and N(µ, σ) is a multi-variate normal distribution. The network represents a joint distribution over
all its variables given by a product of all its CPDs. A
Constraint network [Dechter, 2003] R = (X, D,C), has
C = {C1 ,C2 , . . . ,Cm } as its functions also called as constraints. Each constraint Ci is a relation Ri defined over a
subset of the variables Si ⊆ X and denotes the combination
of values that can be assigned simultaneously. A Solution
is an assignment of values to all the variables such that no
constraint is violated. The primary query is to decide if the
Constraint Network is consistent (whether it has a solution)
and if so find one or all solutions.
Using
the
Mixed
Network
framework [Dechter and Mateescu, 2004] for augmenting
Bayesian Networks with constraints, we can extend HBNs
to include discrete constraints, yielding Hybrid Mixed
Networks (HMNs). Formally,
D EFINITION 2.3 (Hybrid Mixed Network) Given a HBN
B = (X, D, P) that expresses the joint probability PB and
given a Constraint Network R = (∆, D∆ ,C) that expresses
a set of solutions ρ, a Hybrid Mixed Network (HMN) based
on B and R denoted by M(B, R) is created from B and R
as follows. The discrete variables ∆ and their domains are
shared and the relationships include the CPDs in P and the
constraints in C. We assume that the Constraint Network
is always consistent and so the HMN expresses the conditional probability PM(X): PM (x) = PB (x|x ∈ ρ) i f x ∈ ρ
and 0 otherwise.
Example 2.1 Figure 1 shows a HBN and a Constraint Network yielding a HMN over variables {A,B,C,D,F,G} where
D and G are continuous variables (drawn as squares) and
the rest are discrete (drawn as circles).
D EFINITION 2.4 (Graph Decomposition) Given a graphical model (X, D, F), a graph decomposition is a triplet
(GD, χ, ψ) where GD(V, E) is a graph and χ and ψ are

Figure 1: Example HMN consisting of a HBN and a Constraint Network
labeling functions which associate with each vertex v ∈ V
two sets, χ(v) ⊆ X and ψ(v) ⊆ F such that, (1) For each
function fi ∈ F, there is exactly one vertex v ∈ V such
that fi ∈ ψ(v), and scope( fi ) ⊆ χ(v), (2) For each variable
xi ∈ X, the set of {v ∈ V |xi ∈ χ(v)} induces a connected
subgraph of G (called the running intersection property).
The width of a graph-decomposition is w = max|χ(v)| −
1. A join-tree-decomposition is a graph-decomposition in
which the graph is a tree while join-graph-decompositions
(JG(i)) are graph-decompositions in which the width is
bounded by i.
Example 2.2 Figure 2 showing (a) primal graph, (b) joingraph-decomposition and (c) join-tree-decomposition of
the example HMN shown in Figure 1.
Another relevant notion is that of w-cutset. Given a graphical model (X, D, F) , the w-cutset is the set of variables
X1 ⊆ X whose removal from the graphical model yields a
graphical model whose treewidth is bounded by w.
This paper focuses on the problem of computing the posterior marginal distribution (or beliefs) at each variable given
evidence i.e. P(xi |e). This problem is known to be NP-hard
and so we resort to approximations.

3 EXACT INFERENCE IN HMNs
In this section, we extend a class of exact inference algorithms based on join-tree-clustering [Lauritzen, 1992] from
HBNs to HMNs. This algorithm will serve as a basis for the
Generalized Belief Propagation scheme described in section 4 which will be investigated empirically as a standalone scheme and also as a component in our Importance
Sampling scheme described in section 5.
The join-tree-clustering algorithm for HMNs can be derived in a straightforward way by incorporating ideas from
[Lauritzen, 1992] and we describe it here for completeness sake (see Figure 3). The exact inference algorithm
in [Lauritzen, 1992] works by first forming a join-tree-

to form a single function PC. Here, multiplication can be
performed on the functions in P0 and C0 separately using
the operators in [Lauritzen, 1992] and [Dechter, 2003] respectively to compute a single probabilistic function P and
a single constraint relation C. These two functions P and
C can be multiplied by deleting all tuples in P that are not
present in C to form the required function PC.
We comment on two major technical points for the algorithm given in Figure 3. Firstly, to be sound the join-treeclustering algorithm must satisfy the strong root property
as required by HBNs [Lauritzen, 1992]:

Procedure Message-Passing
• Input: A graph-decomposition (GD(V, E), χ, ψ) for a HMN and an ordering of edges P = [e1 , . . . , ek ] where ei ∈ E.
• Output: An graph-decomposition containing new messages and functions.

decomposition and then passing messages between individual cliques of a join-tree-decomposition. A message
from node Ni to N j is constructed by first multiplying all
messages and functions in Ni excluding the message from
N j and then marginalizing the product over the separator between Ni and NN
j . The operators of marginalization
⇓ and multiplication
required for message-passing on
a join-tree-decomposition of a HMN can be constructed
in a straightforward way by combining the operators in
[Lauritzen, 1992] and [Dechter, 2003] that work on HBNs
and constraint relations respectively. We will now briefly
comment on how the multiplication operator can be derived. Let us assume we want to multiply a collection of
probabilistic functions P0 and a set of constraint relations C0
(which consist of discrete tuples allowed by the constraint)

D EFINITION 3.1 (Strong Root) Given
a
join-treedecomposition (GD(V, E), χ, ψ), a node r ∈ V is a
strong-root iff for all neighboring nodes c and d with c
closer to r than d, we have that sep(c, d) ⊆ ∆ or d \ c ⊆ Γ
where Γ is the set of continuous variables and ∆ is the set
of discrete variables.
A sufficient condition to ensure that there is at least one
strong root in a join-tree-decomposition is to use an ordering for triangulation in which all continuous variables are
ordered before discrete variables. We call such join-treedecompositions as special-join-tree-decompositions (see
Figure 2(c)).
Finally, because Gaussian nodes can be processed in polynomial time, the complexity of processing each clique is
exponential only in the number of discrete variables in the
clique. We capture this property using the definition of
adjusted-width.
D EFINITION 3.2 Given
a
join-graph-decomposition
(GD, χ, ψ), the adjusted-width of a join-graph decomposition is w = max |χ(v) ∩ ∆| − 1. The adjusted-treewidth of
join-tree-decomposition is equal to its adjusted-width.
It is straight forward to show that [Lauritzen, 1992]:
T HEOREM 3.1 Given a HMN MN(X, D, P,C) and evidence

multiplying the messages and functions in each clique is

in the sense that it has the correct first and second moments
as the exact marginal.

of a join-tree-decomposition, d is the maximum domain
size of the discrete variables, ∆ is the set of discrete
variables in the HMN and w∗ is the adjusted-treewidth of
the special-join-tree-decomposition used.

4 ITERATIVE JOIN GRAPH
PROPAGATION
In this section, we extend an approximate inference algorithm called Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP)
to HMNs. IJGP(i) [Dechter et al., 2002] is parameterized Generalized Belief Propagation algorithm which operates on a join-graph-decomposition having less than i +
1 variables in each clique. The complexity of IJGP(i)
is bounded exponentially by i, also called the i-bound.
This algorithm was defined for discrete Bayesian Networks
in [Dechter et al., 2002].
IJGP(i) can be extended to HMNs in a straight-forward
way by iteratively applying the message-passing procedure
given in Figure 3 to a join-graph-decomposition until a
maximum number of iterations is performed or until the
algorithm converges.
An important technical difference between the extension of IJGP(i) to HMNs and the original IJGP(i) algorithm [Dechter et al., 2002] is that i stands for adjustedwidth rather than width.
T HEOREM 4.1 The complexity of IJGP(i) when applied to
HMN is O((|∆| + n) ∗ d i ∗ |Γc |3 ) where |∆| is the number
of discrete variables, d is the maximum-domain size of the
discrete variables, i is the adjusted-i-bound, n is the number of nodes in a join-graph and |Γc | is the maximum number of continuous variables in any clique of the join-treedecomposition used.

RAO-BLACKWELLISED
IMPORTANCE SAMPLING

In this section, we propose an effective Importance Sampling for HMNs. We will first review Importance Sampling algorithms for computing posterior distribution and
then review w-cutset sampling which is a special version of
the Rao-Blackwellisation concept. Subsequently, we discuss how an Importance Sampling algorithm would run
into problems when hard constraints are present. We end
the section by presenting an algorithm called IJGP-RBSampling that remedies these problems by using Iterative

Join Graph Propagation to generate an effective proposal
distribution.
Sampling methods are used for approximate inference in
Bayesian Networks and are useful in cases when the distribution is hard to compute analytically using exact inference. The virtue of sampling schemes is that they are
guaranteed to yield the correct posterior distribution when
they converge and they use only linear space. An important
class of sampling algorithms is Importance Sampling for
Bayesian Networks. The idea here is that since we cannot
sample from the true posterior P(X|e) (while it is NP-hard
to compute), we will sample from an approximation Q(X)
such that the ratio w = β ∗ P(X = x|e)/Q(X = x)1 is known
up to a normalizing constant β. We can then compute the
fj
required posterior marginal as P(xi = x|e) = ∑ j f j (x) ∗ w
fj
where f j (x) is the sample that agrees with xi = x and w
fj =
are the normalized importance weights computed as w
w j / ∑k wk . Ideally, the proposal distribution should have
the following properties: (1) It is easy to sample from (2) It
allows easy evaluation of the value Q(X = x) for each sample so that the weights can be computed in a cost-effective
manner and (3) If P(X) 6= 0 then Q(X) 6= 0. The last property ensures that Importance Sampling converges to the
true posterior in limit of convergence [Geweke, 1989].
It is well known that any sampling scheme over multidimensional space can be assisted by Rao-Blackwellised
sampling, namely by sampling over a subspace. We
now describe w-cutset sampling which is a special version of Rao-Blackwellised (RB) sampling. w-cutset sampling [Bidyuk and Dechter, 2003] is a method that combines exact inference and sampling and provides a systematic scheme for sampling from a subset of variables. The
idea is that given an assignment to a set of variables it might
be possible to compute the remaining distribution analytically. More formally, in w-cutset sampling we partition the
set of variables X into two subsets X = X1 ∪ X2 such that
the treewidth of the graphical model when X1 is removed
is bounded by w. Each w-cutset sample consists of an assignment of values to X1 = x1 and a belief state P(X2 |x1 ).
The variables in the set X1 are sampled and the remaining
X2 variables are solved exactly using exact algorithms like
join-tree-clustering.
We can straightforwardly adapt w-cutset Importance Sampling to Hybrid Bayesian Networks (HBNs). Since exact
inference is polynomial if all nodes are Gaussian, w-cutset
sampling in HBNs can be done by sampling only a subset of the discrete variables [Lerner, 2002]. Extending this
idea to HMNs, suggests that we sample the discrete variables using a suitable proposal distribution and discard all
samples that violate one or more constraints. This method
can be inefficient. For example, if we use the prior as
the proposal distribution (as in Likelihood weighting) and
1 This

is usually called Biased Importance Sampling

Algorithm IJGP-RB-Sampling
• Input: A Hybrid Mixed Network MN(X, D, P,C) and Evidence e. Integer i, k, w
and N.
• Output: Estimate of P(X|e).
• Perform Iterative Join-graph propagation on MN with i-bound=i and number of
iterations=k. Let us call its output Π.
• Partition the Variables of HMN into X1 and X2 such that the adjusted-treewidth of
a special- join-tree-decomposition of X2 is bounded by w.
• Create a bucket-tree BT (V, ψ) from Π such that V contains only variables in X1 .
• For i = 1 to N do

node x to node y.
the prior is such that solutions to the constraint portion are
highly unlikely, a large number of samples will be rejected
(because P(X i = 0) for a sample X i and so weight would
be 0).
On the other hand, if we want to make the sample rejection rate zero we would have to use a proposal distribution Q such that all samples from Q are solutions of the
constraint portion. One way to find this proposal distribution is to make the Constraint Network backtrack-free (perhaps using adaptive-consistency [Dechter, 2003]) along an
ordering of variables and then sample along a reverse ordering. However, adaptive-consistency can be costly unless the treewidth of the constraint portion is small. Thus
on one hand, zero-rejection rate implies using a costly inference procedure and on the other hand, sampling from a
proposal distribution that ignores the constraints may result
in a high rejection rate.
We propose to exploit the middle ground between the
two extremes by combining the Constraint Network
and the Bayesian Network into a single approximate
distribution Q using IJGP(i). By using IJGP(i) we
are likely to reduce the rejection-rate because it applies constraint-propagation in the form of relational
i-consistency [Dechter and Mateescu, 2003] , namely
it removes many inconsistent tuples [Dechter, 2003].
Note that the output of IJGP(i) can be used to
generate a proposal distribution because as shown
in [Dechter and Mateescu, 2003] P(X|e) > 0 implies that
Q(X|e) > 0 where Q(X|e) is the distribution of IJGP(i).
We now describe a method to generate samples from the
output of IJGP(i). Here, given an ordering π = hx1 , . . . , x j i
of the discrete variables to be sampled, we first compute an
approximate marginal denoted by Q(x1 ) from the output
of IJGP(i) and then sample x1 from Q(x1 ). Then, we set
the sampled value x1 = a1 as evidence, run IJGP(i), compute the marginal Q(x2 |x1 = a1 ) and sample x2 from this
marginal. The above process is repeated until all variables
are sampled. The method is inefficient however, requiring O(|X1 | ∗ exp(i) ∗ N ∗ d) time for generating all samples

1. si = Generate a sample from BT along the order d of BT for the set of
variables X1 .
2. Use join-tree-clustering to compute the distribution on X2 by setting evidence as e ∪ X1 = si . Lets call it ri .
3. Reject the sample if ri is not a solution.
4. Compute the importance weights wi of si .
• Normalize the importance weights wi .
• Output the samples [si , ri ] and the normalized weights wi

where X1 are the sampled variables, N is the number of
samples, i is the i-bound used and d is the maximum domain size.
Instead, we use a simplified method in which IJGP(i) is applied just once yielding a time-complexity of O(exp(i) +
N ∗ |X1 | ∗ d) to generate all samples. The simplified method
uses a special data-structure of ordered buckets. Given
a collection of functions and messages as the output of
IJGP(i) and an ordering π = hx1 , . . . , x j i of the discrete
variables to be sampled, we construct the ordered buckets structure as follows. We associate a bucket with each
variable xi in π and consider only those functions and messages, Fπ whose scope is included in {x j , . . . , x1 }. We then
start processing from i= j to 1 putting all functions in Fπ
that mention xi in the bucket of xi . Once the ordered buckets structure is created, we sample along the order from i
= 1 to j. The construction procedure guarantees that when
we sample a variable xi from its bucket, all variables ordered before xi are instantiated and there is only a single
un-instantiated variable in each function in the bucket of xi .
So, the time-complexity to sample each bucket is bounded
by O(d) yielding a time-complexity of O(N ∗ |X1 | ∗ d) to
generate all samples. An example ordered buckets structure
for the join-graph-decomposition in Figure 2(b) is given in
Figure 4.
We now describe how to compute the weight of each
sample. According to Rao-Blackwellised Importance
Sampling theory [Geweke, 1989, Doucet et al., 2000], the
weight of each sample X1k over variables X1 is given by
wk = P0 /Q0 such that P0 /Q0 = β ∗ P(X1k |e)/Q(X1k |e), where
β is a constant. We can determine the quantity P(X1k , e) using join-tree-clustering while we can compute Q(X1k , e) (up
to a normalizing constant) from the ordered buckets struc-

ture described above by multiplying individual probabilities. Now since Q(e) = 1, we have
required.

An important advantage of using IJGP(i) in addition to
constraint-propagation is that it may yield good approximation to the true posterior thereby proving to be an ideal
candidate for proposal distribution. The integration of the
ideas expressed above into a formal algorithm called IJGPRB-sampling is given in Figure 5. The algorithm first runs
IJGP(i) for k iterations to generate an approximation to the
true posterior. Then, it partitions the variables X into two
sets X1 and X2 such that the treewidth of the special jointree-decomposition of X2 is bounded by w using a method
proposed in [Bidyuk and Dechter, 2004]. It then creates an
ordered bucket structure over X1 from the output of IJGP(i)
and performs Importance Sampling using the ordered buckets structure as described above. We conclude that:
T HEOREM 5.1 The complexity of IJGP-RB-Sampling(i,w)
is O([N ∗ d w+1 ∗ |Γc |3 ∗ |∆|] + [(|∆| + n) ∗ d i ∗ |Γc |3 ]) where
∆ is the set of discrete variables, d is the maximum-domain
size, i is the adjusted-i-bound, w is the adjusted-w-cutset,
n is the number of nodes in the join-graph and |Γc | is the
maximum number of continuous variables in the clique of
the join-graph-decomposition.

6 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We tested the performance of IJGP(i), pure RBSampling and IJGP-RB-Sampling(i,w) on randomly
generated HMNs.
We used a parametric model
(N1 , N2 , K,C1 ,C2 , P, T ) where N1 is the number of
discrete variables, N2 is the number of Gaussian Variables,
K is the domain-size for each discrete variable, C1 is the
number of constraints allowed and T is the tightness or
the number of forbidden tuples in each constraint, C2 is
the number of conditional probability distributions (CPDs)
and P is the number of parents in each CPD. Parents in
each CPD are picked randomly and each CPD is filled
randomly. Note that each Gaussian CPDs was assigned a
mean and variance randomly chosen in the range (0, 1).
Also no Gaussian variables have discrete children in our
random problems. The constraint portion is generated
according to Model B [Smith, 1994]. In Model B, for a
given N1 and K, we select C1 constraints uniformly at
random from the available N(N − 1)2 binary constraints
and then for each constraint we select exactly T tuples
(called as constraint tightness) as no-goods (or forbidden)
from the available K 2 tuples.
We generated two classes of problems (a) a 50-variable
set with parameters (40, 10, 4, 80, 35, 3, T ) and T was varied with values 4, 6 and 8 and (b) a 100-variable-set with
parameters (90, 10, 4, 180, 95, 3, T ) and T was varied with
values 4, 6 and 8. In each problem class, 10% of the vari-

ables were randomly selected as evidence variables. Each
algorithm was given the same amount of time for computing approximate posterior Beliefs. For the 50-variableset, we let each algorithm run for 20s while for the 100variable-set we let each algorithm run for 100s. The choice
of these time-bounds was arbitrary. Also for each IJGPRB-Sampling(i,w) algorithm instance IJGP(i) is run for 10
iterations only.
For each network, we compute the exact solution using the
join-tree-clustering algorithm and compare the accuracy of
algorithms using: 1. Absolute error - the absolute value of
the difference between the approximate and the exact, averaged over all values, all variables and all problems. 2. Relative error - the absolute value of the difference between
the approximate and the exact, divided by the exact, averaged over all values, all variables and all problems. 3.
KL distance - Pe (xi ) ∗ log(Pe (xi )/Pa (xi )) averaged over all
values, all variables and all problems where Pe and Pa are
the exact and approximate probability values for variable xi
respectively.
For IJGP(i), we experimented with i-bounds of 2, 4 and 6
while for IJGP-RB-Sampling (i, w), we experimented with
i-bound and w of 2, 4 and 6 each. We also experimented
with a w-cutset Importance Sampling algorithm (or pure
RB-Sampling) with w being set to 0, 2, 4 and 6. Thus,
we have a total of 16 algorithms in our experimental setup. We tabulate the results using a 4x4 matrix for each
combination of the problem-set, value of tightness T and
accuracy-scheme (KL-distance, relative and approximate
error). The rows of the matrix are labeled from w=0 to
w=6 in increments of 2 corresponding to the w values used
while the columns are labeled from i = 0 to i = 6 corresponding to the i-bound used. Note that the column-vector
i = 0 gives the results for w-cutset sampling while the row
vector w = 0 gives results for IJGP(i) (except for i = 0
when it gives results for w-cutset sampling). The rest of the
matrix contains results for IJGP-RB-Sampling for different
values of i and w (see Tables 1 and 2).
6.1 EXPERIMENTS ON THE 50-VARIABLE-SET
Results on the 50-variable-set are given in Table 1. The
results are averaged over 100 instances each. Here, we
see that IJGP(i) has slightly better accuracy than IJGP-RBSampling when the problem tightness is low (T = 4) (see
Figure 5, Table 1). However, as we increase the tightness
to (T = 8) the performance of IJGP(i) is worse than IJGPRB-Sampling (see Figure 6, Table 1). As expected the performance of w-cutset sampling improves as w is increased.
However IJGP-RB-sampling shows only a slight improvement in accuracy with increase in w. The accuracy of wcutset sampling is always worse than IJGP(i) and IJGPRB-Sampling and also it deteriorates more rapidly as the
tightness is increased (see Table 1).

6.2 EXPERIMENTS ON THE 100-VARIABLE-SET

7 RELATED WORK AND SUMMARY

Results on the 100-variable-set are given in Table 2. The
results are averaged over 100 instances each. Here, we
see that unlike the 50-variable-set, IJGP(i) has comparable accuracy to IJGP-RB-Sampling when the tightness is
low (T = 4) (see Figure 7 and Table 2). However, as we
increase tightness (T = 8), the accuracy of IJGP(i) is considerably worse than IJGP-RB-Sampling (see Figures 7, 8
and Table 2). Also RB-Sampling is significantly worse than
IJGP-RB-Sampling for various values of w (see Table 2).

A Mixed Network framework for representing deterministic and uncertain information was presented in
[Larkin and Dechter, 2003, Dechter and Mateescu, 2004].
These previous works also describe exact inference algorithms for Mixed Networks with the restriction that all variables should be discrete. Our work goes beyond these previous works in that we describe approximate inference algorithms for the Mixed Network framework and allow continuous Gaussian nodes.

A class of approximate inference algorithms called IJGP(i)
described in [Dechter et al., 2002] handles only discrete
variables. In our work, we extend IJGP(i) to include Gaussian variables and discrete constraints.
Importance Sampling is a commonly used algorithm for
sampling in Bayesian Networks [Geweke, 1989]. A main
step in Importance Sampling is choosing a proposal distribution that is as close as possible to the target distribution.
We show how a bounded inference procedure like IJGP(i)
can be used to select a good proposal distribution.
The main algorithmic contribution of this paper is presenting a class of Rao-Blackwellised Importance Sampling algorithms, IJGP-RB-Sampling for HMNs which integrates
a Generalized Belief Propagation component with a RaoBlackwellised Importance Sampling scheme for effective
sampling in presence of constraints.
Our experimental results are preliminary but very encouraging. Our results on randomly generated HMNs show that
IJGP-RB-Sampling is almost always superior to pure wcutset sampling (RB-Sampling) which does not use IJGP
as a importance function. Our results also show that IJGPRB-Sampling has better accuracy than IJGP when the problem tightness is high or when the number of solutions to the
constraint portion of HMNs is low.
