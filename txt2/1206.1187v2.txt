Important issues here are the speed of generation, the quality of the sequence generated,
and the ability to produce the same sequence using different numbers of threads, number of
hosts and GPU characteristics.
Recently Bailey and Borwein [?] proposed a pseudorandom generator based on binary
representation of normal numbers. For an integer b ≥ 2 we say that a real number K is
b-normal if, for all m > 0, every m-long string of digits in the base-b expansion of K appears,
in the limit, with frequency b−m . That is, with exactly the frequency one would expect if
the digits appeared completely “at random”. The authors presented a thorough theoretical
overview of the topic, and designed a special class of constants αb,c , where b, c > 0 and coprime. They proved that such constants are b-normal, and therefore their base-b expansion
can serve to generate pseudorandom sequences.
A useful feature of the numbers αb,c is that their n−th base−b digit can be calculated
directly, without needing to compute any of the first n − 1 digits. It implies that any element
of the generated sequence can be computed without computing the preceding elements, and
therefore offers the desirable skip ahead feature of a random number generator. It is valuable
for parallel random number generators, as consecutive subsequences of random variates can
be generated concurrently on different processors or even different hosts, and the entire
sequence is identical to the one generated in a single thread.
Bailey and Borwein [?] present a pseudorandom number generator based on the binary
representation of α2,3 , and outline its implementation as a version of LCG, with the period
P = 2·332 ≈ 3.7·1015 . The seed of this generator is the index of the starting element, which is
calculated directly through a simple formula. They suggest its use in parallel computations,
by splitting the sequence of variates into m subsequences (m is the number of threads),
each subsequence i starting from the 1 + (i−1)n
-th element, where n is the desired number of
m
random variates.
In this work we follow the path suggested by Bailey and Borwein and investigate a parallel
2

implementation of their pseudorandom number generator suitable for GPUs. Firstly we
confirm the quality of the random sequence using the comprehensive suite BigCrush from
the TestU01 library [?]. Secondly we port the authors’ implementation [?] to GPU, and
benchmark its speed. Initial investigations found that speed wise the proposed generator
was comparable to but less efficient than the newest GPU-based MT generator mtgp [?].
Therefore we investigate improvements to Bailey’s implementation, which is based on either
106 bit double-double, or 128-bit integer arithmetic. We found several alternatives that use
modular arithmetic, and improved the generation rate four-fold. Lastly we investigate the
impact of GPU architecture on the generation rate, and determine an optimal configuration
concerning the number of threads and thread blocks, and therefore work assigned to each
thread. Our implementation delivers generation rate of 11 Gnumbers/sec on GPU, which is
25% faster than state of the art mtgp, and approaches the maximal rate of 12.4 Gnumbers/sec
imposed by the speed of writing to global memory.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the LCG proposed by Bailey and
Borwein. Section 3 describes improvements that can be made to the original implementation
using modular arithmetic. Numerical experiments are described and results presented in
Section 4. Finally we draw conclusions in Section 5.

Random number generator based on normal numbers

Bailey and Borwein [?] investigated the following class of constants, which was introduced
previously in [?],
∞
X
1
αb,c (r) =
k
c
c b k +rk
k=1
where integers b, c > 1 and co-prime and r ∈ [0, 1], and where rk denotes the k-th binary
digit of r.
Bailey and Crandall [?] proved the following:
Theorem 1 Every number αb,c (r) is b-normal.
Bailey and Borwein focus on the number
α = α2,3 (0) =

∞
X
k=1

1
3k 23k

This number is 2-normal, but is not 6-normal, as Bailey and Borwein show. Further they
show that all constants αb,c are not bc−normal for co-prime integers b, c > 1.
The normality of α suggests that its binary expansion can be used to generate a sequence
of pseudorandom numbers. Let xn = {2n α} be the binary expression of α starting from

3

position n + 1, where {·} denotes the fractional part of the argument. Bailey and Borwein
show that when n is not the power of three
m

(2n−3 ⌊3m /2⌋) mod 3m
+ ε,
xn =
3m

(1)

and the tail of the series ε < 10−30 if n is not within 100 of any power of three.
Then the authors of [?] construct the following algorithm to calculate pseudorandom
64-bit real numbers in (0, 1), which would contain in their mantissas 53-bit segments of the
binary expansion of α
Algorithm BB
1. Select starting index a in the range 333 + 100 to 253 , referred to as the seed of the
generator.
2. Calculate

3. Generate iterates
zk = 253 zk−1

mod 333

(3)

and return zk 3−33 , which are 64 floating point random variates in (0, 1).
Bailey and Borwein note that several operations need to be done with accuracy 106
mantissa bits, i.e., in 106-bit floating point arithmetic. They described and implemented
their algorithm in double-double arithmetic [?]. Note that double-double arithmetic allows
exactly the representations of integers up to 2106 .
The algorithm BB is a version of the LCG, and therefore it’s period can be established
from the theory of LCGs and results in P = 2 · 332 ≈ 3.7 · 1015. The algorithm can be checked
by calculating zk -th iterate recursively, or directly by using formula (2). The binary digits of
α within a range of indices spanned by successive powers of three are given by an LCG with
a modulus that is a large power of three. Of course, by using a modulus, as large as 340 one
can get larger periods, but this will involve a higher number of bits in integer arithmetic, i.e.
128-bit integer arithmetic.
This approach has an advantage over LCGs that use a power of two value as the modulus,
where arrays of pseudorandom data, of size matching a power of two, are accessed by row
and column and therefore have the potential for a reduced period [?]. A modulus as that
proposed by Bailey and Borwein removes this issue.
The direct formula (2) produces the skip ahead property: the ability to calculate the k-th
iterate without iterating through the previous steps. This property is valuable for parallel
random number generators, as every parallel thread can calculate its starting iterate directly
from (2).

Parallelization and improvements to the algorithm

Using Bailey and Borwein’s (BB) implementation [?] as the starting point, we translated it
from FORTRAN to C, and implemented as a parallel random number generator on GPU
platform using CUDA [?]. Our initial tests confirmed that the pseudorandom sequence
produced was identical to the one produced by using the original implementation in a single
thread. Our generation rate was 0.6 Gnumbers per second on Tesla C2050 card.
However, when compared to the state of the art MT generator developed by Saito and
Matsumoto in 2010 [?], which has the rate of over 9 Gnumbers/sec for doubles in (0, 1) on the
same card, the BB’s implementation was not competitive. We note that the MT generator
mtgp we benchmarked against has the periods from 211213 − 1 to 244497 − 1, and is free from
the usual problems of LCG such as small periods and some statistical flaws.
An alternative implementation of the BB algorithm is to use 128 bit arithmetic. NVIDIA
have released such a library for CUDA [?], available to registered developers. This library
implements in software 128 bit arithmetic, as GPU hardware support for 128 bit arithmetic
is not currently available. The generation rate was similar to that of the BB implementation,
still uncompetitive with mtgp.
Nevertheless we were still interested in the BB’s LCG for two reasons. First, LCG’s
implementation is much simpler than that of MTs, and in particular the well optimized implementation from [?]. Simpler implementations are more portable and less tied to hardware
characteristics than complex implementations such as mtgp. Second, BB’s LCG offers an
acceptable period, suitable for many simulation applications, which can also be easily extended using a larger modulus and therefore making the range between consecutive powers
of three larger. Third, MT’s state is larger than that of LCG, and Saito and Matsumoto’s
implementation involves cooperative generation of the sequence by several threads keeping
the state in the shared memory. This could be inconvenient when using this generator in
complex simulations on GPU, as pointed out by [?], which have their own demands on shared
memory. In contrast, BB’s LCG offers fully independent generation of the sequence by different threads and only a 64-bit state. Therefore we investigated possible improvements to
the LCG.
Our focus was the generation step Eq. (3). Eq. (2) needs to be applied only once at
the start of the process, and contributes to the total time only marginally, as long as the
majority of the sequence is generated by Eq. (3).

3.1

Modular arithmetic

A modular reduction is simply the computation of the remainder of an integer division. However, division is a much more expensive operation than multiplication. There are a number
of special methods for performing modular reduction using multiplication, summation and
subtraction, and single precision division.

5

3.1.1

L’Ecuyer method

The first approach to modular reduction in LCG was adapted from P. L’Ecuyer [?]. This
approach follows the earlier work [?], and is based on modular multiplication az mod m,
where m = aq + r, r < a and a2 < m. One has
 
z
r) mod m
az mod m = (a(z mod q) −
q
The algorithm is stated as follows.
Algorithm L’Ecuyer
Input: z, a, m, q = ⌊ ma ⌋, r = m mod a
Output: s = (a · z) mod m
1. t = z div q
2. s = a(s − t · q) − t · r
3. if(s < 0) then s = s + m
4. return s
The quantities q = ⌊ ma ⌋ and r = m mod a are pre-computed. Every intermediate step
remains strictly between −m and m as shown in [?], and hence only one if statement is
needed to perform the modulus operation.
However we cannot use L’Ecuyer’s algorithm directly for calculating 253 zk−1 mod m
because a = 253 > 333 = m, and the algorithm requires a2 < m. Instead we apply this
reduction algorithm twice using a = 225 , and expanding
253 z

mod m = 225 · 2(225 · 4z

mod m)

mod m.

Hence we call L’Ecuyer’s algorithm in the following sequence of calls
z = LEcuyer(4zk−1, a, m, q, r)
zk = LEcuyer(2z, a, m, q, r)
Here all intermediate operations are less than 64-bits. Let us show that s stays in [−m, m].
An essential condition guaranteeing that the intermediate steps are between −m and m, and
hence correctness of mod m in step 3, is z < m [?]. But in our case z = 4zk−1 < 4m, so z
can be larger than m.
We modify the argument from [?] as follows.


 
aq + r
z
r<4
r ≤ 4ar ≤ 4a2 = 4 · 250 = 252 < 333 = m.
q
q
Therefore s at step 2 of L’Ecuyer’s algorithm is between −m and m for our specific values
of m and a, and hence the algorithm works correctly when z ≤ 4m.
We also note that computations are faster if instead of integer division in step 1 we
multiply z by the pre-computed reciprocal of q (a 64-bit floating point number), which
provides sufficient (53-bits) accuracy for our purposes, because its result is between −m and
m. The actual C source code is presented in Figure 1.

3.1.2

Barrett’s reduction

Next, we looked at Barrett’s reduction [?]. Barrett introduced the idea of estimating the
x
⌋ with operations that are either less expensive in time than a multi-precision
quotient ⌊ m
division by m or can be done as a pre-calculation for a given m. Barrett uses the approximation

and the equation x mod m = x − m m
. The term ⌊ 2m ⌋ depends only on m and can be
pre-computed. The other divisions are efficient binary shift operations. The value of k here
is the number of binary digits of m. The algorithm reads as follows
Algorithm Barrett
j 2k k
Input: x = (x2k−1 . . . x1 x0 )2 ,m = (mk−1 . . . , m1 m0 )2 , µ = 2m , x, m > 0, mk−1 6= 0

3. if r < 0 then r = r + 2k+1
4. while r ≥ m do r = r − m
5. return r.
In our case k = 53, and µ is pre-computed in extended arithmetic but is a 64-bit integer
itself. Integer q2 needs extended precision, but q1 and q3 need only 64 bits using binary shift
operations with high and low parts of q2 . Integer q3 · m requires extended arithmetic. Finally
r1 , r2 and r are 64 bit integers. These observations allow one to reduce CPU time. At most
two subtractions at step 4 are needed. The actual C code is presented in Figure 2.

#define barrett_step_simple(rlo)\
xlo = t53 * rlo;\
xhi = __umul64hi (t53, rlo);\
qlo = (xhi << 12) | (xlo >> 52);\

for(int i = 0; i < WorkPerThread; i++)
{
barrett_step_simple(rlo);
output[startindex + i] = r3i * rlo;
}

Figure 2: A fragment of our implementation of the Barrett’s method in C (as a macro).
Note that we use CUDA’s operation umul64hi which returns the most significant 64 bits
of the product of two 64 bit integers.

3.1.3

Modified Barrett’s reduction
j 2k k
We note that with our choice of µ = 2m , at step 1 of Barrett’s algorithm we have q1 =

253 z mod 252 = z mod 2. We questioned whether these two operations can be eliminated
altogether.
We rewrite Barrett’s formula as follows

 x · 22   x · 2  j k

, but the two mentioned operations simplify as follows:
  j 53 k
1) at Step 1 we calculate q1 = 2x53 = 2253z = z;

Then we can keep the same µ =

j

22k
m

2) at Step 2 we have r1 = 253 z mod 253 = 0.
Therefore these two instructions become redundant, and hence we save on CPU time.
Furthermore, since r = 0 − r2 < 0, the if statement in Step 3 is redundant. Finally, because
in our case 333 = m < 2k = 253 < 2m, and because r < 253 , we have r < 2m and therefore
while in Step 4 can be replaced with a cheaper if. Our modified Barrett’s algorithm becomes
Algorithm Modified Barrett
j 2k k
Input: z = (zk−1 . . . z1 z0 )2 ,m = (mk−1 . . . , m1 m0 )2 , µ = 2m , x, m > 0, mk−1 6= 0

Output: r = 2k z mod m
 
1. q2 = µ · z, q3 = 2qk2

2. r2 = q3 · m mod 2k
3. r = 2k − r2

4. if r ≥ m then r = r − m
5. return r.
Our C implementation of this algorithm is shown in Figure 3.
The proposed three methods of reduction have a generation rate of 0.6 Gnumbers/sec,
and still did not match the rate provided by mtgp. Therefore we also attempted to accelerate
calculations using programming techniques. Our first suspicion was the speed of writing to
GPU’s global memory.

3.2

Writing to global memory

It is known that both global and shared memory access pattern affects the performance
of GPU algorithms [?]. Strided access, when the values are read from or written to GPU
memory by each thread not consecutively but with certain steps, helps avoid bank conflicts
and execute read/write operations more efficiently. While on many occasions the generated
random numbers need not be stored in memory but rather used in a simulation routine on
9

#define stepBarrett(z)\
qhi =__umul64hi(z, mu);\
/* high part of $q_2$ */
z *= mu;\
/* low part of $q_2$ */
z = ( ((qhi << 11) | (z >> 53) )* m )&0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFULL; \
z= 0x20000000000000ULL - z; \ /* $2^53 - r_2$ */
if (z >= m) z -= m;
...
for(int i = 0; i < WorkPerThread; i++)
{
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i] = r3i * z;
}

Figure 3: A fragment of our implementation of the modified Barrett’s method in C (as a
macro). Note that x &0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFULL implements x mod 253 operation and the
shifts implement q2 /253 . Operation umul64hi which returns the most significant 64 bits of
the product of two 64 bit integers
GPU, it is helpful to measure the generation rate when the random numbers are written
into an array in the global memory. It allows one to benchmark the algorithm against the
competitors in a fair way, and it also avoids the possibility that some instructions can be
skipped by the optimizer if their results are not used. Furthermore, knowing the speed at
which an algorithm writes arbitrary fixed values into global memory under the same memory
access pattern, one can calculate the actual net generation speed.
For these reasons we also experimented with different steps at which threads write consecutively generated random numbers into global memory, as a function of the number of
threads and thread blocks. As expected, letting each thread to write into consecutive positions in the output array was less efficient, because on GPUs read/writes to global memory
are performed in blocks (of 128 bytes, as specified in CUDA Programmer Manual [?]). Therefore when p concurrent threads write to consecutive positions, they require just one block
write for all p generated values (if they all fit one block), as opposed to p writes when they
write to non-coalescent positions.
While the elements of the generated sequence will not be located in the global memory
consecutively, this is not an issue, because the same access pattern can be applied when they
need to be retrieved by a simulation algorithm (which is a more efficient pattern), therefore
the sequence can be easily restored to its original order.
Our algorithm involves a parameter “step” (see Figure 4), calculated based on the number
of threads and thread blocks. Our optimal configuration on Tesla C2050 involved 512 threads
n
per block, and 4096 elements per thread, and therefore ⌈ 512·4096
⌉ thread blocks. Thus step
was 512 · blocks.
Coalesced memory access improved the generation rate by a factor of more than ten.

10

3.3

Loop unrolling and inlining

Loop unrolling is a standard method for improving numerical performance. Loop unrolling
allows for more computation to be performed without the overhead of managing loop counters
and checking ending conditions, but comes at the expense of additional register usage. We
unrolled the generation loop in each thread as in Figure 4. Unrolling the loop for Barrett’s
method improved generation rate by 4.9%, and the improvement to other methods was
between 1 and 4%.
double r3i=1.0/5559060566555523.0; // pow(3.0, -33.0);
unsigned long long mu = 0x33D9481681D79DULL; // pow(3.0, 33.0) div pow(2,53);
/* Calculate seed z using Eq. (2).*/
for(unsigned int i = 0; i < WorkPerThread; i+=8)
{
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*2] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*3] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*4] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*5] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*6] = r3i * z;
stepBarrett(z);
output[startindex + i*step+step*7] = r3i * z;
}

Figure 4: Partial loop unrolling for modified Barrett’s method.
Another strategy is function inlining. It reduces computation time as no parameters need
to go through stack. One can inline functions by using macros or inline directive. On GPU
the device functions are automatically inlined, and we noticed only marginal benefit in using
macro as opposed to inline function in our implementation of Barrett’ algorithm.

Numerical experiments

The two aspects of the generator to consider are the statistical quality and the generation
rate, presented in the following sections respectively.
11

4.1

Statistical testing

The testing suite BigCrush [?] was applied to the generator algorithm BB. Of the 106 statistical tests, all tests passed except for the BirthdaySpacings tests #13-21 and the ClosePairs
tests #22-24.
The Birthday Spacings tests assume the generation of a value of length 64bit. The BB
algorithm generates a random value of length 53bits, which corresponds to the mantissa of a
double value type. The restrictions placed on the parameters of the Birthday Spacings tests
of BigCrush do not hold when considering only 53bits, therefore the failure of these tests is
expected.
The Close Paris tests, as studied in [?], would expect an LCG to fail with period less
than 260 . Here we have a period of P = 2 · 332 , and a failed test. The rest of the tests (94
in total) were passed, and we conclude that the generated sequence is of a good statistical
quality.

4.2

Numerical testing

Our numerical experiments were performed with an Intel Core i7-860 processor workstation
with 4 GB RAM clocked at 2.8 GHz running Linux (Fedora 12), and with a Tesla C2050
GPU with 448 cores, 3 GB of global memory, and clocked at 1.15 GHz. We selected our
version of Bailey and Borwein’s algorithm [?] referred to as BCN, its 128-bit arithmetic
implementation BCN128bit, the LCG adapted from L’Ecuyer [?] LCN, Barrett’s reduction
[?], and a modified version of Barrett’s, refer to sections 2 and 3, for analysis. These methods
were compared with a serial implementation of each, run on a CPU, and also compared with
parallel generators, mtgp [?] and the CUDA-SDK Mersenne twister [?].
Each kernel was timed for 100 iterations for varying threads per block counts, ranging
from 128 threads per block to 512 threads per block, with a step of 32 threads. The timing
information for the best thread count was recorded. The need for different thread counts is
attributed to the varying register demands of each kernel. The unrolled kernels in particular
require more registers, affecting the occupancy and therefore can be tuned by varying the
thread count.
The generation rate for the various methods, averaged over 100 runs, is given in Table
1. The table includes the rate at which numbers are generated with and without the time
required to setup the generator, for example the time required to generate a starting seed
for each thread in the BCN methods. The table shows the increase of the generation rate as
techniques to speed up CUDA were applied, such as coalesced memory access and unrolling.
The Constant methods in the table refer to a simple CUDA implementation where a
single constant value is written back to global memory. This method provides a maximum
generation rate that we are able to obtain. Since the Constant methods use the same memory
access as the random number generators, they describe the maximum rate achievable due to
memory access bottlenecks.
In Table 1 it is evident that coalesced memory access increases the generation rate of
the kernels, this is especially true in the case of memory bound algorithms such as the ones

under analysis here. The improvements unrolling can make can also be seen, however this
is a slight improvement when compared to the coalesced improvement.
From Table 1 it can be seen that the CPU-based serial methods are inferior to those of
the generators running in parallel in CUDA. While global memory access is expensive in
CUDA, on CPU it does not represent a bottleneck. Indeed, ConstantSerial method entry
shows a very high memory write rate, which indicates that contribution due to memory
access on CPU is negligible, and the serial algorithm is CPU bound. In contrast, the GPU
algorithm is clearly memory bound.
The generation rate of the BarrettModified method can be seen to approach that of the
Constant method. If we remove the memory access bottleneck from the timing results, as
seen in Table 2, an appreciation of the net generation rate without expensive memory access
can be made. Here the parallel optimized Barrett method exceeds the serial implementation
by approximately 19%.

Serial methods under different compilers

Our GPU parallel implementation of the Barrett’s method involves the function umul64hi
as part of one 128-bit multiplication, see Figure 3. This is CUDA’s compiler nvcc intrinsic function, which is supported only on the GPU device. We experimented with several
alternative implementations for CPU, which depend on both the compiler and hardware.
There is a generic implementation of this function available from http://opencl-usu-2009.
googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inc/dynlink/device functions dynlink.h, presented in Figure 5.
Microsoft Visual Studio offers the intrinsic function umul128 which performs 128-bit
multiplication of two 64-bit unsigned integers and returns the high and low bits of the result.
Gcc compiler on Linux (64-bit version only) offers the function mul128 which returns the
128-bits result (data type uint128 t). This function in particular is translated into just
three assembler instructions on Intel 64-bit processors, and is therefore extremely efficient.
The usage of these functions is also shown in Figure 5.
Therefore we expect that the efficiency of the generation on CPU will depend on the
hardware and compiler being used, and also the compilation parameters. In Table 2 we
present generation rates on different machines under different compilers. What is noticeable
14

is that the original BCN implementation performs quite well in some cases, although on 64
bit Intel architecture our modified Barrett method still delivers the highest generation rate.
It is interesting that modified L’Ecuyer’s method produced the highest generation rate in
the debug mode (i.e., no compiler optimizations), while it lags behind in the release mode.
For comparison, we also timed the standard C function rand (often criticized for its
low statistical quality) by calculating uniform pseudorandom numbers from (0,1) using the
following instructions:
const double RAND MAX INV=1.0/(RAND MAX+1.0);
rand()*RAND MAX INV;
We found that the generation rate of the rand function is less than half of the rate of the
Barrett method, and is comparable to the L’Ecuyer’s method.
The speedup offered by the GPU is noticeable from Tables 2-3, and when excluding access
to GPU global memory, is more than 1000-fold.

Conclusion

We presented a pseudorandom number generation algorithm based on Bailey and Borwein’s
work on normal numbers and their original implementation as a version of LCG. We confirmed that the generated sequence is statistically suitable for simulation purposes by running
a comprehensive BigCrush suite of tests. We improved Bailey and Borwein’s implementation
by implementing a special modular reduction algorithm, which gave speedup of the factor
of 4 on a CPU. Our generator is twice as fast as the standard C function rand().
Further, we implemented a parallel version of the proposed algorithm suitable for GPUs
and benchmarked it against the state-of-the-art Mersenne Twister parallel generator mtgp.
We found that our implementation is faster than mtgp, and our generation rate is close
to the limiting rate imposed by the efficiency of writing to GPU’s global memory. While
MT’s period is much longer than that of LCG, our LCG’s advantage over mtgp is the simplicity and portability of implementation, independent generation of subsequences and less
demand on GPU’s scarce shared memory. We achieved speedup of 1000 times over the

15

performance of random variate generator on CPU. Our implementation is available from
http://www.deakin.edu.au/∼gleb/bcn random.html.
