INTRODUCTION

The junction tree propagation method (Jensen et al.,
1990; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988) is designed
for propagation in Markov networks:
•

cjl'(S)!cjl(S)

an undirected graph with discrete variables as
nodes;

•

for each clique

U

in the graph there is a poten­

tial <Pu, which is a non-vanishing function from
the set of configurations of

U

to the set of non­

negative reals.

A junction tree over the cliques is characterized by the

so-called junction tree property: For each pair U, V
of cliques with intersection S, all cliques on the path
between U and

V containS.

The propagation part of the method consists of

between neighbours in the junction tree, each po­
tential in the junction tree holds the (possibly non­
normalized) marginal of the joint probability distribu­
tion for the entire set of variables. In fact, the message
passing can be organized so that it is sufficient with
exactly one pass in each direction of the links in the
junction tree. Therefore, in complexity considerations
for propagation in junction trees, one can associate a
local measure

C(U, V) to

links

(U, V),

where

C(U, V)

indicates time/space consumption for the two passes.

Optimal Junction Trees

The compilation is not deterministic. Markov net­
works may have several different triangulations yield­
ing different sets of cliques, and a triangulated network
may have several different junction trees. We therefore
would like to have algorithms yielding optimal trian­
gulations and optimal junction trees with respect to
complexity. However, the optimality problem for tri­
angulations isN'J'-complete (Arnborg et al., 1987).
In the first part of the paper, we address the optimal­
ity problem for junction trees given the triangulated
graph, and we present a simple algorithm which is
quadratic in the number of cliques.
In the last section, we address the triangulation pro­
cess and ask the question whether it may be possible
to come up with a propagation method which does not
contain anN'J'-hard optimality problem. The answer
is discouraging. We show that any local calculation
method must involve a hidden triangulation, and we
use this to conclude that the method is either less ef­
ficient than the junction tree method, or it has an
N'J'-hard optimality problem.

JUNCTION TREES AND
MAXIMAL SPANNING TREES

Throughout the remainder of the paper, we consider a

triangulated connected graph G with clique set e. The
cliques of G are denoted b.I the letters U, V, W, ll1,
etc. We shall not distinguish between a clique and
its set of variables. So we talk of the intersection of
cliques meaning the set of variables common to the
cliques. Intersections are denoted by letters R,S, R1,
etc.
Definition 1 The junction graph for G has e as nodes,
and for each pair U, V of cliques with nonempty inter­
section R there is a link with label R. Each link has a
weight which is the number of variables in the label.
Theorem 1 A spanning tree for the junction graph
of G is a junction tree if �nd only if it is a spanning
tree of maximal weight.

Theorem 1 has been proved independently by Shibata
{1988) and Jensen (1988). Here we will give a proof
much simpler than the o:tiginal ones. Before giving the
proof, we shall recall two algorithms for the construc­
tion of maximal spanning trees.

Algorithm 2 (Kruskal)

Choose successively a link of maximal weight not pro­
ducing a cycle.
Kruskal's algorithm works with a forest of partial max­
imal weight spanning trees. Whenever a link is cho­
sen, two partial trees are connected into a new partial
spanning tree of maximal weight.
Both algorithms result in maximal weight spanning
trees, and each maximal weight spanning tree can
be constructed through any of the two algorithms.
[Proofs can be found in many textbooks on graph
algorithms, e.g., (Goudran and Minoux, 1984) and
(McHugh, 1990)].
Proof of Theorem 1:
Let T be a spanning tree of
maximal weight. Let it be constructed by Prim's al­
gorithm such that T1 �
� Tn =T is a sequence of
partial maximal weight spanning trees.
· ·

·

Assume that T is not a junction tree. Then, at some
stage m, we have that Tm. can be extended to a junc­
tion tree T1 while Tm.+1 cannot. Let (U, V) with la­
belS be the link chosen at this stage; V E Tm.+ 1 (see
Figure 2).
Since Tm.+ 1 cannot be extended to a junction tree, the
link (U, V) is not a link in T1• So, there is a path in T1
between U and V not containing (U, V). This path
must contain a link (U1, V') with labelS' such that
U 1 E T m. and V1 (j_ Tm. (see Figure 2).
Since T 1 is a junction tree, we must haveS �S1, and
sinceS was chosen through Prim's algorithm at this
stage, we also have S
l I;::: 1511. Hence, S =51•

Algorithm 1 (Prim)
(1) Put N {U}, where U is an arbitrary node.

Now, remove the link (U1, V1) from T' and add the
link (U, V). The result is a junction tree extending
Tm.+ 1, contradicting the assumption that it cannot be
extended to a junction tree.

(2) Choose successively a link (W, V) of maximal
weight such that W E N and V (j_ N, and add V
toN.

Next, let T be any non maximal spanning tree. We
shall prove that T is not a junction tree. Again, let

OPTIMAl JUNCTION TREES

W henever the junction graph has several spanning
trees of maximal weight, there are accordingly several
junction trees. Assume that there is a real-valued mea­

sure on junction trees yielding a priority among them,
and assume that this measure can be decomposed to

nents, and therefore the thinning chosen has no impact
on the next stage.

Hence, if we in the construction

have a secondary priority (cost, say), we can perform
the thinning by using Kruskal's algorithm according
to cost. In this way we will end up with a maximal
weight spanning tree of minimal cost (see Figure

3).

We conclude these considerations with

The considerations to come are somewhat specula­

we call the results 'statements' rather than theorems.
However, a reader looking for alternative propagation
methods can use them as guidelines preventing inves­

A graph representing a general propagation task.

U {A, . . . , B} is a universe consisting of a finite set
of discrete variables. The joint probability P(U} is a
distribution over the configurations Xu =Ax · · · x B.
=

A local representation of P(U) consists of a set
{P(U,), ... , P(Un)}, where U, . . . , lin is a covering
of U, and P(U;,} is the marginal distribution of Ui.
A local representation can be visualized by a graph G
with the variables as nodes and with a link between
two variables if there is a Ui containing both; G is
called the representing graph.
The propagation task can be formulated as follows.
Let P 1(Ui) be substituted forP(Uil; ifP1(U} P(U} x
P1(Ui)/P(Ui) is well-defined, then calculate the new
marginals P1(U,), ... , P'(Unl·
=

By a scene for a propagation task, we understand a
universe U together with a covering U1, ... , lin such
that the covering equals the cliques in the representing
graphs. An instance of a propagation task is a pair
(G, P), where G is an undirected graph, and P is a set
of marginals of a joint distribution P(U) to the cliques
of G.
Let U be a universe. By a local method on U, we un­
derstand an algorithm working only on subsets of U.
More precisely: The algorithm consists of a control
structure and a fixed set Pr1, ... , Pr = of proce­
dures such that each Pri only processes information
on Vi c; U. We call Vi the scope of Pri. The repre­
senting graph G1 for a local method is defined as the
graph with U as nodes, and with links between vari­
ables if there is a scope containing them. Notice that
the cliques of G 1 need not be scopes.
We have defined a local method such that the control
structure mainly consists of controlling message pass­
ing between procedures. Note that between Pr;. and
Pri only information on Vi n Vi is worth passing.

First, we shall transform the problem to propositional
calculus.
Lemma 1 Let P(U,), ... , P(Uml be projections of
the joint probability table P(U). Let Pos(U} be the
table of possible configurations of U:

Pos(u} =

{�

if P(u) > 0
otherwise

{�

if P (ud > 0
otherwise

Define Pos(U;.) as:
Pos(u;,}

=

Then Pos(Ui} 1 if and only if Ui is a projection
of a possible configuration.
=

Proof: Since P(U;.) is the marginal of P(U), we have
that P(u;,} > 0 if and only if ut is the projection of at
least one configuration with positive probability.
1
The lemma shows that any scheme for belief updating
has the calculus of possible configurations in proposi­
tional calculus as a special case. So, if we can prove
Statement 1 for this calculus, we are done.
We shall start with an example which is the corner­
stone of the proof.
Example 1 Let the graph in Figure 5 represent a gen­
eral propagation task over the propositional calculus,
and let Pas be the potential giving 1 for possible con­
figurations and 0 for impossible ones.

Let PrAs, PrAc, Prsn, Prnc be procedures for solv­
ing the task {the index indicates the scope, see Fig­
ure 6).

A general local belief updating method for a scene
represented by G is a local method solving the propa­
gation task for each instance (G, P}.

We shall construct an instance which cannot be solved
by the procedures. For each variable we only use the
first two states. This means that all other states are
impossible.

We aim at the following:

Initially, we have for i, j ::; 2

Statement 1

eral local belief updating method be represented by
the graph G 1• Then G1 contains a triangulation

Proof of Statement 1:
Assume that G 1 does not
contain a triangulation of G. Then there is a cycle C
in G such that the subgraph of G 1 consisting of the
nodes in C is not triangulated. Let C' be a chordless
cycle of length greater than three in that subgraph.
Let A 1 , ... , An be the nodes of C'.

FIGURE 6.

The scopes for the procedures and the communication
channels.
That is, A and C as well as B and D are forced into
the same state, and everything else is possible. Note
that the Pas-relations above are projections of the Pas­
relation over the universe:

if and only if
Pos ( U>. bi}

Pos ( ai, ck}

Pos(bj, df)

Pos(ck, de)

Now, assume we get the information that the config­
urations (a1, b2) and (a2, b1) are impossible. This is
equivalent to replacing the relation Pos(ai, bj) by
Pos1(ai, bj)

=

1

if and only if

i

=

j

(and i,j � 2).

Now, the propagation task is to determine Pos' (A, C),
Pos ' (B , D), and Pos ' (C, D) such that these local rela­
tions are projections of the unique universal relation
Pos'(A, B, C, D), satisfying the relations Pos'(A, B),
Pos(A, C), Pos(B, D), and Pos(C, D).
Clearly, Pos'(ai,bi>ck,dt)

The tool for achieving this result is the set PrA s ,
PrAc, Prso, and Prco of procedures. Since PrAB can
only process information on the variables A and B, and
PrAc can only process information on A and C, then
the only valuable information to communicate be­
tween the two procedures is information on A (see Fig­
ure 6). That is, between Pr1 and Prz with scopes V1
and V2, respectively, only information on V 1 n V2 need
to be communicated. The new relation Pos'(A, B) in­
troduces a constraint between the state of A and the
state of B, but since only information on A alone and
B alone can be communicated, the constraint cannot
be communicated to Prc0.
Note that if a cycle contains more than 4 variables, the
construction can be extended by clamping the states
of further intermediate variables.

We now can construct an instantiation, which cannot
be propagated correctly: (1) Let a configuration be
possible if and only if its projection to A1 x · · · x An
is possible. (2) Perform the construction as shown in
the example.
1
By the proof of Statement 1, we see that it can be
generalized to systems with other uncertainty calculi
like, e.g., Dempster-Shafer belief functions or fuzzy
systems. In fact, the reasoning can be applied to any
calculus having propositional calculus as a special case.
An axiomatization of these possible calculi is outside
the scope of this paper, but the axioms in (Shenoy and
Shafer, 1990) form a good starting point.
Concerning complexity we still have a couple of loose
ends. Although a general scheme involves a hidden tri­
angulation, the computational complexity needs not
be of the same kind as for the junction tree scheme.
In the junction tree scheme the complexity is propor­
tional to the number of configurations in the cliques.
Therefore a general local scheme has an equivalent
computational complexity if it is proportional to the
number of configurations in the scopes. This is the
case if each configuration has an impact on the mes­
sages sent in the algorithm. In this paper we shall not
give sufficient conditions for this to hold.
The second loose end has to do with optimality. A gen­
eral scheme is, e.g., to work with P(U) only. This cor­
responds to working with the complete graph over U.
This scheme has a trivial optimality problem, but the
junction tree method can do much better even for sub­
optimal triangulations. Therefore we conclude:

Statement 2 If a general local propagation scheme
has a complexity at least proportional to the num­
ber of configurations in the scopes, and its opti­
mality problem can be solved in polynomial time,
then either the junction tree scheme can do better
or 'J' = N'J'.
