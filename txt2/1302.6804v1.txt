Cost of consistency of a formula

KPK(l_) = +oo is easy to understand, because it is
impossible to have PK consistent with 1... Let us note
that /(pK ( T) is the cost of any PK-preferred inter­

This quantity KPK(T) is important, because it mea­

expensive it will be to recover the consistency). If the
penalties are all equal to +oo then KpK(T) can only
take two values: 0 if and only if PK is consistent, and
+oo if and only if PK is inconsistent.
Example: J(PK, (T) = 5; the only minimum cost in­
terpretation is {a, b, -.c}. To make PK1 consistent, the
least expensive solution is to take off (or to ignore) the

Cost of a sub-theory

Definition 4 (Pinkas 91 [17J) The cost CPK (A) of
a sub-theory A of PK, is the sum of the penalties of
the formulas of PK that are not in A:

For instance, considering the knowledge base PK1,

sub-theory of PK has an infinite cost, therefore
every sub-theory of PK is 2:PK-preferred, but ob­
viously every sub-theory is not necessarily maxi­

Besides, if PK is consistent, then I<PK(T) = 0,
and then the only >pK-preferred sub-theory of
PK is PK itself (its Zost is 0).

Inconsistency handling with penalty logic

Using penalties to handle inconsistency is a syntax­
based approach, in the sense of [16], which means that

the way a know ledge base be hav es is dependent on the
syntax of the input (this is justified by the fact that
each formula is considered as an independent piece of

information); for instance, {p,q,....,pY -,q} will not be­
have as {p 1\ q, ....,p Y ....,q}, since in the first. case we ca.n

In order to deal with inconsistency, the basic idea de­

port functions in order to rank interpretations can be

d on e a.lt.erna.ti vely with penalty logic.

This also brings to light. a relation bet.ween penalties
and [25] where each formula 'Pi of the knowledge base is
considered to be given by a distinct source, this source
having the pro bability p; to be faulty (i.e., the infor­
mation it provides us with is not pertinent), and all

so u rces being independent (which gives the simple sup­
port function m;(cpi) = (1- p;) and m;(T) = p,:). So
if the task is only to find the most plausible interpre­
tation (as in [11] which i s the C o ns tr aint Satisfaction
counterpart of [25]), it can thus be done equivalently
with penalti. Ps.

Formula costs as infinitesimal
plausibilities

Let us consider an infinitesimal version of Dempster­

Shafer theory, where the masses involved are all in­
finitely close to 0 or to 1. Let c be an infinitely small
quantity2•3. Again, let PK = {(cp;,a;},i = 1. .. n}.
Let us define, for each i, the infinitesimal body of evi­
dence m,,;:

i=l

where P l; is the plausibility function induced by m;.
Moreover, Pl;(w) = 1 if w f= 'Pi and Pl;(w) = e-c., if
w f= -,'Pi. Thus,

then possibly to select one of the (or all ) cheapest in­
t.erpretat.ion(s). Namely, this is eno ugh for inducing
the inference relation \--- �K, for solving discrete op­
timization proble m s, and also for applying p en alties
to constraint satisfaction problems or abduction. So,
ha ndlin g penalties in su ch a purpose is nothing but
performing Dempster's combination on s impl e sup­
port functions. Reciprocally, combining simple sup­

Therefore, kpK(w) = -ln(p!(w)): up to a logarithmic
transformation, kPK is a contour function, or mo re pre­
cisely, the process consisting in computing kpr< corre­
sponds to applyin g Dempster's combination without
re-norma.lization on simple support functions. Thi s
equivalence does not extend to an equivalence between
]{pK and a plausibility function (see subsec ti on 3.2}.
but this result is already significant, since in most prac­
t ic al applications of penalty logic, only the contour

Used to handle inconsistency and perform non­
monotonic inferences, penalty logic has shown to have
interesting properties. Using penalties for selecting
preferred sub-theories of an inconsistent knowledge
base not only allows to distinguish between the degree
of importance of various formulas, as usual priority­
based approaches do, but also to express possible com­
pensations between formulas. The non-monotonic in­
ference relation defined satisfies the usual postulates
[13] and is (logarithmically) related to an infinitesimal
version of Dempster-Shafer theory.
Furthermore, the complexity of the penalty non­
monotonic deduction problem has been considered in
[5] and is ranked as one of the most simple non­
monotonic inference problem (in��).

Conclusion

��).c:miniER(PK,�) Z.v a,

Now,

Penalty logic may also been considered as a logical lan­
guage for expressing discrete optimiza tion problems.
The search for a preferred interpretation has been im­
plemented using an A -like variant of Davis and Put­
nam p ro ced u re (6] and has been tested on small ex­
amples. Randomized search algorithms such as GSAT
[23, 22] could also be considered, but they do not guar­
antee that an optimum is actually reached.
•

As shown in [5], solving the problem of searching a
preferred interpretation allows to simply solve the non­
monotonic inference problem, without any restriction
on the language of the formulas expressed4. Any­
way, even the limited ll.� complexity can be consid­
ered as excessive when faced to practical applications.
A reasonable approach would then consist in defining
a gradual inference relation and in trying only to solve
an approximation of the resulting gradual inference
problem.

one could consider associating many unrelated penal­
ties to a single formula. Partially ordered penalty vec­
tors would then replace penalties. Another possible ex­
tension consists in taking into account not only penal­
ties caused by violations but also profits associated to
satisfactions (which could be expressed using negative
penalties).
Acknowledgements

Therefore,

Note that r(PK, ¢) does not depend on .::, and more­
r(PK, '¢) > 0. So, up to a logarithmic
transformation and a multiplicative constant (in other
terms, if we consider only the orders of magnitude
w. r. t. c::), Kpl( is equivalent to an infinitesimal plausi­
bility function.

We would like to express our thanks to Didier Dubois
and Henri Prade for helpful suggestions concerning
the link between penalties and Dempster-Shafer the­
ory, and Michel Cayrol for having found an error in
a preliminary version. This work has been partially
supported by the ESPRIT BRA project DRUMS-2.

Using an ATMS for computing candidates and pre­

ferred sub-theories could also be considered, but the re­
sulting complexity is more important in the general case

[19].
