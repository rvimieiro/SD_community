From the analyses we are aware of, such as (Gretton
et al., 2009) on the confidence bound of the RND by
KMM, (Kanamori et al., 2012) on the convergence rate
of the least-squares estimate of the RND, and (Cortes
et al., 2008) on the distributional stability, they all
assume that certain functions lie in the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) induced by some user selected kernel. Since this assumption is impossible to
verify (even worse, almost certainly violated in practice), one naturally wonders if we can replace it with
something more reasonable. Such goal is pursued in
this paper and constitutes our main contribution.
We consider the following simple problem: Given the
tr
training sample {(Xitr , Yitr )}ni=1
and the test sample
te nte
{Xi }i=1 , how well can we estimate the expected value
EY te , provided covariate shift has happened? Note
that we do not observe the output Yite on the test
sample. This problem, at a first glance, ought to be

“easy”, after all we are humbly asking for estimating a scalar. Indeed, under usual assumptions, plus
the nearly impossible assumption that the regression
function lies in the RKHS, we prove a parametric rate,
−1

that is O(ntr 2 + nte 2 ), for the KMM estimator in Theorem 1 below (to fix ideas, we focus exclusively on
KMM in this paper). For a more realistic assumption on the regression function that we borrow from
learning theory (Cucker & Zhou, 2007), the convergence rate, proved in Theorem 2, degrades gracefully
−

−

θ

to O(ntr 2(θ+2) +nte 2(θ+2) ), where θ > 0 is a smoothness
parameter measuring certain regularity of the regression function (in terms of the kernel). Observe that in
the limit when θ → ∞, the regression function eventually lies in the RKHS and we recover the previous
parametric rate. In this regard our bound in Theorem 2 is asymptotically optimal. A very nice feature
we discovered for the KMM estimator is that it does
not require knowledge of the smoothness parameter θ,
thus, it is in some sense adaptive.
On the negative side, we show that, if the chosen kernel does not interact very well with the unknown regression function, the convergence rate of the
KMM estimator could be exceedingly slow, roughly
·nte
), where s > 0 again measures certain
O(log−s nntrtr+n
te
regularity of the regression function. This unfortunate
result should draw attention to the importance of selecting which kernel to be used in practice. A thorough
comparison between the KMM estimator and the natural plug-in estimator, conducted in Section 4.3, also
reveals the superiority of the former.
We point out that our results are far from giving a
complete picture even for the simple problem we consider here, for instance, it is unclear to us whether or
not the rate in Theorem 2 can be improved, eventually,
to the parametric rate in Theorem 1? Nevertheless, we
hope that our paper will convince others about the importance and possibility to work with more reasonable
assumptions under covariate shift, and as an example,
suggest relevant tools which can be used to achieve
that goal.

2. Preliminaries
In this section we formally state the covariate shift
problem under our consideration, followed by some relevant discussions.
2.1. Problem Setup
Consider the familiar supervised learning setting,
where we are given independent and identically disntr
tributed (i.i.d.) training samples {(Xitr , Yitr )}i=1
from

the joint (Borel) probability measure Ptr (dx, dy) on
the (topological) domain X × Y, and i.i.d. test samte
from the joint probability measure
ples {Xite }ni=1
Pte (dx, dy) on the same domain. Notice that we do
not observe the output Yite on the test sample, and
more importantly, we do not necessarily assume that
the training and test sample are drawn from the same
probability measure. The problem we consider in this
paper is to estimate the expected value EY te from the
tr
and the test sample
training sample {(Xitr , Yitr )}ni=1
te nte
{Xi }i=1 . In particular, we would like to determine
how fast, say, the 1 − δ confidence interval for our estimate shrinks to 0 when the sample sizes ntr and nte
increase to infinity.
This problem, in its full generality, cannot be solved
simply because the training probability measure can
be completely irrelevant to the test probability measure that we are interested in. However, if the two
probability measures are indeed related in a nontrivial way, our problem becomes solvable. One particular
example, which we focus on hereafter, is known in the
literature as covariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000):
Assumption 1 (Covariate shift assumption)
Ptr (dy|x) = Pte (dy|x).

(1)

We use the same notation for the joint, conditional and
marginal probability measures, which should cause no
confusion as the arguments would reveal which measure is being referred to. Note that the equality
P(dx, dy) = P(dy|x)·P(dx) holds from the definition of
the conditional probability measure, whose existence
can be confirmed under very mild assumptions.
Under the covariate shift assumption, the difficulty of
our problem, of course, lies entirely on the potential
mismatch between the marginal probability measures
Ptr (dx) and Pte (dx). But the Bayes rule already suggests a straightforward approach:
Pte (dx, dy) = Pte (dy|x)·Pte (dx) = Ptr (dx, dy)·

dPte
(x),
dPtr

where the three quantities on the right-hand side can
all be estimated from the given samples. However, in
order for the above equation to make sense, we need
Assumption 2 (Continuity assumption) The
te
Radon-Nikodym derivative β(x) := dP
dPtr (x) is welldefined and bounded from above by B < ∞.
Note
that B ≥ 1 due to the normalization constraint
R
β(x)P
tr (dx) = 1. The Radon-Nikodym derivative
X
(RND) is also called the importance weight or the
density ratio in the literature. Evidently, if β(x) is

Analysis of Kernel Mean Matching under Covariate Shift

not well-defined, i.e., there exists some measurable
set A such that Pte (A) > 0 and Ptr (A) = 0, then
in general we cannot infer Pte (dx, dy) from merely
Ptr (dx), Pte (dx) and Ptr (dy|x), even under the covariate shift assumption. The bounded from above assumption is more artificial. Recently, in a different
setting, (Cortes et al., 2010) managed to replace this
assumption with a bounded second moment assumption, at the expense of sacrificing the rate a bit. For us,
since the domain X will be assumed to be compact, the
bounded from above assumption is not too restrictive
(automatically holds when β(x) is, say, continuous).
Once we have the RND β(x), it becomes easy to correct the sampling bias caused by the mismatch between Ptr (dx) and Pte (dx), hence solving our problem.
Formally, let
Z
m(x) :=
y Pte (dy|x)

Y

be the regression function, then

similarly to most publications on covariate shift, our
problem boils down to estimating the RND β(x).

H. To simplify later analysis, we have chosen to omit
Pntr
β̂i − 1 ≤ ,
the normalization constraint n1tr i=1
where  is a small positive number, mainly to reflect the fluctuation caused by random samples. It
is not hard to verify that (3) is in fact an instance
of quadratic programming, hence can be efficiently
solved. More details can be found in the paper of
Gretton et al. (2009).
A finite sample 1−δ confidence bound for L̂(β) (similar
as (10) below) is established in Gretton et al. (2009).
This bound is further transferred into a confidence
bound for the generalization error of some family of
loss minimization algorithms in Cortes et al. (2008),
under the notion of distributional stability. However,
neither results can provide a direct answer to our problem: a finite sample confidence bound on the estimate
of EY te .

2.2. A Naive Estimator?
2.4. Plug-in Estimator
An immediate solution for estimating β(x) is to estimate the two marginal measures from the training sample {Xitr } and the test sample {Xite }, respectively. For instance, if we know a third (Borel) measure
Q(dx) (usually the Lebesgue measure on Rd ) such that
dPtr
te
both dP
dQ (x) and dQ (x) exist, we can employ standard density estimators to estimate them and then set
dPtr
te
β̂(x) = dP
dQ (x)/ dQ (x). However, this naive approach
is known to be inferior since density estimation in high
dimensions is hard, and moreover, small estimation ertr
ror in dP
dQ (x) could change β̂(x) significantly. To our
knowledge, there is little theoretical analysis on this
seemingly naive approach.
2.3. A Better Estimator?
It seems more appealing to directly estimate the RND
β(x). Indeed, a large body of work has been devoted to this line of research (Zadrozny, 2004; Huang
et al., 2007; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Cortes et al., 2008;
Bickel et al., 2009; Kanamori et al., 2009). From the
many references, we single out the kernel mean matching (KMM) algorithm, first proposed by Huang et al.
(2007) and is also the basis of this paper.

Another natural approach is to estimate the regression
function from the training sample and then plug into
the test set. We postpone the discussion and comparison with respect to this estimator until section 4.3.

3. Motivation
We motivate the relevance of our problem in this section.
Suppose we have an ensemble of classifiers, say,
{fj }N
all trained on the training sample
j=1 ,
tr
{(Xitr , Yitr )}ni=1
.
A useful task is to compare,
hence rank, the classifiers by their generalization
errors. This is usually done by assessing the classifiers
te
on some hold out test sample {(Xite , Yite )}ni=1
. It is
not uncommon that the test sample is drawn from
some different probability measure than the training
sample, i.e. covariate shift has happened. Since it
could be too costly to re-train the classifiers when the
test sample is available, we nevertheless still like to

A thorough background on the theory of reproducing
kernels can be found in Aronszajn (1950).

have a principled way to rank the classifiers.
Let `(·, ·) be the user’s favourite loss function, and set
tr
te
Zij
= `(fj (Xitr ), Yitr ), Zij
= `(fj (Xite ), Yite ), then we

can use the empirical average of {Zij
te
the generalization error, that is E(Zij
), of classifier
fj . But what if we do not have access to Yite hence
te
consequently Zij
? Can we still accomplish the ranking
job?

The equality in (5) indeed holds under at least two conditions (respectively). First, if the regression function
m ∈ H, then taking inner products with m in (4) and
applying the reproducing property we get (5). Second,
if the kernel k is characteristicR(Sriperumbudur et al.,
2010), meaning that the map X Φ(x)P(dx) from the
space of probability measures to the RKHS H is injective, then we conclude β̂ ∗ = β from (4) hence follows
(5).

The answer is yes, and it is precisely the covariate
shift problem under our consideration. To see that,
tr ntr
te
. Under
consider the pair {Xitr , Zij
}i=1 and {Xite }ni=1
the covariate shift assumption, that is Ptr (dy|x) =
Pte (dy|x), it is not hard to see that Ptr (dz|x) =
Pte (dz|x), hence the covariate shift assumption holds
for the ranking problem, therefore the confidence
bounds derived in the next section provide an effective solution.

The above two cases suggest the possibility of solving our problem by KMM. Of course, in reality one
only has finite samples from the underlying probability
measures, thus calls for a thorough study of the empirical KMM, i.e. (3). Interestingly, our analysis reveals
that in the first case above, we indeed can have a parametric rate while in the second case the rate becomes
nonparametric, hence inferior (but does not seem to
rely on the characteristic property of the kernel).

We do not report numerical experiments in this paper
for two reasons: 1). Our main interest is on theoretical
analysis; 2). Exhaustive experimental results on KMM
can already be found in Gretton et al. (2009).

4.2. The empirical version
In this subsection we analyze KMM in details. The
following assumption will be needed:

4. Theoretical Analysis
This section contains our main contribution, i.e., a
theoretical analysis of the KMM estimator for EY te .

Assumption 3 (Compactness assumption) X is
a compact metrizable space, Y ⊆ [0, 1], and the kernel k is continuous, whence kkk∞ ≤ C 2 < ∞.

4.1. The population version
Let us first take a look at the population version of
KMM2 , which is much easier to analyze and provides
valuable insights:

All Hilbert space valued integrals in this paper are to
be understood as the Bochner integral (Yosida, 1980).

H

We use k·k∞ for the supremum norm. Under the above
assumption, the feature map Φ is continuous hence
measurable (with respect to the Borel σ-fields), and
the RKHS is separable, therefore the Bochner integrals
in the previous subsection are well-defined. Moreover,
the conditional probability measure indeed exists under our assumption.
We are now ready to deriveP

in (6), we can apply Hoeffding’s inequality (Hoeffding,

[−β̂i m(Xitr ), β̂i (1 − m(Xitr ))], therefore its range is of
size β̂i . With probability at least 1 − δ,

The second and third terms in (6) require more work.
Consider first the third term:

expectation, and then bound the expectation straightforwardly. In general, Pinelis’s inequality will lead to
(slightly) tighter bounds due to its known optimality
(in certain sense).
Finally, we come to the second term left in (6), which
is roughly the approximation error in learning theory (Cucker & Zhou, 2007). Note that all confidence
bounds we p
have derived so far shrink at the parametric rate O( 1/ntr + 1/nte ). However, from here on
we will have to tolerate nonparametric rates. Since
we are going to apply different approximation error
bounds to the second term in (6), it seems more convenient to collect the results separately. We start with

Pinelis proved his inequality for martingales in any
2-smooth separable Banach space (Hilbert spaces are
bona fide 2-smooth). We remark that another way, see
for instance (Gretton et al., 2009, Lemma 1.5), is to
use McDiarmid’s inequality to bound L̂(β1:ntr ) by its

where M := 1+2CkmkH and β̂i is computed from (3).
Proof: By assumption, setting h = m zeros out the
second term in (6). A standard union bound combining (7)-(10) completes the proof (and we simplified the
bound by slightly worsening the constant).
The confidence bound shrinks at the parametric rate,
although the constant depends on kmkH , which in general is not computable, but can be estimated from the
training sample {(Xitr , Yitr )} at a rate worse than parametric. Since this estimate inevitably introduces other
uncomputable quantities, we omit the relevant discussion. On the other hand, our bound suggests that if
a priori information about m is indeed available, one
should choose a kernel that minimizes its induced norm
on m.
The case when m 6∈ H is less satisfactory, despite of its
practicality. We point out that a denseness argument
cannot resolve this difficulty. To be more precise, let
us assume for a moment m ∈ C (X ) (the space of continuous functions on X ) and k be a universal kernel
(Steinwart, 2002), meaning that the RKHS induced by
k is dense in (C (X ), k · k∞ ). By the assumed universal property of the kernel, there exists suitable h ∈ H
that makes the second term in (6) arbitrarily small (in
fact, can be made vanishing), however, on the other
hand, recall that the bound (9) on the third term in
(6) depends on khkH hence could blow up. If we trade
3
Throughout this paper, the confidence parameter δ is
always taken arbitrarily in (0, 1).

off the two terms appropriately, we might get a rate
that is acceptable (but worse than parametric). The
next theorem concretizes this idea.

this slower rate comes from the irregular nature of the
regression function (in the eye of the kernel k).

The polynomial decay assumption on A2 (m, R) is not
always satisfied, for instance, it is shown in Theorem
Not surprisingly, we apply yet again Hoeffding’s in6.2 of Cucker & Zhou (2007) that for C ∞ (indefinite
equality to relate the last term above to its expectatimes differentiable) kernels (such as the popular Gaustion. Since
sian kernel), polynomial decay implies that the regression function m ∈ C ∞ (X ) (under mild assumptions on

is due to the slow decay of the approximation error
A∞ (m, R). It is proved in Theorem 6.1 of Cucker &
Zhou (2007) that for the Gaussian kernel k(x0 , x) =
exp(−kx − x0 k22 /σ 2 ), if X ⊆ Rd has smooth boundary and the regression function m ∈ H s (X ) with index s > d/2, then the logarithmic decay assumed in
Theorem 3 holds. Here H s (X ) is the Sobolev space
(the completion of C ∞ (X ) under the inner product

hf, gis := X |α|≤s ddxf ddxg , assuming s ∈ N). Similar bounds also hold for the inverse multiquadrics kernel k(x0 , x) = (c2 + kx − x0 k22 )−α with α > 0. We
remark that in this regard Theorem 3 disrespects the
popular Gaussian kernel used ubiquitously in practice
and should draw the attention of researchers.

4.3. Discussion
It seems worthwhile to devote a subsection to discussing a very natural question that the reader might
already have: why not estimate the regression function
m on the training set and then plug into the test set,
after all m does not change under the covariate shift
assumption? Algorithmically, this is perfectly doable,
perhaps conceptually even simpler since the algorithm
does not need to see the test data beforehand. We note
that estimating the regression function from i.i.d. samples has been well studied in the learning theory literature, see for instance, Chapter 8 of Cucker & Zhou
(2007) and the many references therein.
The difficulty, though, lies in the appropriate error
metric on the estimate. Recall that when estimating
the regression function from i.i.d. training samples,
one usually measures the progress (i.e. the discrepancy between the estimate m̂ and m) by the L 2 norm
under the training probability measure Ptr (dx), while
what we really want is a confidence bound on the term

(11)

Since Ptr 6= Pte , there is evidently a probability measure mismatch between the bound we have from estimating m and the true interested quantity. Indeed,
conditioned on the training sample {(Xitr , Yitr )}, using
the triangle inequality we can bound (11) by :
Z
nte
1 X
te
m̂(Xi ) − m̂(x)Pte (dx) + km̂ − mkLP2 .

nte i=1
The first term above can be bounded again through
Hoeffding’s inequality, while the second term is
close to what we usually have from estimating m: the only difference being that the L 2

norm is now under the test probability measure
Pte (dx). Fortunately, since the norm of the identity
map id : ([−1, 1]X , k · kLP2 ) 7→ ([−1, 1]X , k · kLP2 ) is
te

√
bounded by B (see Assumption 2), we can deduce
a bound for (11) based upon results from estimating
m, though less appealingly, a much looser bound than
the one given in Theorem 2. We record such a result
for the purpose of comparison:
Theorem 4 Under Assumptions 1-3, if the regression

probability at least 1 − δ,

where C1 is some constant that does not depend on
ntr , nte , and m̂ is the (regularized least-squares) estimate of m in Smale & Zhou (2007).
The theorem follows from the bound on km̂ − mkLP2
tr
in Corollary 3.2 of Sun & Wu (2009), which is an improvement over Smale & Zhou (2007).
Carefully comparing the current theorem with Theorem 2, we observe: 1). Theorem 4, which is based
on the regularized least-squares estimate of the regression function, needs to know in advance the parameter
θ (in order to tune the regularization constant) while
Theorem 2, derived for KMM, does not require any
such information, hence in some sense KMM is “adaptive”; 2). Theorem 4 has much worse dependence on
the training sample size ntr ; it does not recover the
parametric rate even when the smoothness parameter
−1/4
−1/2
θ goes to ∞ (we get ntr , instead of ntr ). On the
other hand, Theorem 4 has better dependence on the
test sample size nte , which is, however, probably not so
important since usually one has much more test samples than training samples because the lack of labels
make the former much easier to acquire; 3). Theorem
4 seems to have better dependence on the parameter
B; 4). Given the fact that KMM utilizes both the
training data and the test data in the learning phase,
it is not entirely a surprise that KMM wins in terms of
convergence rate, nevertheless, we find it quite stunning that by sacrificing the rate slightly on nte , KMM
is able to improve the rate on ntr so significantly.

5. Conclusion
For estimating the expected value of the output on
the test set where covariate shift has happened, we
have derived high probability confidence bounds for
the kernel mean matching (KMM) estimator, which

provided, calling attention of choosing the right kernel. From the comparison of the bounds, KMM proves
to be much more superior than the plug-in estimator hence provides concrete evidence/understanding to
the effectiveness of KMM under covariate shift.

Although it is unclear to us if it is possible to avoid
approximating the regression function, we suspect the
bound in Theorem 2 is in some sense optimal and we
are currently investigating it. We also plan to generalize our results to the least-squares estimation problem.
