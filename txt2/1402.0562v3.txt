sub-linearly w.r.t. the number of steps n. To obtain this regret, these methods rely heavily on the iid assumption. To
handle the correlated feedback, we introduce a new anytime X -armed bandit algorithm, called high confidence tree
(HCT) (Sect. 3). Similar to the HOO algorithm of Bubeck et al. (2011a), HCT makes use of a covering binary tree
for exploring the arm space. The tree is constructed incrementally in an optimistic fashion, exploring parts of the
arm space guided by upper bounds on the potential best reward of the arms covered within a particular node.
Our key insight is that to achieve good performance it is only necessary to expand the tree by refining an optimistic
node when the estimate of the mean-reward of that node has become sufficiently accurate. This allows us to obtain an
accurate estimate of the return of a particular arm even in the non-iid setting, under some mild ergodicity and mixing
assumptions (Sect. 2). Despite handling a more general case of correlated feedback, our regret bounds matches
(Sect. 4.1) that of HOO (Bubeck et al., 2011a) and zooming algorithm (Kleinberg et al., 2008), both of which only
apply to iid setting, in terms of dependency on the number of steps n and the near-optimality dimension d (to be
defined later). Furthermore, HCT also requires milder assumptions on the smoothness of the function, which is
required to be Lipschitz only w.r.t. the maximum, whereas HOO assumes the mean-reward to be Lipschitz also
between any pair of arms close to the maximum. An important part of our proof of this result (though we delay
this and all proofs to the supplement, due to space considerations) is the development of concentration inequalities
for non-iid episodic random variables. In addition to this main result, the structure of our HCT approach has a
favorable sub-linear space complexity of O(nd/(d+2) (log n)2/(d+2) ) and a linearithmic runtime complexity, making
it suitable for scaling to big data scenarios. These results meet or improve the space and time complexity of prior
work designed for iid data (Sect. 4.2), and we will demonstrate this benefit in simulations (Sect. 6). We also show
how our approach can lead to finite-sample guarantees for policy search method, and provide preliminary simulation
results which show the advantage of our method in the case of MDPs.

2 Preliminaries
The optimization problem. Let X be a measurable space of arms. We formalize the optimization problem as an
interaction between the learner and the environment. At each time step t, the learner pulls an arm xt in X and
the environment returns a reward rt ∈ [0, 1] and possibly a context yt ∈ Y, with Y a measurable space (e.g., the
state space of a Markov decision process). Whenever needed, we relate rt to the arm pulled by using the notation
rt (x). The context yt and the reward rt may depend on the history of all previous rewards, pulls, contexts and the
current pull xt . For any time step t > 0, the space of histories Ht := ([0, 1] × X × Y)t is defined as the space
of past rewards, arms,and observations (with H0 = ∅). An environment M corresponds to an infinite sequence of
time-dependent probability measures M = (Q1 , Q2 , . . . ), such that each Qt : Ht−1 × X → M([0, 1] × Y) is a
mapping from the history Ht−1 and the arm space X to the space of probability measures on rewards and contexts.
Let Z = ([0, 1] × X × Y), at each step t we define the random variable zt = (rt , xt , yt ) ∈ Z and we introduce
the filtration Ft as a σ-algebra generated by (z1 , z2 , . . . , zt ). At each step t, the arm xt is Ft−1 -measurable since it
is based on all the information available up to time t − 1. The pulling strategy of the learner can be expressed as
an infinite sequence of measurable mappings (ψ1 , ψ2 , . . . ), where ψt : Ht−1 → M(X ) maps Ht−1 to the space of
probability measures on arms. We refine this general setting with two assumptions on the reward-generating process.
Definition 1 (Time average reward). For any x ∈ X , S > 0 and 0 < s ≤ S, the time average reward is
S
X
1
rs′ (x).
r̄s→S (x) :=
S−s+1 ′

(1)

s =s

We now state our first assumption which guarantees that the mean of the process is well defined (ergodicity).
Assumption 1 (Ergodicity). For any x ∈ X , any s > 0 and any sequence of prior pulls (x1 , x2 , . . . , xs−1 ), the
process (zt )t>0 is such that the mean-reward function
2

f (x) := lim S→∞ E(r̄s→S (x)|Fs−1 )
exists.
This assumption implies that, regardless of the history of prior observations, if arm x is pulled infinitely many times
from time s, then the time average reward converges in expectation to a fixed point which only depends on arm x and
is independent from the past history. We also make the following mixing assumption (see e.g., Levin et al., 2006).
Assumption 2 (Finite mixing time). There exists a constant Γ ≥ 0 (mixing time) such that for any x ∈ X , any
S > 0, any 0 < s ≤ S and any sequence of prior pulls (x1 , x2 , . . . , xs−1 ), the process (zt )t>0 is such that we have
that
X
S
|E[
s′ =s (rs′ (x) − f (x)) Fs−1 ]| ≤ Γ.

(2)

This assumption implies that the stochastic reward process induced by pulling arm x can not substantially deviate
from f (x) in expectation for more than Γ transient steps. Note that both assumptions trivially hold if each arm is an
iid process: in this case f (x) is the mean of x and Γ = 0.
Given the mean-reward f , we assume that the maximizer x∗ = arg maxx f (x) exists and we denote the corresponding maximum f (x∗ ) by f ∗ . We measure the performance of the learner over n steps by its regret Rn w.r.t. the f ∗ ,
defined as
∗

Rn := nf −

n
X

rt .

t=1

The goal of learner, at every 0 ≤ t ≤ n, is to choose a strategy ψt such that the regret Rn is as small as possible.
Relationship to other models. Although the learner observes a context yt at each time t, this problem differs
from the contextual bandit setting (see e.g., the extensions of the zooming algorithm to contextual bandits by
Slivkins, 2009). In contextual bandits, the context y ∈ Y is provided before selecting an arm x, and the immediate
reward rt is defined to be a function only of the selected arm and input context, rt (x, y). The contextual bandit
objective is typically to minimize the regret against the optimal arm in the context provided at each step, yt , i.e.
x∗t = arg max rt (x, yt ). A key difference is that in our model the reward, and next context, may depend on the
entire history of rewards, arms pulled, and contexts, instead of only the current context and arm, and we define
f (x) only as the average reward obtained by pulling arm x. In this sense, our model is related to the reinforcement
learning (RL) problem of trying to find a policy that maximizes the long run reward (see further discussion in Sect. 5).
Among prior work in RL our setting is most similar to the general reinforcement learning model of Lattimore et al.
(2013) which also considers an arbitrary temporal dependence between the rewards and observations. Our setting
differs from that of Lattimore et al. (2013), since we consider the regret in undiscounted reward scenario, whereas
Lattimore et al. (2013) focus on proving PAC-bounds in discounted reward case. Another difference is that in our
model (unlike Lattimore et al., 2013) the space of observations and actions is not needed to be finite.
The cover tree. Similar to recent optimization methods (e.g., Bubeck et al., 2011a), our approach seeks to minimize
regret by smartly building an estimate of f using an infinite binary covering tree T , in which each node covers a
subset of X .1 We denote by (h, i) the node at depth h and index i among the nodes at the same depth (e.g., the root
node which covers X is indexed by (0, 1)). By convention (h + 1, 2i − 1) and (h + 1, 2i) refer to the two children
of the node (h, i). The area corresponding to each node (h, i) is denoted by Ph,i ⊂ X . These regions must be
measurable and, at each depth, they partition X with no overlap:

The reader is referred to Bubeck et al. (2011a) for a more detailed description of the covering tree.

P0,1 = X

∀h ≥ 0 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 2h .

Ph,i = Ph+1,2i−1 ∪ Ph,2i

For each node (h, i), we define an arm xh,i ∈ Ph,i , which the algorithm pulls whenever the node (h, i) is selected.
We now state a few additional geometrical assumptions.
Assumption 3 (Dissimilarity). The space X is equipped with a dissimilarity function ℓ : X 2 → R such that
ℓ(x, x′ ) ≥ 0 for all (x, x′ ) ∈ X 2 and ℓ(x, x) = 0.
Given a dissimilarity ℓ, the diameter of a subset A ⊆ X is defined as diam(A) := supx,y∈A ℓ(x, y), while an ℓ–open
ball of radius ε > 0 and center x ∈ X is defined as B(x, ε) := {x′ ∈ X : ℓ(x, x′ ) ≤ ε}.
Assumption 4 (local smoothness). We assume that there exist constants ν2 , ν1 > 0 and 0 < ρ < 1 such that for all
nodes (h, i):
(a) diam(Ph,i ) ≤ ν1 ρh
(b) ∃ xoh,i ∈ Ph,i s.t. Bh,i := B(xoh,i , ν2 ρh ) ⊂ Ph,i ,
(c) Bh,i ∩ Bh,j = ∅,
(d) For all x ∈ X , f ∗ − f (x) ≤ ℓ(x∗ , x).
Local smoothness. These assumptions coincide with those in (Bubeck et al., 2011a), except for the local smoothness
(Assumption 4.d), which is weaker than that of Bubeck et al. (2011a), where the function is assumed to be Lipschitz
between any two arms x, x′ close to the maximum x∗ (i.e., |f (x) − f (x′ )| ≤ ℓ(x, x′ )), while here we only require
the function to be Lipschitz w.r.t. the maximum.
Finally, we characterize the complexity of the problem using the near-optimality dimension, which defines how large
is the set of ǫ-optimal arms in X . For the sake of clarity, we consider a slightly simplified definition of near-optimality
dimension w.r.t. Bubeck et al. (2011a).
Assumption 5 (Near-optimality dimension). Let ǫ = 3ν1 ρh and ǫ′ = ν2 ρh < ǫ, for any
 subset of ǫ-optimal nodes
Xǫ = {x ∈ X : f ∗ − f (x) ≤ ǫ}, there exists a constant C such that N Xǫ , ℓ, ǫ′ ≤ C(ǫ′ )−d , where d is the
near-optimality dimension of function f and N (Xǫ , ℓ, ǫ′ ) is the ǫ′ -cover number of the set Xǫ w.r.t. the dissimilarity
measure ℓ.2

3 The High Confidence Tree algorithm
We now introduce the High Confidence Tree (HCT) algorithm for stochastic online optimization under bandit feedback. Throughout this discussion, a function evaluation is equivalent to the reward received from pulling an arm
(since an arm corresponds to selecting an input to evaluate the function at). We first describe the general algorithm
framework before discussing two particular variants: HCT-iid, designed for the case when rewards of a given arm
are iid and HCT-Γ which handles the correlated feedback case, where the reward from pulling an arm may depend
on all prior arms pulled and resulting outcomes. Alg. 1 shows the structure of the algorithm for HCT-iid and HCT-Γ,
noting the minor modifications between the two.
2
Note that, in many cases, the near-optimality dimension d can be much smaller than D, the actual dimension of arm space X in the
continuous case. In fact one can show that under some mild smoothness assumption the near optimality dimension of a function equals 0,
regardless of the dimension of its input space X (see Munos, 2013; Valko et al., 2013, for a detailed discussion).

The general structure. The HCT algorithm relies on a binary covering tree T provided as input used to construct a
hierarchical approximation of the mean-reward function f . At each node (h, i) of the tree, the algorithm keeps track
of some statistics regarding the corresponding arm xh,i associated with the node (h, i). These include the empirical

where Th,i (t) is the number of times node (h, i) has been selected in the past and r s (xh,i ) denotes the s-th reward
observed after pulling xh,i (while we previously used rt to denote the t-th sample of the overall process). As
explained in Sect. 2, although a node is associated to a single arm xh,i , it also covers a full portion of the input
space X , i.e., the subset Ph,i . Thus, similar to the HOO algorithm (Bubeck et al., 2011a), HCT also maintains two
upper-bounds, Uh,i and Bh,i , which are meant to bound the mean-reward f (x) of all the arms x ∈ Ph,i . In particular,
for any node (h, i), the upper-bound Uh,i is computed directly from the observed reward for pulling xh,i as

where t+ = 2⌊log(t)⌋+1 and δ̃(t) := min{c1 δ/t, 1}. Intuitively speaking, the second term is related to the resolution
of node (h, i) and the third term accounts for the uncertainty of µ
bh,i (t) in estimating the mean-reward f (xh,i ). The
B-values are designed to have a tighter upper bound on f (x) by taking the minimum between Uh,i for the current
node, and the maximum upper bound of the node’s two child nodes, if present.3 More precisely,

Bh,i (t) =

otherwise.

To identify which arm to pull, the algorithm traverses the tree along a path Pt obtained by selecting nodes with
maximum Bh,i until it reaches an optimistic node (ht , it ), which is either a leaf or a node which is not pulled
3

Since the node’s children together contain the same input space as the node (i.e., Ph,i = Ph+1,2i−1 ∪ Ph,2i ), the node’s maximum
cannot be greater than the maximum of its children.

6

enough w.r.t. to a given threshold τh (t), i.e., Th,i (t) ≤ τh (t) (see function OptTraverse in Alg. 2). Then the arm
xht ,it ∈ Pht ,it corresponding to selected node (ht , it ) is pulled.
The key step of HCT is in deciding when to expand the tree. We expand a leaf node only if we have pulled its
corresponding arm a sufficient number of times such that the uncertainty over the maximum value of the arms
contained within that node is dominated by size of the subset of X it covers. Recall from Equation 4 that the upper
bound Uh,i of a node (h, i) two additional terms added to the empirical average reward. The first ν1 ρh is a constant
that depends only on the node depth, and bounds the possible difference in the mean-reward function between the
representative arm for this node and all other arms also contained in this node, i.e., the difference between f (xh,i )
and f (x) for any other x ∈ Ph,i (as follows from Assumptions 3 and 4). The second term depends only on t and
decreases with the number of pulls to this node. At some point, the second term will become smaller than the first
term, meaning that the uncertainty over the possible rewards of nodes in Ph,i becomes dominated by the potential
difference in rewards amongst arms that are contained within the same node. This means that the domain Ph,i is too
large, and thus the resolution of the current approximation of f in that region needs to be increased. Therefore our
approach chooses the point at which these two terms become of the same magnitude to expand a node, which occurs
when the the number of pulls Tht ,it (t) has exceeded a threshold

τh (t) := c2 log(1/δ̃(t+ ))ρ−2ht /ν12 .

(6)

(see Sect. A of the supplement for further discussion). It is at this point that expanding the node to two children can
lead to a more accurate approximation of f (x), since ν1 ρh+1 ≤ ν1 ρh . Therefore if Tht ,it (t) ≥ τh (t), the algorithm
expands the leaf, creates both children leaves, and set their U -values to +∞. Furthermore, notice that this expansion
only occurs for nodes which are likely to contain x∗ . In fact, OptTraverse does select nodes with big B-value, which
in turn receive more pulls and are thus expanded first. The selected arm xht ,it is pulled either for a single time step
(in HCT-iid) or for a full episode (in HCT-Γ), and then the statistics of all the nodes along the optimistic path Pt are
updated backwards. The statistics of all the nodes outside the optimistic path remain unchanged.
As HCT is an anytime algorithm, we periodically need to recalculate the node upper bounds to guarantee their validity with enough probability (see supplementary material for a more precise discussion). To do so, at the beginning of
each step t, the algorithm verifies whether the B and U values need to be refreshed or not. In fact, in the definition
of U in Eq. 4, the uncertainty term depends on the confidence δ̃(t+ ), which changes at t = 1, 2, 4, 8, . . .. Refreshing
the U and B values triggers a “resampling phase” of the internal nodes of the tree Tt along the optimistic path. In
fact, the second condition in the OptTraverse function (Alg. 2) forces HCT to pull arms that belong to the current
optimistic path Pt until the number of pulls Th,i (t) becomes greater than τh (t) again. Notice that the choice of the
confidence term δ̃ is particularly critical. For instance, choosing a more natural δ̃(t) would tend to trigger the refresh
(and the resampling) phase too often thus increasing the computational complexity of the algorithm and seriously
affecting its theoretical properties in the correlated feedback scenario. 4 On the other hand, the choice of δ̃(t+ )
limits the need to refresh the U and B values to only O(log(n)) times over n rounds and guarantees that U and B
are valid upper bounds with high probability.
HCT-iid and HCT-Γ. The main difference between the two implementations of HCT is that, while HCT-iid pulls
the selected arm for only one step before re-traversing the tree from the root to again find another optimistic node,
HCT-Γ pulls the the representative arm of the optimistic node for an episode of Tcur steps, where Tcur is the number
of pulls of arm xh,i at the beginning of episode. In other words, the algorithm doubles the number of pulls of each
arm throughout the episode. Note that not all the episodes may actually finish after Tcur steps and double the number
of pulls: The algorithm may interrupt the episode when the confidence bounds of B and U are not valid anymore
(i.e., t ≥ t+ ) and perform a refresh phase.
The reason for this change is that in order to accurately estimate the mean-reward given correlated bandit feedback,
4

If we refresh the upper-bound statistics at every time step the algorithm may select a different arm at every time step, whereas in correlated
feedback scenario having a small number of switches is critical for the convergence of the algorithm.

7

it is necessary to pull an arm for a series of pulls rather than a single pull. Due to our assumption on the mixing
time (Assumption. 2), pulling an arm for a sufficiently long sequence will provide an accurate estimate of the
potential mean reward even in the correlated setting, thus ensuring that the empirical average rewards µ
bh,i actually
concentrates towards their mean value (see Lem. 7 in the supplementary material). It is this mechanism, coupled with
only expanding the nodes after obtaining a good estimate of their mean reward, that allows us to handle correlated
feedback setting. Although in this sense HCT-Γ is more general, we do however include the HCT-iid variant because
whenever the rewards are iid it performs better than HCT-Γ. This is due to the fact that, unlike HCT-iid, HCT-Γ
has to keep pulling an arm for a full episode even when there is evidence that another arm could be better. We also
notice p
that there is a small difference
in the constants c1 and c betweenp
HCT-iid and HCT-Γ: in the case
p
p of HCT-iid
c1 := 8 ρ/(3ν1 ) and c := 2 1/(1 − ρ), whereas HCT-Γ uses c1 := 9 ρ/(4ν1 ) and c := 3(3Γ + 1) 1/(1 − ρ).

4 Theoretical Analysis
In this section we analyze the regret and the complexity of HCT. All the proofs are reported in the supplement.

4.1 Regret Analysis
We start by reporting a bound on the maximum depth of the trees generated by HCT.
Lemma 1. Given the threshold τh (t) in Eq. 6, the depth H(n) of the tree Tn is bounded as
H(n) ≤ Hmax (n) = 1/(1 − ρ) log(nν12 /(2(cρ)2 )).

(7)

This bound guarantees that HCT never expands trees beyond depth O(log n). This is ensured by the fact the HCT
waits until the value of a node f (xh,i ) is sufficiently well estimated before expanding it and this implies that the
number of pulls exponentially grows with the depth of tree, thus preventing the depth to grow linearly as in HOO.
We report regret bounds in high probability, bounds in expectation can be obtained using standard techniques.
Theorem 1 (Regret bound of HCT-iid). Pick a δ ∈ (0, 1). Assume that at each step t, the reward rt , conditioned
on xt , is independent of all prior random events and the immediate mean reward f (x) = E(r|x) exists for every
x ∈ X . Then under Assumptions 3–5 the regret of HCT-iid in n steps is, with probability (w.p.) 1 − δ,5
Rn ≤ O

log (n/δ)

1/(d+2)


n(d+1)/(d+2) .

Remark (the bound). We notice that the bound perfectly matches the bound for HOO up to constants (see Thm. 6
in (Bubeck et al., 2011a)). This represents a first sanity check w.r.t. the structure of HCT, since it shows that changing
the structure of HOO and expanding nodes only when they are pulled enough, preserves the regret properties of the
algorithm. Furthermore, this result holds under milder assumptions than HOO. In fact, Assumption 4-(d) only
requires f to be Lipschitz w.r.t. to the maximum x∗ . Other advantages of HCT-iid are discussed in the Sect. 4.2
and 6.
Although the proof is mostly based on standard techniques and tools from bandit literature, HCT has a different
structure from HOO (and similar algorithms) and moving from iid to correlated arms calls for the development of a
significantly different proof technique. The main technical issue is to show that the empirical average µ
bh,i computed
by averaging rewards obtained across different episodes actually converges to f (xh,i ). In particular, we prove the
following high-probability concentration inequality (see Lem. 7 in the supplement for further details).

Constants are provided in Sect. A of the supplement.

Furthermore Kh,i (t), the number of episodes in which (h, i) is selected, is bounded by log2 (4Th,i (t)) + log2 (t).
This technical lemma is at the basis of the derivation of the following regret bound for HCT-Γ.
Theorem 2 (Regret bound of HCT-Γ). We assume that Assumptions 1–5 hold and that rewards are generated
according to the general model defined in Section 2. Then the regret of HCT-iid after n steps is, w.p. 1 − δ,

Remark (the bound). The most interesting aspect of this bound is that HCT-Γ achieves the same regret as HCT-iid
when samples are non-iid. This represents a major step forward w.r.t. HOO since it shows that the very general case
of correlated arms can be managed as well as the much simpler iid case. In the next section we also discuss how this
result can be used in policy search for MDPs.

4.2 Complexity
Time complexity. The run time complexity of both versions of HCT is O(n log(n)). This is due to the boundedness
of the depth H(n) and by the structure of the refresh phase. By Lem. 1, we have that the maximum depth is
O(log(n)). As a result, at each step t, the cost of traversing the tree to select a node is at most O(log n), which also
coincides with the cost of updating the B and U values of the nodes in the optimistic path Pt . Thus, the total cost
of selecting, pulling, and updating nodes is no larger than O(n log n). Notice that in case of HCT-Γ, once a node is
selected is pulled for an entire episode, which further reduces the total selection cost. Another computational cost is
represented by the refresh phase where all the nodes in the tree are actually updated. Since the refresh is performed
only when t = t+ , then the number of times all the nodes are refreshed is of order of O(log n) and the boundedness
of the depth guarantees that the number of nodes to update cannot be larger than O(2log n ), which still corresponds
to a total cost of O(n log n). This implies that HCT achieves the same run time as T-HOO (Bubeck et al., 2011a).
Though unlike T-HOO, our algorithm is fully anytime and it does not suffer from the extra regret incurred due to the
truncation and the doubling trick.
Space complexity. The following theorem provides bound on space complexity of the HCT algorithm.
Theorem 3. Under the same conditions of Thm. 2, let Nn denote the space complexity of HCT-Γ, then we have that
E(Nn ) = O(log(n)2/(d+2) nd/(d+2) ).
The previous theorem guarantees that the space complexity of HCT scales sub-linearly w.r.t. n. An important
e 1/(d+2) ), than its regret. This
observation is that the space complexity of HCT increases slower, by a factor of O(n
implies that, for small values of d, HCT does not require to use a large memory space to achieve a good performance.
An interesting special case is the class of problem with near-optimality dimension d = 0. For this class of problems
the bound translates to a space complexity of O(log(n)), whereas the space complexity of alternative algorithms
may be as large as n (see e.g., HOO). As it has been shown in (Valko et al., 2013) the case of d = 0 covers a rather
large class of functions, since every function which satisfies some mild local smoothness assumption, around its
9

global optima, has a near-optimality dimension equal to 0 (see Valko et al., 2013, for further discussions). The fact
that HCT can achieve a near-optimal performance, using only a relatively small memory space, which makes it a
suitable choice for big-data applications, where the algorithms with linear space complexity can not be used due to
very large size of the dataset.
Switching frequency. Finally, we also remark another interesting feature of HCT-Γ. Since an arm is pulled for an
entire episode before another arm could be selected, this drastically reduces the number of switches between arms.
In many applications, notably in reinforcement learning (see next section), this can be a significant advantage since
pulling an arm may correspond to the actual implementation of a complex solution (e.g., a position in a portfolio
management problem) and continuously switch between different arms might not be feasible. More formally, since
each node has a number of episodes bounded by O(log n) (Lem. 2), then the number of switches can be derived be
the number of nodes in Thm. 3 multiplied by O(log n), which leads to O(log(n)(d+4)/(d+2) nd/(d+2) ).

5 Application to Policy Search in MDPs
As we discussed in Sect. 2, HCT is designed to handle the very general case of optimization in problems where there
exists a strong correlation among the rewards, arm pulls, and contexts, at different time steps. An important subset
of this general class is represented by the problem of policy search in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes.
Notice that the extension to the case of partially observable MDPs is straightforward as long as the POMDP satisfies
some ergodicity assumptions.
A MDP M is defined as a tuple hS, A, P i where S is the set of states, A is the set of actions, P : S × A →
M(S × [0, 1]) is the transition kernel mapping each state-action pair to a distribution over states and rewards. A
(stochastic) policy π : S → M(A) is a mapping from states to distribution over actions. Policy search algorithms
(Scherrer & Geist, 2013; Azar et al., 2013; Kober & Peters, 2011) aim at finding the policy in a given policy set
which maximizes the long-term performance. Formally, a policy search algorithm receives as input a set of policies
G = {πθ ; θ ∈ Θ}, each of them parameterized by a parameter vector θ in a given set Θ ⊂ ℜd . Any policy πθ ∈ G
induces a state-reward transition kernel T : S × Θ → M(S × [0, 1]). T relates to the state-reward-action transition
kernel P and the policy kernel πθ as follows
′

T (ds , dr|s, θ) :=

Z

P (ds′ , dr|s, u)πθ (du|s).
u∈A

For any πθ ∈ G and initial state s0 ∈ S, the time-average reward over n steps is
µπθ (s0 , n) :=

i
1 hXn
E
rt ,
t=1
n

where r1 , r2 , . . . , rn is the sequence of rewards observed by running πθ for n steps staring at s0 . If the Markov
reward process induced by πθ is ergodic, µπθ (s0 , n) converges to a fixed point independent of the initial state s0 .
The average reward of πθ is thus defined as
µ(θ) := lim µπθ (s0 , n).
n→∞

The goal of policy search is to find the best θ ∗ = arg maxθ∈Θ µ(θ). Note that πθ∗ is optimal in the policy class G
and it may not coincide with the optimal policy π ∗ of the MDP, when π ∗ is not covered by G.
It is straightforward now to match the MDP scenario to the general setting in Sect. 2, notably mapping Θ to X and
µ(θ) to f (x). More precisely the parameter space θ ∈ Θ corresponds to the space of arms X , since in the policy
search we want to explore the parameter space Θ to learn the best parameter θ ∗ . Also the state space S in MDP
10

setting is the special from of context space of Sect. 2 where here the contexts evolve according to some controlled
Markov process. Further the transition kernel T , which at each time step t determines the distribution on the current
state and reward given the last state and θ is again a special case of of the more general (Qt )t which may depend
on the entire history of prior observations. Likewise µ(θ), µ∗Θ and θ ∗ translate into f (θ), f ∗ and x∗ , respectively,
using the notation of Sect. 2. The Asm. 1 and 2 in Sect. 2 are also the general version of the standard ergodicity and
mixing assumption in MDPs, in which the notion of filtration in assumptions of Sect. 2 is simply replaced by the the
initial state s0 ∈ S.
This allows us to directly apply HCT-Γ to the problem of policy search. The advantage of HCT-Γ algorithm w.r.t.
prior work is that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first policy search algorithm which provides finite sample
guarantees in the form of regret bounds on the performance loss of policy search in MDPs (see Thm. 2), which
guarantee that HCT-Γ suffers from a small sub-linear regret w.r.t. πθ∗ . Also it is not difficult to prove that the policy
induced by HCT-Γ has a small simple regret, that is, the average reward of the policy chosen by HCT-Γ converges to
µ(θ ∗ ) with a polynomial rate.6 Another interesting feature of HCT-Γ is that can be readily used in large (continuous)
state-action problems since it does not make any restrictive assumption on the size of state-action space.
Prior regret bounds for continuous MDPs. A related work to HCT-Γ is the UCCRL algorithm by Ortner & Ryabko
(2012), which extends the original UCRL algorithm (Jaksch et al., 2010) to continuous state spaces. Although a direct comparison between the two methods is not possible, it is interesting to notice that the assumptions used in
UCCRL are stronger than for HCT-Γ, since they require both the dynamics and the reward function to be globally
Lipschitz. Furthermore, UCCRL requires the action space to be finite, while HCT-Γ can deal with any continuous
policy space. Finally, while HCT-Γ is guaranteed to minimize the regret against the best policy in the policy class
G, UCCRL targets the performance of the actual optimal policy of the MDP at hand. Another relevant work is the
OMDP algorithm of Abbasi et al. (2013) which deals with the problem of RL in continuous state-action MDPs with
adversarial rewards. OMDP achieves a sub-linear regret under the assumption that the space of policies is finite,
whereas in HCT the space of policy can be continuous.

6 Numerical Results
While our primary contribution is the definition of HCT and its technical analysis, we also give some preliminary
simulation results to demonstrate some of its properties.
Setup. We
p focus on minimizing the regret across repeated noisy evaluations of the garland function f (x) = x(1 −
x)(4 − | sin(60x)|) relative to repeatedly selecting its global optima.We select this function due to its several
interesting properties: (1) it contains many local optima, (2) it is locally smooth around its global optima x∗ (it
behaves as f ∗ − c|x − x∗ |α , for c = 2 and α = 1/2), (3) it is also possible to show that the near-optimality
dimension d of f equals 0.
en = Rn /n. Each run is n = 105
We evaluate the performances of each algorithm in terms of the per-step regret, R
steps and we average the performance on 10 runs. For all the algorithms compared in the following, parameters7 are
optimized to maximize their performance.
I.i.d. setting. For our first experiment
we compare HCT-iid to the truncated hierarchical optimistic optimization (T-HOO) algorithm Bubeck et al. (2011a).
T-HOO is a state-of-the-art X -armed bandit algorithm, developed as a computationally-efficient alternative of HOO.
In Fig. 1(a) we show the per-step regret, the runtime, and the space requirements of each approach. As predicted

by the theoretical bounds, the per-step regret R

For both HCT and T-HOO we introduce a tuning parameter used to multiply the upper bounds, while for PoWER we optimize the
window for computing the weighted average.

example that HCT-iid outperforms T-HOO by a large margin. Similarly, though the computational complexity of
both approaches matches in the dependence on the number of time steps, empirically we observe that our approach
outperforms T-HOO (Fig. 1(b)). Perhaps the most significant expected advantage of HCT-iid over T-HOO for iid
settings is in the space requirements. HCT-iid has a space requirement for this domain that scales logarithmically
with the time step n, as predicted by Thm. 3. since the near-optimality dimension d = 0). In contrast, a brief analysis
of T-HOO suggests that its space requirements can grow polynomially, and indeed in this domain we observe a
polynomial growth of memory usage for T-HOO. These patterns mean that HCT-iid can achieve a very small regret
using a sparse decision tree with only few hundred nodes, whereas truncated HOO requires orders of magnitude
more nodes than HCT-iid.
Correlated setting. We create a continuous-state-action MDP out of the previously described Garland function by
introducing the state of the environment s. Upon taking continuous-valued action x, the state of the environment
changes deterministically to st+1 = (1 − β)st + βx, where we set β = 0.2. The agent receives a stochastic
reward for being in state s, which is (the Garland function) f (s) + ε, where as before ε is drawn randomly from
[0, 1]. The initial state s0 is also drawn randomly from [0, 1]. A priori, the agent does not know the transition or
reward function, making this a reinforcement learning problem. Though not a standard benchmark RL instance, this
problem has multiple local optima and therefore is a interesting case for policy search, where Θ = X is the policy
set (which coincides with the action set in this case).
In this setting, we compare HCT-Γ to a PoWER, a standard RL policy search algorithm Kober & Peters (2011)
on the above MDP problem MDP constructed out of garland function.PoWER uses an Expectation Maximization
approach to optimize the policy parameters and is therefore not guaranteed to find the global optima. We also
compare our algorithm with T-HOO, though this algorithm is specifically designed for iid setting and one may
expect that it may fail to converge to global optima under correlated bandit feedback. Fig. 2(a) shows per-step regret
of the 3 approaches in the MDP. Only HCT-Γ succeeds in finding the globally optimal policy, as is evident because
only in the case of HCT-Γ does the average regret tends to converge to zero (which is as predicted from Thm. 2).
The PoWER method finds worse solutions than both stochastic optimization approaches for the same amount of
computational time, likely due to using EM which is known to be susceptible to local optima. On the other hand, its
primary advantage is that it has a very small memory requirement. Overall this suggests the benefit of our proposed
approach to be used for online MDP policy search, since it quickly (as a function of samples and runtime) can find
a global optima, and is, to our knowledge, one of the only policy search methods guaranteed to do so.

7 Discussion and Future Work
In the current version of HCT we assume that the learner has access to the information regarding the smoothness
of function f (x) and the mixing time Γ. In many problems those information are not available to the learner. In
the future it would be interesting to build on prior work that handles unknown smoothness in iid settings and extend
it to correlated feedback. For example, Bubeck et al. (2011b) require a stronger global Lipschitz assumption and
propose an algorithm to estimate the Lipschitz constant. Other work on the iid setting include Valko et al. (2013)
and Munos (2011), which are limited to the simple regret scenario, but who only use the mild local smoothness
assumption we define in Asm. 4, and do not require knowledge of the dissimilarity measure ℓ. On the other hand,
Slivkins (2011) and Bull (2013) study the cumulative regret but consider a different definition of smoothness related
to the zooming concept introduced by Kleinberg et al. (2008). Finally, we notice that to deal with unknown mixing
time, one may rely on data-dependent tail’s inequalities, such as empirical Bernstein inequality (Tolstikhin & Seldin,
2013; Maurer & Pontil, 2009), replacing the mixing time with the empirical variance of the rewards.
In the future we also wish to explore using HCT to optimize other problems that can be modeled using correlated bandit feedback. For example, HCT may be used for policy search in partially observable MDPs (Vlassis & Toussaint,
2009; Baxter & Bartlett, 2000), as long as the POMDP is ergodic.
To conclude, in this paper we introduce a new X -armed bandit algorithm, called HCT, for optimization under bandit
feedback and prove regret bounds and simulation results for it. Our approach improves on existing results to handle
the important case of correlated bandit feedback. This allows HCT to be applied to a broader range of problems
than prior X -armed bandit algorithms, such as we demonstrate by using it to perform policy search for continuous
MDPs.

Appendices
A

Proof of Thm. 1

In this section we report the full proof of the regret bound of HCT-iid.
We begin by introducing some additional notation, required for the analysis of both algorithms. We denote the
indicator function of an event E by IE . For all 1 ≤ h ≤ H(t) and t > 0, we denote by Ih (t) the set of all nodes
created by the algorithm at depth h up to time t and by Ih+ (t) the subset of Ih (t) including only the internal nodes
(i.e., nodes that are not leaves), which corresponds to nodes at depth h which have been expanded before time t. At
each time step t, we denote by (ht , it ) the node selected by the algorithm. For every (h, i) ∈ T , we define the set of
time steps when (h, i) has been selected as Ch,i := {t = 1, . .S
. , n : (ht , it ) = (h, i)}. We also define the set of times
c := C
Ch+1,2i . We need to introduce three important steps
that a child of (h, i) has been selected as Ch,i
h+1,2i−1
related to node (h, i):
• t̄h,i := maxt∈Ch,i t is the last time (h, i) has been selected,
c t is the last time when any of the two children of (h, i) has been selected,
• t̃h,i := maxt∈Ch,i

• th,i := min{t : Th,i (t) > τh (t)} is the step when (h, i) is expanded.
The choice of τh . The threshold on the the number of pulls needed before expanding a node at depth h is determined

14

where we used the fact that 0 < δ̃(t) ≤ 1 for all t > 0. As described in Section 3, the idea is that the expansion of
a node, which corresponds to an increase in the resolution of the approximation of f , should not be performed until
the empirical estimate µ
bh,i of f (xh,i ) is accurate enough. Notice that the number of pulls Th,i (t) for an expanded
node (h, i) does not necessarily coincide with τh (t), since t might correspond to a time step when some leaves have
not been pulled until τh (t) and other nodes have not been fully resampled after a refresh phase.
We begin our analysis by bounding the maximum depth of the trees constructed by HCT-iid.
Lemma 1 Given the number of samples τh (t) required for the expansion of nodes at depth h in Eq. 6, the depth
H(n) of the tree Tn is bounded as

Proof. The deepest tree that can be developed by HCT-iid is a linear tree, where at each depth h only one node is
expanded, that is , |Ih+ (n)| = 1 and |Ih (n)| = 2 for all h < H(n). Thus we have

sum by its last element (h = H(n)), which is 1, and obtain

We now introduce a high probability event under which the mean reward for all the expanded nodes is within a
confidence interval of the empirical estimates at a fixed time t.

Step 2: Preliminary bound on the regret of selected nodes and their parents. We now proceed with the study
enE , which refers to the regret of the selected nodes as measured by its mean-reward. We start by
of the first term R
characterizing which nodes are actually selected by the algorithm under event Et . Let (ht , it ) be the node chosen
at time t and Pt be the path from the root to the selected node. Let (h′ , i′ ) ∈ Pt and (h′′ , i′′ ) be the node which
immediately follows (h′ , i′ ) in Pt (i.e., h′′ = h′ + 1). By definition of B and U values, we have that
h

i
Bh′ ,i′ (t) = min Uh′ ,i′ (t); max Bh′ +1,2i′ −1 (t); Bh′ +1,2i′ (t) ≤ max Bh′ +1,2i′ −1 (t); Bh′ +1,2i′ (t) = Bh′′ ,i′′ (t),
(12)

where the last equality follows from the fact that the OptTraverse function selects the node with the largest B value.
By iterating the previous inequality for all the nodes in Pt until the selected node (ht , it ) and its parent (hpt , ipt ), we
obtain that
Bh′ ,i′ (t) ≤ Bht ,it (t) ≤ Uht ,it (t),

Bh′ ,i′ (t) ≤ Bhpt ,ipt (t) ≤ Uhpt ,ipt (t),

∀(h′ , i′ ) ∈ Pt

∀(h′ , i′ ) ∈ Pt − (ht , it )

by definition of B-values. Thus for any node (h, i) ∈ Pt }, we have that Uht ,it (t) ≥ Bh,i (t). Furthermore, since the
root node (0, 1) which covers the whole arm space X is in Pt , thus there exists at least one node (h∗ , i∗ ) in the set
Pt which includes the maximizer x∗ (i.e., x∗ ∈ Ph∗ ,i∗ ) and has the the depth h∗ ≤ hpt < ht .8 Thus
Uht ,it (t) ≥ Bh∗ ,i∗ (t).

(13)

Uhpt ,ipt (t) ≥ Bh∗ ,i∗ (t)

Notice that in the set Pt we may have multiple nodes (h∗ , i∗ ) which contain x∗ and that for all of them we have the
following sequence of inequalities holds
∗

f ∗ − f (xh∗ ,i∗ ) ≤ ℓ(x∗ , xh∗ ,i∗ ) ≤ diam(Ph∗ ,i∗ ) ≤ ν1 ρh ,

(14)

where the second inequality holds since x∗ ∈ Ph∗ ,i∗ .
Now we expand the inequality in Eq. 13 on both sides using the high-probability event Et . First we have

where the first inequality holds on E by definition of U and the second by the fact that t+ ≥ t (and log(1/δ̃(t)) ≤
log(1/δ̃(t+ ))). The same result also holds for (hpt , ipt ) at time t:
s

(16)

Note that we never pull the root node (0, 1), therefore ht > 0.

≥ f (xh∗ ,i∗ ) + ν1 ρh ≥ f ∗ ,

where (1) follows from the fact that t+ ≥ t, on (2) we rely on the fact that the event Et holds at time t and on (3)
we use the regularity of the function w.r.t. the maximum f ∗ from Eq. 14. If an optimal node (h∗ , i∗ ) is a leaf, then
Bh∗ ,i∗ (t) = Uh∗ ,i∗ (t) ≥ f ∗ . In the case that (h∗ , i∗ ) is not a leaf, there always exists a leaf (h+ , i+ ) such that
x∗ ∈ Ph+ ,i+ for which (h∗ , i∗ ) is its ancestor, since all the optimal nodes with h > h∗ are descendants of (h∗ , i∗ ).
Now by propagating the bound backward from (h+ , i+ ) to (h∗ , i∗ ) through Eq. 5 (see Eq. 12) we can show that
Bh∗ ,i∗ (t) is still a valid upper bound of the optimal value f ∗ . Thus for any optimal node (h∗ , i∗ ) at time t under the
event Et we have
Bh∗ ,i∗ (t) ≥ f ∗ .
Combining this with Eq. 15, Eq. 16 and Eq. 13 , we obtain that on event Et the selected node (ht , it ) and its parent
(hpt , ipt ) at any time t is such that

∆ht ,it ≤ 3c

where we also used that t+ ≤ 2t for any t. Although this provides a preliminary bound on the instantaneous regret

In the case of parent (hpt , ipt ), since Thpt ,ipt (t) ≥ τhpt (t), we deduce

also recall the result of Eq. 19 which guarantees that (ht , it ), the parent of the selected node (ht , it ), is 3ν1 ρht −1

the number of 3ν1 ρh -optimal nodes is bounded by the covering number N (3ν1 /ν2 ε, l, ε) with ε = ν1 ρh . Thus we

the maximum of some random variables is always larger than their average. We introduce a new variable h′ = h + 1
to derive (3). For proving (4) we rely on the argument that, for any h > 0, Ih+ (n) covers all the internal nodes at
layer h. This implies that the set of the children of Ih+ (n) covers Ih+1 (n). This combined with fact that the inner

B Correlated Bandit feedback
We begin the analysis of HCT-Γ by proving some useful concentration inequalities for non-iid random variables
under the mixing assumptions of Sect. 2.

B.1

Concentration Inequality for non-iid Episodic Random Variables

In this section we extend the result in (Azar et al., 2013) and we derive a concentration inequality for averages of
non-iid random variables grouped in episodes. In fact, given the structure of the HCT-Γ algorithm, the rewards
observed from an arm x are not necessarily consecutive but they are obtained over multiple episodes. This result is
of independent interest, thus we first report it in its general form and we later apply it to HCT-Γ.
In HCT-Γ, once an arm is selected, it is pulled for a number of consecutive steps and many steps may pass before it
is selected again. As a result, the rewards observed from one arm are obtained through a series of episodes. Given a
fixed horizon n, let Kn (x) be the total number of episodes when arm x has been selected, we denote by tk (x), with
k = 1, . . . , Kn (x), the step when k-th episode of arm x has started and by vk (x) the length of episode k. Finally,
22

PK (x)
Tn (x) = k n vk (x) is the total number of samples from arm x. The objective is to study the concentration of

towards the mean-reward f (x) of the arm. In order to simplify the notation, in the following we drop the dependency
from n and x and we use K, tk , and vk . We first introduce two quantities. For any t = 1, . . . , n and for any
k = 1, . . . , K, we define
Mtk (x)

as the expectation of the sum of rewards within episode k, conditioned on the filtration Ft up to time t (see definition
in Section 2),9 and the residual
k
(x).
εkt (x) = Mtk (x) − Mt−1

We prove the following.
Lemma 5. For any x ∈ X , k = 1, . . . , K, and t = 1, . . . , n, εkt (x) is a bounded martingale sequence difference,
i.e., εkt (x) ≤ 2Γ + 1 and E[εkt (x)|Ft−1 ] = 0.
Proof. Given the definition of Mtk (x) we have that

Notice that the index t of the filtration can be before, within, or after the k-th episode.

B.2

Proof of Thm. 2

The notation needed in this section is the same as in Section A. We only need to restate the notation about the
episodes from previous section to HCT-Γ. We denote by Kh,i (n) the number of episodes for node (h, i) up to time
n, by th,i (k) the step when episode k is started, and by vh,i (k) the number of steps of episode k.
We first notice that Lemma 1 holds

We drop the dependency of M on x.

where Kh,i (t) is the number of episodes in which we pull arm xh,i . At each episode in which xh,i is selected,
its number of pulls Th,i is doubled w.r.t. the previous episode, except for those episodes where the current time
s becomes larger than s+ , which triggers the termination of the episode. However since s+ doubles whenever s
becomes larger than s+ , the total number of times when episodes are interrupted because of s ≥ s+ can be at
maximum log2 (t) withing a time horizon of t. This means that the total number of times an episode finishes without
doubling Th,i (t) is bounded by log2 (t). Thus we have
Kh,i (t)−log2 (t)−1

Th,i (t) ≥

The result of Lem. 7 facilitates the adaption of the previous results of iid case to the case of correlated rewards, since
this bound is similar to those of standard tail’s inequality such as Hoeffding and Azuma’s inequality. Based on this
result we can extend the results of previous section to the case of dependent arms.
We now introduce the high probability event Et,n under which the mean reward for all the selected nodes in the
interval [t, n] is within a confidence interval of the empirical estimates at every time step in the interval. The event
Et,n is needed to concentrate the sum of obtained rewards around the sum of their corresponding arm means. Note
that unlike the previous theorem where we could make use of a simple martingale argument to concentrate the
rewards around their means, here the rewards are not unbiased samples of the arm means. Therefore, we need a
more advanced technique than the Azuma’s inequality for concentration of measure.
Lemma 8 (High-probability event). We define the set of all the possible nodes in trees of maximum depth Hmax (t)
as
[
Lt =
Nodes(T ).
T :Depth(T )≤Hmax (t)

We introduce the event

then for any fixed t, the event Ωt holds with probability 1 − δ/t7 and the joint event Et,n holds with probability at

Proof. The structure of the proof is exactly the same as in Thm. 1. Thus, here we report only the main differences
in each step.
Step 1: Decomposition of the regret. We first decompose the regret in two terms. We rewrite the instantaneous
regret ∆t as
b t,
∆t = f ∗ − rt = f ∗ − f (xht ,it ) + f (xht ,it ) − rt = ∆ht ,it + ∆

where (1) follows from the definition of Et,n = ns=t Ωs , thus if Et,n holds at time t then Ωs also holds at s =
t̄h,i ≥ t. Step (2) follows
bh,i : First we notice that for the node (hn , in ) we have that
P from the definition of µ
µhn ,in (n) = nt=1 rt I(ht ,it )=(hn ,in ) since we update the statistics at the end. for every other node we have
Thn ,in (n)b
that the last selection time t̄h,i and the end of last episode coincides together . Now since
Pwe update the statistics of
the selected node at the end of every episode, thus, we have that Th,i (t̄h,i )b
µh,i (t̄h,i ) = nt=1 rt I(ht ,it )=(h,i) also for
(h, i) 6= (hn , in ). Step (3) follows from the definition of Ωs . The resulting bound matches the one in Eq. 20 up to
constants and it can be bound similarly.

where the first sequence of equalities in (1) simply follows from the definition of episodes. In (2) we bound the
instantaneous regret by Eq. 32. Step (3) follows from the fact that when (h, i) is selected, its statistics, including
Th,i , are not changed until the end of the episode. Step (4) is an immediate application of Lemma 19 in Jaksch et al.
(2010).

It is not difficult to prove that for a suitable choice H, we obtain the final bound of O(log(n)1/(d+2) n(d+1)/(d+2) ) on
Rn . This combined with the result of Lem. 8 and a union bound on all n ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . } proves the final result.

Proof of Thm. 3

Theorem 3 Let δ ∈ (0, 1), δ̃(n) = 9 ρ/(4ν1 )δ/n, and c = 3(3Γ+1) 1/(1 − ρ). We assume that Assumptions 1–5
hold and that rewards are generated according to the general model defined in Section 2. Then if δ = 1/n the space
complexity of HCT-Γ is
E(Nn ) = O(log(n)2/(d+2) nd/(d+2) ).
Proof. We assume that the space requirement for each node (i.e., storing variables such as µ
bh,i , Th.i ) is a unit. Let
Bt denote the event corresponding to the branching/expansion of the node (ht , it ) selected at time t, then the space
29

complexity is Nn =

where (1) follows from the fact that nodes in Ih+ (n) have been expanded at time th,i when their number of pulls
Th,i (th,i ) ≤ Th,i (n) exceeded the threshold τh,i (th,i ). Step (2) follows from Eq. 8, while (3) from the definition of
c > 1. Finally, step (4) follows from the fact that the number of nodes at depth h cannot be larger than twice the
parent nodes at depth h − 1. By inverting the previous inequality, we obtain
(d) ≤ 2ν12 nρ2H .
On other hand, in order to bound (c), we need to use the same the high-probability events Et,n and similar passages
+
(n)| ≤ 2C(ν2 ρ(h−1) )−d . Plugging these results back in Eq. 36 leads
as in Eq. 22, which leads to |Ih (n)| ≤ 2|Ih−1
to
NnE ≤ 1 + 2HC(ν2 ρ(H−1) )−d + 2ν12 nρ2H ,
with high probability. Together with NnE we obtain

E Nn ≤ 1 + 2HC(ν2 ρ(H−1) )−d + 2ν12 nρ2H + C ≤ 1 + 2Hmax (n)C(ν2 ρ(H−1) )−d + 2ν12 nρ2H + C,

where Hmax (n) is the upper bound on the depth of the tree in Lemma 1. Optimizing H in the remaining terms leads
to the statement.
