However, if Z is unobserved, and W is but a noisy

that adjusting for W is inadequate, for it leaves the
back-door path(s) X ← Z → Y unblocked.1 Therefore, regardless of sample size, the effect of X on Y

The possibility of removing bias by modified adjustment is far from obvious, because, although P (w|z)
is assumed given, the actual value of the confounder
Z remains uncertain for each measurement W = w,
so one would expect to get either a distribution over
causal effects, or bounds thereof. Instead, we can actually get a repaired point estimate of P (y|do(x)) that
is asymptotically unbiased.
This result, which I will label “effect restoration,”
has powerful consequences in practice because, when
P (w|z) is not given, one can resort to a Bayesian
(or bounding) analysis and assume a prior distribution (or bounds) on the parameters of P (w|z) which
would yield a distribution (or bounds) over P (y|do(x))
(Greenland, 2007). Alternatively, if costs permit, one
can estimate P (w|z) by re-testing Z in a sampled subpopulation (Carroll et al., 2006).2

In the literature on measurement errors and sensitiv-

On the surface, the possibility of correcting for measurement bias seems to undermine the importance of
accurate measurements. It suggests that as long as we
know how bad our measurements are there is no need
to correct them because they can be corrected post-hoc
by analytical means. This is not so. First, although an
unbiased effect estimate can be recovered from noisy
measurements, sampling variability increases substantially with error. Second, even assuming unbounded
sample size, the estimate will be biased if the postulated P (w|z) is incorrect.3
Effect restoration can be analyzed from either a statistical or causal viewpoint. Taking the statistical view,
one may argue that, once the effect P (y|do(x)) is identified in terms of a latent variable Z and given by the
estimand in (1), the problem is no longer one of causal
inference, but rather of regression analysis, whereby
the regressional expression Ez P (y|x, z) need to be estimated from a noisy measurement of Z, as given by
W . This is indeed the approach taken in the vast literature on measurement error (e.g., (Selén, 1986; Carroll
et al., 2006)).
The causal analytic perspective is different; it maintains that the ultimate purpose of the analysis is not
the statistics of X, Y , and Z, as is normally assumed
in the measurement literature, but a causal quantity
P (y|do(x)) that is mapped into regression vocabulary only when certain causal assumptions are deemed
plausible. Moreover, the very idea of modeling the error mechanism P (w|z) requires causal considerations;
errors caused by noisy measurements are fundamentally different from those caused by noisy agitators.
Indeed, the reason we seek an estimate P (w|z) as opposed to P (z|w), be it from judgment or from pilot
studies, is that we consider the former parameter to
be a more reliable and transportable than the latter. Transportability is a causal consideration that
is hardly touched upon in the statistical measurement
literature, where causal vocabulary is usually avoided
and causal relations relegated to informal judgment
(e.g., (Carroll et al., 2006, pp. 29–32)).
Viewed from this perspective, the measurement error
literature appears to be engaged (unwittingly) in a
causal inference exercise that can benefit substantially
from making the causal framework explicit. The benity analysis, this sort of exercise is normally done by recalibration techniques (Greenland and Lash, 2008). The
latter employs a “validation study” in which Z is measured
without error in a subpopulation and used to calibrate the
estimates in the main study (Selén, 1986).
3
In extreme cases, wrongly postulated P (w|z) may conflict with the data, and no estimate will be obtained. For
example, if we postulate a non informative W , P (w|z) =
P (w), and we find that W strongly depends on X, a contradiction arises and no effect estimate will emerge.

efit can in fact be mutual; identifiability with partially
specified causal parameters (as in Fig. 1) is rarely discussed in the causal inference literature (notable exceptions are Hernán and Cole (2009), Goetghebeur
and Vansteelandt (2005), and Cai and Kuroki (2008)),
while graphical models are hardly used in the measurement error literature.
In this paper we will consider the mathematical aspects of effect restoration and will focus on asymptotic
analysis. Our aims are to understand the conditions
under which effect restoration is feasible, to assess the
computational problems it presents, and to identify
those features of P (w|z) and P (x, y, w) that are major contributors to measurement bias, and those that
contribute to robustness against bias.

EFFECT RESTORATION BY
MATRIX ADJUSTMENT

The main idea, adapted from Greenland and Lash
(2008, p. 360), is as follows: Starting with the joint
probability P (x, y, z, w), and assuming that W depends only on Z,4 i.e.,
P (w|x, y, z) = P (w|z)

(2)

we write
P (x, y, w) =

X

P (x, y, z, w)

X

P (w|x, y, z)P (x, y, z)

X

P (w|z)P (x, y, z)

z

=

z

=

z

For each x and y, we can interpret the transformation
above as a vector-matrix multiplication:
V (w) =

X

M (w, z)V (z)

z

where V (w) = P (x, y, w) and M (w, z) = P (w|z) is a
stochastic matrix (i.e., the entries in each column are
non-negative and sum to one). It is well known that,
under fairly broad conditions, M has an inverse (call
it I), which allows us to write:
P (x, y, z) =

X

I(z, w)P (x, y, w)

(3)

w

We are done now, because (3) enables us to reconstruct
the joint distribution of X, Y , and Z from that of the

“non-

observed variables, X, Y , and W . Thus, each term
on the right hand side of (1) can be obtained from
P (x, y, w) through (3) and, assuming Z is a sufficient
set (i.e., satisfying the back-door test), P (y|do(x)) is
estimable from the available data. Explicitly, we have:
X
P (y|do(x)) =
P (y, z, x)P (z)/P (x, z)

(4)

Note that the same inverse matrix, I, appears in all
summations. This will not be the case when we do
not assume independent noise mechanisms. In other
words, if (2) does not hold, we must write:
X
P (x, y, w) =
P (w|x, y, z)P (x, y, z)
z

=

X

Mxy (w, z)P (x, y, z)

z

where Mxy and its inverse Ixy are both indexed by the
specific values of x and y, and we then obtain:
X
Ixy (z, w)P (x, y, w)
(5)
P (x, y, z) =
w

which, again, permits the identification of the causal
effect via (4) except that the expression becomes somewhat more complicated. It is also clear that errors in
the measurement of X and Y can be absorbed into a
vector W , and do not present any conceptual problem.
Equation (4) demonstrates the feasibility of effect reconstruction and proves that, despite the uncertainty
in the variables X, Y and Z, the causal effect is identifiable once we know the statistics of the error mechanism.5
This result is reassuring, but presents practical challenges of both representation, computation and estimation. Given the potentially high dimensionality of Z and W , the parameterization of I would
in general be impractical or prohibitive. However,
if we can assume independent local mechanisms,
P (w|z) can be decomposed into a product P (w|z) =
5
Kuroki and Pearl (2010) have further shown that, under certain conditions, the matrix P (w|z) can be inferred
from the data alone.

P (w1 |z1 )P (w2 |z2 ), . . . , P (wk |zk ) which renders I decomposable as well. Even when full decomposition is
not plausible, sparse couplings between the different
noise mechanisms would enable parsimonious parameterization using, for example, Bayesian networks.
The second challenge concerns the summations in Eq.
(4) which, taken literally, calls for exponentially long
summation over all values of w. In practice, however,
this can be mitigated since, for any given z, there will
be only small number of w’s for which I(z, w) is nonnegligible. This computation, again, can be performed
efficiently using Bayes networks inference.
This still would not permit us to deal with the problem of empty cells which, owed to the high dimensionality of Z and W would prevent us from getting
reliable statistics of P (x, y, w), as required by (4). One
should resort therefore to propensity score (P S) methods, which map the cells of Z onto a single scalar.
The error-free propensity score L(z) = P (X = 1|Z =
z) being a functional of P (x, y, z) can of course be estimated consistently from samples of P (x, y, w) using
the transformation (3). Explicitly, we have:
L(z) = P (X = 1|Z = z)
= P (X = 1, Z = z)/P (z)
X

P (X = 1, y, z)/

where P (x, y, z) is given in (3).
Using the decomposition in (2), we can further write:

where L(w) is the error-prone propensity score
L(w) = P (X = 1|W = w).
We see that L(z) can be computed from I(z, w), L(w)
and P (w). Thus, if we succeed in estimating these
three quantities in a parsimonious parametric form,
the computation of L(z) would be hindered only by the
summations called for in (5). Once we estimate L(w)
parametrically for each conceivable w, Eq. (6) permits
us to assign to each tuple z a bias-less score L(z) that
correctly represents the probability of X = 1 given
Z = z. This, in turn, should permit us to estimate,
for each stratum L = l, the probability
X
P (l) =
P (z)
z|L(z)=l

then compute the causal effect using
X
P (y|do(x)) =
P (y|x, l)P (l).

One technique for approximating P (l) was proposed
by Stürmer et al. (2005), and Schneeweiss et al. (2009)
which does not make full use of the inversion in (9)
or of graphical methods facilitating this inversion.
A more promising approach would be to construct
P (l) and P (y|x, l) directly from synthetic samples of
P (x, y, z) that can be created to mirror the empirical
samples of P (x, y, w). This is illustrated in the next
subsection, using binary variables.

P (w1 |x, y) approaches δ, most of that weight the twin

Metaphorically, the transformation in (7) can be described as a mass re-assignment process, as if every
two cells, (x, y, w0 ) and (x, y, w1 ), compete on how
to split their combined weight P (x, y) between the
two latent cells (x, y, z0 ) and (x, y, z1 ) thus creating a
synthetic population P (x, y, z) from which (4) follows.
Figure 2 describes how P (w1 |x, y), the fraction of the

Clearly, when  + δ = 1, W provides no information
about Z and the inverse does not exist. Likewise,
whenever any of the synthetic probabilities P (x, y, z)
falls outside the (0, 1) interval, a modeling constraint
is violated (see (Pearl, 1988, Chapter 8)) meaning that
the observed distribution P (x, y, w) and the postulated error mechanism P (w|z) are incompatible with
the structure of Fig. 1 (see footnote 3). If we assign
reasonable priors to  and δ, the linear function in Fig.
2 will become an S-shaped curve over the entire [0, 1]
interval, and each sample (x, y, w) can then be used to
update the relative weight P (x, y, z1 )/P (x, y, z0 ).
To compute the causal effect P (y|do(x)) we need only
substitute P (x, y, z) from (7) into Eqs. (1) or (4),

This expression highlights the difference between the

Eq. (3.11))):

The extra factors in Eq. (8) can be viewed as modifiers

assess, given  and δ, what bias would be introduced if
we ignore errors altogether and treat W as a faithful
representation of Z.

We see that, even with two error parameters ( and δ),
and eight cells, the expression for P (y|do(x)) does not
simplify to provide an intuitive understanding of the
effect of  and δ on the estimand. Such evaluation will
be facilitated in linear models (Section 4).

Equation (9) follows from Wright’s rules of path analysis and reflects the well known fact (e.g., (Bollen, 1989,
p. 224)) that, in linear models, structural parameters
are identifiable (up to a constant var(Z)) whenever
each latent variable (in our case Z) has three independent proxies (in our case X, W , and V )6

Assuming now that Z is a sufficient set of K binary
variables and, similarly, W is a set of K local indicators
of Z, satisfying (2). Each sample (x, y, w) should give
rise to a synthetic distribution over the 2K cells of
(x, y, z) given by a product of K local distributions
in the form of (7). This synthetic distribution can be
sampled to generate synthetic (x, y, z) samples, from
which the true propensity score L(z) = P (X = 1|z) as
well as the causal effect P (y|do(x)) can be estimated,
as discussed in Section 2.

4

Cai and Kuroki (2008) and Kuroki and Pearl (2010)
further showed that c0 is identifiable from measurements of three proxies (of Z), even when these proxies
are dependent of each other. For example, connecting
W to X and V to Y , still permits the identification of
c0 .
To find c0 in the model of Fig. 3, we write the three
structural equations in the model
Y = c2 Z + c0 X +  Y
W = c3 Z +  W
X = c1 Z +  X

EFFECT RESTORATION IN
LINEAR MODELS

Figure 3 depicts a linear version of the structural equation model (SEM) shown in Fig. 1. Here, the task is
to estimate the effect coefficient c0 , while the parameters c3 and var(w ), representing the noise mechanism
W = c3 Z + W , are assumed given.
Linear models offer two advantageous in handling measurement errors. First, they provide a more transparent picture into the role of each factor in the model.
Second, certain aspects of the error mechanism can often be identified without resorting to external studies.
This occurs, for example, when Z possesses two independent indicators, say W and V (as in Fig. 3(b)), in
which case the product c23 var(Z) is identifiable and is
given by:
c23 var(Z) =

cov(XW )cov(XV )
.
cov(W V )

(9)

As we shall see below, this product is sufficient for
identifying c0 .

and express the structural parameters in terms of the
variances and covariances of the observed variables.
This gives (after some algebra):
c0 =

cov(XY ) − cov(XW )cov(W Y )/c23 var(Z)
(10)
var(X) − cov2 (XW )/c23 var(Z)

and shows that the pivotal quantity needed for the
identification of c0 is the product
c23 var(Z) = var(W ) − var(W )

(11)

If we are in possession of several proxies for Z,
c23 var(Z) can be estimated from the data, as in Eq.
(9), yielding:
c0 =

cov(XY )cov(XV ) − cov(Y W )cov(W V ))
(12)
cov(XV )var(X) − cov(XW )cov(W V )

6
This partial identifiability of the so called “factor loadings,” is not an impediment for the identification of c0 .
However, if we were in possession of only one proxy (as in
Fig. 3(a)) then knowledge of c3 alone would be insufficient,
the product c23 var(Z) is required.

If however Z has only one proxy, W , as in Fig. 3(a),
the product c23 var(Z) must be estimated externally,
using either a pilot study or judgmental assessment.
The decomposition on the right hand side of Eq.
(11) simplifies the judgmental assessment of c23 var(Z),
since c3 and W are the parameters of an additive error
mechanism
W = c3 Z +  W ;
c3 = E(W |z)/z measures the slope with which the
average of W tracks the value of Z, while var(W )
measures the dispersion of W around that average.
var(W ) can, of course be estimated from the data.
Under a Gaussian distribution assumption, c3 and
var(W ) fully characterize the conditional density
f(w|z) which, according to Section 2, is sufficient for
restoring the joint distribution of x, y, and z, and thus
secure the identification of the causal effect, through
(1). This explains why the estimation of c3 alone, be
it from experimental data or our understanding of the
physics behind the error process, is not sufficient for
neutralizing the confounder Z. It also explains why the
technique of “latent factor” analysis (Bollen, 1989) is
sufficient for identifying causal effects, even though it
fails to identify the “factor loading” c3 separately of
var(Z).
In the noiseless case, i.e., var(W ) = 0, we have
var(Z) = var(W )/c23 and Eq. (10) reduces to:
cov(XY ) − cov(XW )cov(W Y )/var(W )
var(X) − cov2 (XW )/var(W )
βyx − βyw βwx
=
1 − βxw βwx
= βyx·w
(13)

c0 =

where
βyx = cov(XY )/var(X)
∂
=
E(Y |x)
∂x
and βyx·w is the coefficient of x in the regression of Y
on X and W , or:
βyx·w

∂
=
E(Y |x, w)
∂x

As expected, the equality c0 = βyx·z = βyx·w assures
a bias-free estimate of c0 through adjustment for W ,
instead of Z; c3 plays no role in this adjustment.
In the error-prone case, c0 can be written
βyx − βyw βwx /k
c0 =
1 − βxw βwx /k

where
k = 1 − var(W )/var(W )
and, as the formula reveals, c0 cannot be interpreted in
terms of an adjustment for a surrogate variable V (W ).
The strategy of adjusting for a surrogate variables has
served as an organizing principle for many studies in
traditional measurement error analysis (Carroll et al.,
2006). For example, if one seeks to estimate the coefficient c1 = E(X|z)/z through a proxy W of Z, one
can always choose to regress X on another variable, V ,
such that the slope of X on V , E(X|v)/v, would yield
an unbiased estimate of c1 . In our example of Fig. 3,
one should choose V to be the best linear estimate of
Z, given W , namely V = αW , where
α = Cov(ZW )/var(W ) = c3 var(Z)/var(W )
is to be estimated separately, from a pilot study. However, this Two Stage Least Square strategy is not applicable in adjusting for latent confounders; i.e., there
is no variable V (W ) such that c0 = βyx·v .

MODEL TESTING WITH
MEASUREMENT ERROR

When variables are measured without error, a structural equation model can be tested and diagnosed systematically by examining how well the data agrees
with each statistical constraint that the model imposes
on the joint distribution (or covariance matrix). The
most common type of these constraints are conditional
independence relations (or zero partial correlations),
and these can be read off the causal diagram through
the d-separation criterion (Pearl, 2009, pp. 335–7). For
each missing edge in the diagram, say between X and
Y , the model dictates the conditional independence of
X and Y given a set Z of variables that d-separates
X from Y in the diagram; these independencies can
then be tested individually and systematically to assure compatibility between model and data before parameter identification commences (Kyono, 2010).
When Z suffers from measurement errors (as in Fig.
1) those conditional independencies are not testable,
since the proxies of Z no longer d-separate X from
Y . The question arises whether surrogate tests exist
through the available proxies, to detect possible violations of the missing-edge postulate. The preceding
section suggests such tests, provided we know (or can
estimate) the parameters of the error process.
This is seen by substituting c0 = 0 in Eq. (10), and accepting the vanishing of the numerator as a surrogate
test for d-separation between X and Y :

Theorem 1. If a latent variable Z d-separates two
measured variables, X and Y , and Z has a proxy W ,
W = cZ + W , then cov(XY ) must satisfy:
cov(XY ) = cov(XW )cov(W Y )/c2 var(Z)
= cov(XW )cov(W Y )/[var(W ) − var(W )]
(14)

We see that the usual condition of vanishing partial regression coefficient is replaced by a modified condition,
in which c2 var(Z) needs to be estimated separately
(as in Fig. 3(b)). If the product c2 var(Z) is estimated
from other proxies of Z, as in Fig. 3(b), Eq. (14) assumes the form of a TETRAD condition (Bollen, 1989,
p. 304).
cov(XY ) = cov(V W )cov(W Y )/cov(XV )
Cai and Kuroki (2008) derive additional conditions under which this constraint applies to multivariate sets
of confounders and proxies.
Equation (14) can also be written
cov[Y (X − W cov(XW )/α)] = 0

(15)

where α = var(W ) − var(W ), which provides an easy
test of (14), in the style of Two Stage Least Square:
1. estimate α = var(W ) − var(W ) (using a pilot
study or auxiliary proxy variables)
2. collect samples Xi , Yi , Wi i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., n
3. estimate c1 = cov(XW )
4. Translate the data into fictitious samples
Yi , Vi i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n with Vi = Xi − c1 /αWi
5. Compute (by Least Square) the best fit coefficient
a in Yi = aVi + ei
6. Test if a = 0. If a vanishes with sufficiently high
confidence, then the data is compatible with the
d-separation condition X⊥
⊥Y |Z.
Theorem 1 can be generalized to include missing edges
between latent variables, as well as between latent
and observed variables. In fact, if the graph resulting from filling in a missing edge permits the identification of the corresponding edge coefficient c, then
the original graph imposes a statistical constraint on
the covariance matrix that can be used to test the absence of that edge. Such tests should serve as modeldiagnostic tools, before (or instead) of submitting the
entire model to a global test of fitness.

CONCLUSIONS

The paper discusses computational and representational problems connected with effect restoration when
confounders are mismeasured or misclassified. In particular, we have explicated how measurement bias can
be removed by creating synthetic samples from empirical samples, and how inverse-probability weighting can
be modified to account for measurement error. Subsequently, we have analyzed measurement bias in linear systems and explicated graphical conditions under
which such bias can be removed.
