developed extensively in BNs. There are several exact and
approximate inference algorithms for use with BNs, and
although general inference has been shown to be NP-hard
[Cooper 1990, Dagum et al. 1993B], special-case
algorithms and corresponding conditions have been

established that allow tractable inference [Neapolitan
1990]. Finally, great attention has been given, and
substantial results obtained, in the field of automated
learning of BNs from data [Cooper et al. 1992, Spirtes et
a!. 1992, Heckerman et a!. 1994, Bouckaert 1994].
BNs were not designed to model temporal
relationships explicitly. In many problem areas, however,
the ability to model effectively the temporal aspects of the
domain plays a crucial role in the success of the modeling
effort. For example, in medicine, representing and
r�asoning about time is crucial for broad reasoning tasks
hke prevention, diagnosis, therapeutic management,
prognosis, and discovery. Similarly, in areas such as
economics, biology, and scheduling (among others),
capturing the dynamic aspects of the problem at hand is
essential for successful problem solving.
Time modeling is an area that has also been intensively
explored in a number of scientific fields that are
characterized by vastly different perspectives, such as
philosophy, physics, statistics, operations research, and
more recently artificial intelligence [van Fraassen 1970,
Allen 1984, Tansel et a!. 1993, Haddaway 1994]. This
research shows that devising computer systems that can
utilize the temporal dynamics of a problem area to provide
decision support (a major goal of AI) is difficult on at
least three levels:
(a) Temporal expressiveness: It is difficult to develop
computational formalisms (i.e., representations) that allow
us to express the time-evolving and sensitive domain
knowledge in a natural way for a wide variety of domains
or tasks within a domain.
(b) Temporal knowledge acquisition: It is hard to find
experts and/or data that would allow the instantiation of
temporal models with the appropriate knowledge.
Sometimes the available knowledge is more abstracted
than the model language asks for. Often the expert is not
comfortable specifying the full temporal evolution of a
particular domain process, although he can partially
specify this process in terms of summary (i.e., temporally
abstracted) and qualitative temporal relationships.
(c) Computational tractability: Temporal models typically
are much more detailed than atemporal ones. Even when
they involve a few variables, examining these and their
interactions over multiple points of time often entails an

A Structurally and Temporally Extended BN Model

inordinate amount of computation, due to the size and the
complexity of the resulting model.
These problem areas readily suggest that any successful
time-modeling formalism should be designed so that it
satisfies temporal expressiveness, computational
efficiency and temporal knowledge acquisition
requirements. We call these properties temporal
desiderata, since they are so crucial for time modeling.
Additional desiderata are ones that are considered useful
across all knowledge representations, not j ust temporal
ones (we call those universal desiderata). In particular,
the ideal representation should handle uncertainty in a
principled and unambiguous way. It should support
normative decision-making. It should handle causality,
causal manipulation, and have a declarative semantics. An
ideal representation would also be sound and complete, as
well as amenable to machine-learning and explanation
methods.
Standard BNs do satisfy the universal desiderata. They
handle uncertainty using the well-defined and extensively
studied language of probability theory. BNs support
decision-theoretic rationality, a framework for making
normative decisions very well suited to many problems,
such as economic and medical ones. BNs can be
interpreted causally both for discovery and optimal
decision-making purposes [Spirtes 1992, Drudzel et aL
1993]. BNs do have declarative semantics and support
sound and complete reasoning (in the sense that the
correct probability of any proposition of variables can be
derived conditioned on any other proposition of variables).
Finally, several machine learning and explanation
methodologies have been under investigation, with
promising results during the last decade [Cooper et al.
1992, Spirtes et al. 1992, Beckerman et aL 1994,
Bouckaert 1994, Suermondt et a!. 1993].
These positive properties of BNs, suggest building a
language of time modeling on them by adding new
features that facilitate temporal representation and
reasoning. This explains why an important trend in the
study and use of BNs is their extension, usage and/or
analyses to accommodate decision, causal, temporal and
planning models of problem solving [Provan 1993,
Drudzel et aL 1993, Ngo et al. 1995]. Some of these
extensions are practical approaches that emphasize
achieving problem solutions with minimal alterations in
the base model [Provan 1993, Polasheck et aL 1993].
Other researchers have extended the language of BNs
[Dagum et al. 1993A, Hanks et aL 1995, Darwiche et a!.
1994].
In [Aliferis et al. 1995], we introduced Modifiable
Temporal Belief Networks (MTBNs), a temporal and
structural extension to BNs that model time-sensitive
domains in medicine. Although our point of departure is
medical, the generality of our approach (as it will be
discussed in this paper) should make MTBNs applicable

29

to non-medical domains as well. In this paper, we discuss
MTBNs by providing definitions of the model and
examining its theoretical properties. We also examine
temporal modeling techniques, compare different classes
of MTBNs, and discuss conclusions and future research.

2. AN EXAMPLE OF AN MTBN MODEL
In this section we give an example of using MTBNs to
represent and apply temporal knowledge to solve a small
temporal reasoning task. The purpose of the example is to
give an intuitive notion of MTBNs, before giving more
formal definitions.
Figure 1 presents a small MTBN that captures a
fundamental causal mechanism: the feedback between
glucose (G) and insulin levels (I) in the human body. An
increased glucose blood level triggers the secretion of
insulin, which in turn causes the glucose level to drop.
Low levels of glucose cause the secretion of insulin to
drop, which in turn might allow the glucose level to rise.
We know that the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM)
can interfere with this regulatory mechanism. In this
simplistic model, and solely for the purposes of
demonstration, assume that DM interferes by modulating
the value of the lag (delay) between changes in the insulin
and change in the glucose leveL In particular, DM is
associated with higher chances of a prolonged delay. We
emphasize that this example is intended only to show
some basic MTBN modeling principles and is not
intended to be medical! accurate.

Figure 1: A simple MTBN model of glucose-insulin
interaction (DM=diabetes mellitus, G=glucose, /==insulin).
This MTBN model makes it possible to answer questions
such as:
-Given that at time point 1, 2, and 3 we know that
diabetes me llitus=tr ue and that at time 1 glucose=high,
what is the probability that glucose at time 3 will be high?
-Given that we have measurements of glucose and
insulin at points 1,2,3, what is the probability that diabetes
me llitus=false?
In table 1 we give a specification for this MTBN, as
well as examples of terminology. In the specification
below," X," means "variable X at timet". Qualitatively,

we would say for this example that higher glucose causes
higher insulin, higher insulin causes lower glucose, and
that diabetes causes a more delayed response of glucose
levels to insulin levels.

This example informally introduces some important
concepts ofMTBN models. FirstMTBNs involve

probabilistic causal relations among propositional

variables. The variables are examined for a period of time.
Variables are measured at discrete time points. The delay
between cause and effect is itself a variable which is
modeled explicitly. The causal relations between variables
are themselves variables, which are modeled explicitly.
The model is fully specified by defining how each
variable is determined by its parents (given different
conditioning of the relevant arc and l ag variables). We
note that in this example an additional feature ofMTBN s
is not depicted, specifically the ability to model 'abstract'
or non-indexed variables. These will be explained in the
subsequent sections.
3. DEFINITIONS OF THE MTBN MODEL

We now formalize the components of anMTBN.
Definition 3.1. A n MTBN-SG (single-granularity MTBN)

is defined asMTBN-SG = {Gt, Tr, G, D, J}, where each
of the elements is defined as follows.
Gt {temporal graph): This is a directed graph
(possibly cyclic) composed of nodes and arcs
corresponding to 3 types of variables. The first type of
variable is an ordinary variable, semantically
corresponding to (potentially) observable phenomena.
An ordinary variable is either explicitly associated with a
time point (i.e., is temporally indexed) or not (i.e., is
abstract). The interpretation of an abstract variable is that
it is assigned a value at some time within the temporal
range of the model. This time is not specified and can only
be constrained by causal associations of the abstract
variable with other variables in the model.
The set of all ordinary variables is denoted by V. All
ordinary variables are represented in the graph by a node
that has a symbolic name. The second type of variable is a
mechanism variable (also called an "arc vari able"),
semantically corresponding to causal mechanisms
between variables. The set of all mechanism variables is
denoted by E. In anMTBN graph, all variables in E are
represented as an arc between two other variables.
Mechanism variables take one of two possible values (true
or false, that is, active or inactive). As a convention, arc
variables that do not have the constant value 'true' are
denoted graphically by an arc with a circle. The third type
of variable is time-lag quantifier variable, semantically
corresponding to the time lag (expressed in time units and
being positive) between a variable V, (the cause) and a
variable V2 (the effect). The set of time-lag quantifying
variables is denoted by L. Every variable in L is
represented in Gt as a square node associated with an arc
(mechanism variable). This node has a symbolic name, or
in the case it has a constant value, the name can be
replaced by a numeric constant. We will use the symbol X
to denote a variable of any type. We will also adopt all the

A Structurally and Temporally Extended BN Model

standard graph-theoretic notions of parent, child, sibling,
descendant (direct, indirect), ancestor (direct, indirect),
path (directed or not), cycle (directed or not) [Neapolitan

1990].

inactive), 53={ [A->B]1=inactive, [A->Blz=active}, S4=
{ [A->B1] =inactive, [A->B]2= inactive}. The first
substructure of 52 is 52_1 = { [A->B)1=active}, while the
second substructure of 52 is 52_2 = { [A->B]1=inactive }.

Tr: the temporal range (or frame of discernment). Tr =
[ t , .. ,tJ , where t1 is the initial time point of interest and t,
is the last time point of interest. We associate variables
with a discrete, ordered, linear, unbounded model of time,
in which temporal intervals are built from temporal points
and only a portion of the temporal line is modeled
explicitly during problem solving. Instantaneous

0----0

influences are also allowed and are modeled inMTBNs,
as having time lags of constant value 0.
G: the temporal unit granularity This is the unit of
time in our model.

0: a deployment transformation.

A temporal graph

contains information on causal processes and the way they
behave and they evolve over time. This information is
represented in a compact form in Gt, and thus it has to be
unfolded over time to actually model the domain of
interest (and perform inference). We call the compact
representation the condensed graph, and the unfolded one
the deployed graph. We call the transformation from
condensed to deployed form for single-granularity

(SO),
and it operates as follows: n co pies of every variable are
created. Each variable copy is time-stamped with an

4. PROPERTIES OF THE MTBN-SG MODEL

In this section, we describe a number of fundamental
MTBN-SG properties which have obvious parallels to
properties of BNs. Detailed derivations can be found in
[ Aliferis et a!. 1996]. Here we provide the sketches of
proofs only.
We first show that variables in a deployed MTBN-SG
can be ordered according to their causal relations, and the
particular instantiations of the structural variables. This
will be important for both subsequent properties and

In the example of figure 3, J can be decomposed

as follows : { p(X)s1, p(X)"} . For each one of 51 and
52 we can obtain ancestral orderings. For example,
ord(S,) (A1, [A->BJ., B1, [B->CJ., CJ
=

Now we show that for each possible joint
instantiation of the structural variables, we can
factorize the joint probability distribution according

to the prior and conditional distributions of each

variable given its active parents (if any). This result
is imp ortant in terms of proving subsequent

properties, establishing a closer correspondence of
BNs and MTBNs, as well as for developing
inference algorithms.

Lemma 4.2. (MTBN factorization result). For a
joint probability distribution J of an arbitrary

MTBN-SG M., there exists a factorization of J
for each si'

Proof (sketch): By Lemma 4. 1, for each S, of M1

there exists an ancestral ordering ord(S,) on [X]. It
suffices to show that for an arbitrary S, we can
derive a factorization of the partition of J. Let the
ordered set of variables according to ord(S,) be:

{ X, . .. , x. }, s.t. all active parents of X, are to the

left of X,. Then by applying the chain rule of

probabilities, we have:
p(X,, .. , Xq) = p (Xq I x•. ,...X.) p (Xq.1 I Xq_2, .. ,XJ, ... ,
p (X.)
Using axiom 3.1 and the fact that we have an
ancestral ordering, we get: p(X., .. .Xq) =
p(Xq I c(Xq) )s1 p(Xq·t I c(Xq..) )s1., ... ,p(XJq,
or equivalently,

inference.
Lemma 4.1. (Ancestral ordering result). Let M1 be an
arbitrary well-defined MTBN-SG. The structural
constraint set on J determines a set of ancestral orderings
on [X], s.t. for each possible structureS, there exists at
least one ancestral ordering ord(S,) of [X].
Proof (sketch): The following procedure produces
ancestral orderings for each S,. Take all variable
instances over time, with no active parents and put
them first in the ordering (ties are broken
arbitrarily). Find the variables with all their active
parents already ordered and order them
subsequently (again ties are broken arbitrarily).
Repeat until no more variables are unordered. It can
be shown that this procedure terminates, that upon
termination no variables are left unordered and that
when it terminates no ordered variable comes
before any of its active parents (i.e., we have a
valid ancestral ordering) .

the same joint probability distribution as M, and

each variable in M1 has a (semantically)
corresponding variable (or set of varia6les) in B1.
Proof (outline) We employ ten MTBNs-SG to

BN, and MTBN-SG to MTBN-SG transformations
(depicted in figures 4.1 to 4.10). From Definition

3.1., each transformation captures an essential
feature of MTBN-SGs that distinguishes them from
BNs. We prove transformability for each MTBN.
To do so we utilize the following technique: The
original MTBN by definition contains a joint

33

34

probability distribution J. J can be factored
according to Lemma 4.2. We construct a BN by
defining conditional probability distributions
corresponding to the factorization of the MTBN.
By BN properties we know that we thus define a
valid BN capturing a unique joint probability
distribution. Moreover the two distributions are
identical since they are factored in the same
fashion. In the complete proof we prove that (a)
each of the transformations of figures 4 . 1 to 4.10
follow from Definition 3.1. (consistency), (b) each
of the transformations yield a valid BN or MTBN
(validity), and (c) that any MTBN can be
completely transformed to a BN (completeness). In
the remainder of the proof we generalize to the case
of MTBN-SGs employing all the features together,
and dealing with cyclic structures (see figure 4.11 ).
In all cases, we assume Tr [tl' ...,t,J, and that we
introduce in the BN n copies of each variable

indexed by j s.t.j E [t".. ,tJ

From thm 4.1. and the BN properties [Neapolitan
1 990], we immediately get the following corollaries:
Corollary 4.2. (Specification result). If we specify a

temporal graph Gt and conditional probability
distributions for all the variables, then we have defined a
unique joint probability distribution and corresponding
MTBN-SG. In this paper we do not discuss details on how
to specify generalized temporal conditional probabilities
(i.e., when for every time point a variable is determined in
the same way by its parents at that point). These can be
found in [Aliferis et al. 1 996]. There we also discuss how
to enforce the requirement for a well-defined MTBN-SG
when defining a model.
Corollary 4.3. (Expressiveness result). For every joint

probability distribution J, there exists a MTBN-SG that
can capture it.
Corollary 4.4. (Inference result). Inference with MTBN­
SGs can be carried out with any standard BN inference
algorithm by transforming an MTBN-SG to a BN.
Corollary 4.5. (Complexity result) Inference with
MTBN-SGs (exact and approximate) is NP-hard in the
general case. We note here that we have developed
temporal versions of Logic Sampling and Likelihood
Weighting for doing inference with MTBN-SGs. We have
implemented a program called HARMONY that does case
simulation and inference with MTBN-SG models. Our
program allows causal manipulations and takes advantage
of arc deactivation to avoid unnecessary computation
[Aliferis et al. 1 996].
5. MODELING TECHNIQUES

MTBNs can help in the modeling of a wide variety of
temporal and causal knowledge. We present several

simplified example application vignettes in sections 5.1.
and 5.2. In section 5 .I we discuss modeling techniques
that are fairly standard with ordinary BNs. In section 5.2.
we describe modeling that is particularly facilitated by the
MTBN-SG model's special features.
5.1. NON MTBN-SPECIFIC MODELING
TECHNIQUES
5.1.1. Representing intervals and duration of intervals

An interval in an MTBN is represented via two
random variables INT_START and INT_END, which
correspond to the endpoints of the interval. Since the start
and end of the interval are random variables, we have to
ensure that the actual (i.e., instantiated) start of an interval
will always be before its actual end. This constraint is
enforced with an arc from IN T_START to INT_END that
has an associated conditional probability distribution that
for each value V of /NT _START sets the probability of all
values of /NT_END that are smaller than V to be zero.
The duration of any particular interval is represented
by a variable INT_DUR that has a value that is the
difference between /NT_START and INT_END. Figure 5 .I
demonstrates graphically the representation for an interval
and its duration.
5.1.2. Building patterns and other temporal
abstractions

Utilizing the association of indexed variables with

corresponding time points in an MTBN model we can
build patterns and other useful abstractions. These
abstractions that are created directly from time-indexed
variables are first-order abstractions. We can build
subsequently higher-order abstractions by further
abstracting over them. For instance, consider figure 5.2.
By examining the temporally indexed variable
GLUCOSE, we can define the first-order abstraction
ELEVATED_GLUCOSE. By examining the temporally
indexed variable CHOLESTEROL, we can define the
first-order abstraction ELEVATED_CHOLESTEROL. We
then define a second-order abstraction ELEVA TED_
GLUCOSE_AND_CHOLESTEROL. As long as we define
the appropriate conditional probability distributions
correctly, there is no limit to the number. degree, and form
of abstractions we can create.
5.1.3. Facts, events

The way in which facts and events are defined and
modeled is application-dependent. For example, we can
follow Allen's classic definition of a fact as a property
that holds over all subintervals of the interval associated
with that fact [Allen 1 984]. An event could be defined as a
property of an interval that does not hold within all
subintervals (i.e., is invalid for some time point(s)).

increasing. In figure 5.5 we present an example of
examining the temporal order of two intervals. This is
accomplished by connecting the endpoint variables of
each interval with a variable INT_REL, which takes the
following values: {before, after, coincides, meets, follows,
overlaps, is_overlapped_by}. In figure 5.6 we present a
similar example modeling the relationship of a time point
to an interval.
5.1.6. Multiple reference to same entities

In an MTBN model we can have multiple
representations of the same entity. Figure 5.7 shows the
same year can be represented by two different variables
(YEAR_OF_GI_BLEEDING, YEAR_OF_WEIGHT_
LOSS). We can then examine these two to determine
whether GI bleeding and weight loss occurred during the
same time period (variable SAME_YEAR?).

5.2.1. Static and dynamic processes

Figure 5: Examples of standard BN time-modeling
techniques that apply to MTBNs as well
5.1.4. Spatio-temporal reasoning

Figure 5.3 shows a textbook example of the spatio­
temporal evolution of a disease process. In particular,
ACUTE_APPENDICITIS is typically causing pain that
starts from the right hypochondria! area and proceeds to
the right iliohypogastric area within a few hours.
NAUSEA_VOMIT are additional findings that accompany
this temporal evolution to form a temporal pattern with
high diagnostic significance.
5.1.5. Reasoning about temporal entities

Time modeling requires not only the ability to
represent temporal constructs (entities and relationships)
but also to reason about those, as well as reasoning about
time itself. In figure 5.4 we model the relationship of two
patterns of indexed lab measurements. In this example we
represent the composite fact that the HEMATOCRIT level
in a patient is returning to normal as FERITIN levels are

In MTBNs, processes are defined as composite
mechanisms that produce the values of variables in time.
As such, an MTBN graph depicts a process as a system of
interrelated components associated with temporal
probabilistic dependencies and independencies. MTBNs
facilitate explicit representation of how a process might
evolve over time. This is because individual mechanisms
within the process are activated or not at different time
points, and the time difference (lag) between causes and
effects is explicitly defined as a random variable.
5.2.2. Persistence

An important property of many variables is that they
tend to persist over time. That is, their values are not only
determined by external factors but by their previous
values. Figure 6. 1 shows an example where variable
CREATININE is not only affected by the variable
RENAL_FUNCTION, but by CREATININE at the
previous time point as well.
5.2.3. Feedback loops

Many processes in biology, medicine, economics, and
other fields, exhibit directed causal loops in which one
variable determines another one, which in turn determines
the first variable and so on. Such loops give rise to
distributions that are extremely difficult to represent with
simple BNs, unless an equilibrium state has been reached.
In MTBN-SGs, we are not restricted to modeling stable
feedback processes only. We can model any part of the
feedback process, even if no equilibrium has or can be
reached, by examining the loop over time. The behavior of
the feedback system emerges as a result of local
interactions defined by the knowledge engineer. It is in the

Aliferis and Cooper

engineer's discretion to decide between stable and

unstable feedback modeling. Figure 1 shows an example

of the use of MTBNs to model feedback. There

GLUCOSE increases the secretion of INSULIN from the
pancreas, and INSULIN causes GLUCOSE to drop due to

and quantify our belief for each of the possible

alternatives. An arc among the arcs can be used to force

them to be (concurrently) mutually exclusive. The same
technique can be used to represent reciprocal causation,

and structural uncertainty in a temporal context. That is,
we can represent mixtures of distributions that are

absorption from the body cells.

produced by causally incompatible BN processes using a

single MTBN.

5.2.5. Flexible actions/decisions and decision-theoretic
models

Due to the similarities of MTBNs to BNs and influence

diagrams (IDs), MTBNs can be readily extended to model

preferences (utilities) and to perform decision-theoretic
inference. MTBNs do not restrict us to incorporate a

1

model of the decision-maker to the domain model. This
gives the flexibility to go beyond traditional ID

conventions like the non-forgetting decision maker, the
single decision maker, and free will principles [Howard et

a!. 1 98 1]. In effect, with MTBNs, it is straightforward to
model restrictions on the availability of decision options

according to domain events, multiple decision makers, and

3

4

information loss. To keep the model's definition and

properties as simple as possible, we decided to not give
special semantic status to actions/decisions. Instead we
utilize appropriate conventions at the implementation

level.

In figure 6.3 we show an example of a modeling

convention that indicates which variables in the model are

that are facilitated by MTBNs
5.2.4. Types of uncertainty and mixtures of causal
processes

Several types of uncertainty can be represented in

MTBNs. We already showed that causal uncertainty is
represented in the form of a probabilistic causal arc from

cause to effect. Unmodeled (i.e., exogenous) uncertainty
is represented as a prior distribution of the nodes that have
no parents. Finally, interval uncertainty is modeled with
the use of random-variable interval endpoints (section

5 . 1 . 1 .).
Another important technique is when we model

uncertainty about the causal structure of the process. In

to be potentially manipulated. Variable BLOOD_
PRESSURE is such an example, and for it there is a
specially marked variable called BLOOD_ PRESSURE_
MANIP that has a deterministic relationship with
BLOOD_PRESSURE (implemented via a conditional
probability distribution that assigns to BLOOD_
PRESSURE exactly the value of BLOOD_ PRESSURE_
MANIP). The MTBN manipulation convention consists of
three rules:

(a) Causal manipulations of variables are

allowed by an inference program only through

such manipulation dummy variables.

(b) When a manipulation variable is
instantiated, every other arc (besides its own) to
the children of that variable is ignored

(deactivated).
(c) Otherwise the manipulation variable is
ignored.

In figure 6.3, we also show an example where a

variable AGE is causing CANCER (possible explanation:

figure 6.2 is an MBN. MBNs differ from BNs in that (i)
they allow arcs between arcs and (ii) arcs can have a prior
distribution. It is also evident that BNs are a subclass of
MBNs, since BNs are the class of MBNs with all arcs
instantiated to the value "active " with probability 1 .
Since these three formalisms are different i n
representational complexity, established algorithms,
commercial implementations, etc., the discrimination
among them allows us to suggest the one that may be
more appropriate for a particular task. Table 2 summarizes
the differences of the 3 formalisms. In the table we also
include standard dynamic BNs (DBNs), which is a formal
temporal extension of BNs, as a point of reference. We
note that DBNs could be viewed as a subclass of MTBN­
SGs in which there are prototypical conditional
probability functions, constant (i. e . , not explicitly
dynamic) mechanisms and lags, and all variables are
temporally indexed.
By looking at the table, we can see that BNs are more
appropriate for tasks with a single non-dynamic process.
MBNs are more suitable for mixtures of structurally
different atemporal processes (i.e., processes that can not
be causally represented by a s i ngle BN structure), as well
as for cases where it is i mportant to explicitly denote that
certain variables in the model restrict or enable the causal
influences among other variables (see sections 5 . 2 .5 , and
5.2.6 for examples). DBNs do have explicit temporal
semantics, but only one level of temporal granularity and
no abstraction. DBNs support special relationships among
variables, designed to increase efficiency by restricting the
class of relationships that are allowed to be represented.
DBNs are especially appropriate for multivariate Bayesian
time-series analysis applications where a qualitative
structure can be learned from an expert and the
appropriate parameterization from data, due to the
development of techniques for adaptation of the network
to new data instances. MTBN-SGs are appropriate for
tasks that involve temporally explicit representations,
where explicit time modeling is required, and where
mixing explicit time with abstracted time modeling can
lead to easier knowledge/data acquisition as well as
greater efficiency (due to smaller and simpler models).
7. DISCUSSION

Several extensions of BNs for time modeling have been
presented over the last few years. These include temporal
influence diagrams [Provan 1 993], dynamic BNs [Dagum
and Galper 1 993A], temporal models of endogenous
change [Hanks et al. 1 995], action networks [Darwiche et
al. 1994], embedded Markov processes [Berzuini et al.
1 992] , logic and time nets [Kanazawa 1 99 1 ] , knowledge­
based model construction methods from temporal logics
[Ngo et al. 1 995, Glesner et al. 1 995], as well as specific

applications [Polaschek et al. 1 993, Berzuini et al. 1 992].
Although many BN variants have been introduced for time
and causal modeling, many have not provided formal
semantics for the models, nor have they dealt with the
interaction of causal with temporal semantics. The lack of
such concerns can lead to models that violate fundamental
principles, such as that effects can not precede their causes
[Drudzel et al. 1 993 ] .
I n this paper w e introduced MTBNs and provided a
well-defined causal and temporal interpretation. MTBN­
SGs have some unique features relative to other temporal
BN variants. They have explicitly modeled dynamic arc
variables, and explicitly modeled lags between causes and
effects. They enforce a causal semantics on which non­
causal models are built. They utilize a condensed
graphical representation for defining and presenting a
model, and a deployed form for inference. MTBN-SGs
also facilitate the co-existence of temporally explicit (i.e.,
indexed) with implicit (i.e., abstracted - nonindexed
variables). This facilitates knowledge acquisition and
computational tractability, while maintaining the explicit
temporal semantics. In [Aliferis et al 1995] we show an
example of how explicit temporal modeling can lead to
completely intractable inference, even for models
containing a small number of variables, and how hybrid
abstraction modeling can render inference tractable (at the
expense of domain query completeness rather than
accuracy). Moreover, we emphasize that inference
algorithms for MTBNs can utilize the explicit temporal
semantics of MTBNs to validate the temporal and causal
validity of models expressed in MTBN form.
As in any modeling language, it is the match between
the language' s features and the domain, as well as the
alternative formalisms' features that will determine the
appropriateness of that particular language for a problem
domain . In the present paper, we provided definitions and
basic properties for the MTBN -SG modeling language.
We also discussed modeling techniques that are facilitated
by MTBNs, as well as modeling that is inherited from
their affinity to BNs. Weaknesses of MTBNs are that they
do not suggest or enforce any general theory of time for
decision-support systems, nor do they come with a precise
specification of a universal temporal ontology. More
importantly, their expressive power is limited by their
propositional nature and restricted description of
properties of individuals or groups of individual entities.
Thus, it is very important, as with every modeling tool or
methodology, to select the application domain after
careful consideration of the representation' s strengths and
weaknesses. We believe that MTBNs are excellent
candidates for many normative u ncertain temporal
reasoning tasks that involve prediction, diagnosis, and
optimal decision selection in complex dynamic domains.
