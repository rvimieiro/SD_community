shows that in many cases the smaller the cumulative regret,
the greater the simple regret.
We begin with background definitions and related work.
Some sampling schemes are introduced, and shown to have
better bounds for the simple regret on sets than UCB, the first
contribution of this paper. The results are applied to sampling in trees by combining the proposed sampling schemes
on the first step of a rollout with UCT for the rest of the
rollout. An additional sampling scheme based on metareasoning principles is also suggested, another contribution of
this paper. Finally, the performance of the proposed sampling schemes is evaluated on sets of Bernoulli arms, in randomly generated 2-level trees, and on the sailing domain,
showing where the proposed schemes have improved performance.

Background and Related Work
Monte-Carlo tree search was initially suggested as a scheme
for finding approximately optimal policies for Markov Decision Processes (MDP). An MDP is defined by the set of
states S, the set of actions A (also called moves in this paper), the transition distribution T (s, a, s0 ), the reward function R(s, a, s0 ), the initial state s and an optional goal
state t: (S, A, T, R, s, t) (Russell and Norvig 2003). Several
MCTS schemes explore an MDP by performing rollouts—
trajectories from the current state to a state in which a termination condition is satisfied (either the goal state, or a cutoff
state for which the reward is evaluated approximately).

Multi-armed bandits and UCT
In the Multi-armed Bandit problem (Vermorel and Mohri
2005) we have a set of K arms (see Figure 1.a). Each arm
can be pulled multiple times. Sometimes a cost is associated with each pulling action. When the ith arm is pulled,

a random reward Xi from an unknown stationary distribution is encountered. The reward is usually bounded between
0 and 1. In the cumulative setting (the focus of much of
the research literature on Multi-armed bandits), all encountered rewards are collected by the agent. The UCB scheme
was shown to be near-optimal in this respect (Auer, CesaBianchi, and Fischer 2002):
Definition 1. Scheme UCB(c) pulls arm i that maximizes
upper confidence bound bi on the reward:
s
c log(n)
bi = X i +
(1)
ni
where X i is the average sample reward obtained from arm
i, ni is the number of times arm i was pulled, and n is the
total number of pulls so far.
The UCT algorithm, an extension of UCB to Monte-Carlo
Tree Search is described in (Kocsis and Szepesvári 2006),
and shown to outperform many state of the art search algorithms in both MDP and adversarial games (Eyerich, Keller,
and Helmert 2010; Gelly and Wang 2006).
In the simple regret (selection) setting, the agent gets to
collect only the reward of the last pull.
Definition 2. The simple regret Er of a sampling policy for
the Multi-armed Bandit Problem is the expected difference
between the best true expected reward µ∗ and the true expected reward µj of the arm with the greatest sample mean,
j = arg maxi X i :
Er =

K
X
j=1

• The method is in general intractable, necessitating simplifying assumptions. However, using the standard metareasoning myopic assumption, where samples would be selected as though at most one sample can be taken before
an action is chosen, we run into serious problems. Even
the basic selection problem (Tolpin and Shimony 2012)
exhibits a non-concave utility function and results in premature stopping of the standard myopic algorithms. This
is due to the fact that the value of information of a single measurement (analogous to a sample in MCTS) is frequently less than its time-cost, even though this is not true
for multiple measurements.
When applying the selection problem to MCTS, the situation is exacerbated. The utility of an action is usually
bounded, and thus in many cases a single sample may be
insufficient to change the current best action, regardless
of its outcome. As a result, we frequently get a zero “myopic” value of information for a single sample.
• Rational metareasoning requires a known distribution
model, which may be difficult to obtain.
• Defining the time-cost of a sample is not trivial.
As the above ultimate goal is extremely difficult to
achieve, we introduce in this paper simple schemes more
amenable to analysis, loosely based on the metareasoning
concept of value of information, and compare them to UCB
(on sets) and UCT (in trees).

Sampling Based on Simple Regret

where ∆j = µ∗ − µj .
Strategies that minimize the simple regret are called pure
exploration strategies (Bubeck, Munos, and Stoltz 2011).
An upper bound on the simple regret of uniform sampling is exponentially decreasing in the number of samples
(see (Bubeck, Munos, and Stoltz 2011), Proposition 1). For
UCB(c) the best known respective upper bound on the simple regret of UCB(c) is only polynomially decreasing in the
number of samples (see (Bubeck, Munos, and Stoltz 2011),
Theorems 2,3). However, empirically UCB(c) appears to
yield a lower simple regret than uniform sampling.

Metareasoning
A completely different scheme for control of sampling can
use the principles of bounded rationality (Horvitz 1987) and
metareasoning — (Russell and Wefald 1991) provided a formal description of rational metareasoning and case studies
of applications in several problem domains. In search, under
myopic and sub-tree independence assumptions, one maintains a current best move α at the root, and finds the expected gain from finding another move β to be better than
the current best (Russell and Wefald 1991). The “cost” of
search actions can also be factored in. Ideally, an “optimal”
sampling scheme, to be used for selecting what to sample,
both at the root node (Hay and Russell 2011) and elsewhere,
can be developed using metareasoning. However, this task is
daunting for the following reasons:

Analysis of Sampling on Sets
We examine two sampling schemes with superpolynomially decreasing upper bounds on the simple
regret. The bounds suggest that these schemes achieve a
lower simple regret than uniform sampling; indeed, this is
confirmed by experiments.
We first consider ε-greedy sampling as a straightforward
generalization of uniform sampling:
Definition 3. The ε-greedy sampling scheme pulls the arm
that currently has the greatst sample mean, with probability
1−ε
0 < ε < 1, and any other arm with probability K−1
.
This sampling scheme exhibits an exponentially decreasing simple regret:
Theorem 1. For every 0 < η < 1 and γ > 1 there exists N
such that for any number of samples n > N the simple regret of the ε-greedy sampling scheme is bounded from above
as

0 < η < 1, γ > 1 there exists N such that for every n > N

ε-greedy is based solely on sampling the arm that has the
greatest sample mean (henceforth called the “current best”
arm) with a higher probability then the rest of the arms, and
ignores information about sample means of other arms. On
the other hand, UCB distributes samples in accordance with
sample means, but, in order to minimize cumulative regret,
chooses the current best arm too often. Intuitively, a better scheme for simple regret minimization would distribute
samples in a way similar to UCB, but would sample the current best arm less often. This can be achieved by replacing
log(·) in Equation√1 with a faster growing sublinear function, for example, ·.

Sampling in Trees
As mentioned above, UCT (Kocsis and Szepesvári 2006) is
an extension of UCB for MCTS, that applies UCB(c) at each
step of a rollout. At the root node, the sampling in MCTS is
usually aimed at finding the first move to perform. Search
is re-started, either from scratch or using some previously
collected information, after observing the actual outcome (in
MDPs) or the opponent’s move (in adversarial games). Once
one move is shown to be the best choice with high confidence, the value of information of additional samples of the
best move (or, in fact, of any other samples) is low. Therefore, one should be able to do better than UCT by optimizing
simple regret, rather than cumulative regret, at the root node.
Nodes deeper in the search tree are a different matter.
In order to support an optimal move choice at the root, it

is beneficial in many cases to find a more precise estimate
of the value of the state in these search tree nodes. For
these internal nodes, optimizing simple regret is not the answer, and cumulative regret optimization is not so far off
the mark. Lacking a complete metareasoning for sampling,
which would indicate the optimal way to sample both root
nodes and internal nodes, our suggested improvement to
UCT thus combines different sampling schemes on the first
step and during the rest of each rollout:
Definition 5. The SR+CR MCTS sampling scheme selects
an action at the current root node according to a scheme
suitable for minimizing the simple regret (SR), such as 21 greedy or UCB√· , and (at non-root nodes) then selects actions according to UCB, which approximately minimizes the
cumulative regret (CR).
The pseudocode of this two-stage rollout for an undiscounted MDP is in Algorithm 1: F IRSTACTION selects the
first step of a rollout (line 5), and N EXTACTION (line 6)
selects steps during the rest of the rollout (usually using
UCB). The reward statistic for the selected action is updated
(line 10), and the sample reward is back-propagated (line 11)
towards the current root.
We denote such two-step realizations of SR+CR as
Alg+UCT, where Alg is the sampling scheme employed at
the first step of a rollout (e.g. 21 -greedy+UCT).
Algorithm 1 Two-stage Monte-Carlo tree search sampling

+ ROLLOUT(next-node, depth+1)
10:
U PDATE S TATS(node, action, reward)
11:

12:
end if
13: end procedure
We expect such two-stage sampling schemes to outperform UCT and be significantly less sensitive to the tuning of the exploration factor c of UCB(c). That is since
the contradiction between the need for a larger value of c
on the first step (simple regret) and a smaller value for the
rest of the rollout (cumulative regret) (Bubeck, Munos, and
Stoltz 2011) is resolved. In fact, a sampling scheme that uses
UCB(c) at all steps but a larger value of c for the first step
than for the rest of the steps, should also outperform UCT.

VOI-aware Sampling
Further improvement can be achieved by computing or estimating the value of information (VOI) of the rollouts and
choosing rollouts that maximize the VOI. However, as indicated above, actually computing the VOI is infeasible. Instead we suggest the following scheme based on the following features of value of information:

1. An estimate of the probability that one or more rollouts
will make another action appear better than the current
best α.
2. An estimate of the gain that may be incurred if such a
change occurs.
If the distribution of results generated by the rollouts were
known, the above features could be easily computed. However, this is not the case for most MCTS applications. Therefore, we estimate bounds on the feature values from the current set of samples, based on the myopic assumption that the
algorithm will only sample one of the actions, and use these
bounds as the feature values, to get:
V OIα

α = arg max X i , β = arg max X i
i

i, i6=α

with V OIα being the (approximate) value for sampling the
current best action, and V OIi is the (approximate) value for
sampling some other action i.
These equations were derived as follows. The gain from
switching from the current best action α to another action
can be bounded: by the current expectation of the value
the current second-best action for the case where we sample only α, and by 1 (the maximum reward) minus the current expectation of α when sampling any other action. The
probability that another action be found best can be bounded
by an exponential function of the difference in expectations
when the true value of the actions becomes known. But the
effect of each individual sample on the sample mean is inversely proportional to the current number of samples, hence
the current number of samples (plus one in order to handle
the initial case of no previous samples) in the denominator.
These VOI estimates are used in the “VOI-aware” sampling scheme as follows: sample the action that has maximum estimated VOI. We judged these estimates to be too
crude to be used as “stopping criteria” that can be used to
cut off sampling, leaving this issue for future research. Although this scheme appears too complicated to be amenable
to a formal analysis, early experiments (Section ) with this
approach demonstrate a significantly lower simple regret.

Empirical Evaluation
The results were empirically verified on Multi-armed Bandit instances, on search trees, and on the sailing domain, as
defined in (Kocsis and Szepesvári 2006). In most cases, the
experiments showed a lower average simple regret for 12 greedy an UCB√· than for UCB on sets, and for the SR+CR
scheme than for UCT in trees.

Simple regret in multi-armed bandits
Figure 1 presents a comparison of MCTS sampling schemes
on Multi-armed bandits. Figure 1.a shows the search tree
corresponding to a problem instance. Each arm returns a random reward drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. The search

selects an arm and compares the expected reward, unknown
to the algorithm during the sampling, to the expected reward
of the best arm.
Figure 1.b shows the regret vs. the number of samples,
averaged over 10000 experiments for randomly generated
instances of 32 arms. Either 21 -greedy or UCB√· dominate
UCB over the whole range. For larger number of samples,
the advantage of UCB√· over 12 -greedy becomes more significant.

The second set of experiments was performed on randomly
generated 2-level max-max trees crafted so as to deliberately deceive uniform sampling (Figure 2.a), necessitating
an adaptive sampling scheme, such as UCT. That is due to
the switch nodes, each with 2 children with anti-symmetric
values, which would cause a uniform sampling scheme to
incorrectly give them all a value of 0.5.
Simple regret vs. the number of samples are shown
for trees with root degree 16 (Figure 2.b) and 64 (Figure 2.c). The exploration factor c is set to 2, the default
value for rewards in the range [0, 1]. The algorithms exhibit a similar relative performance: either 12 -greedy+UCT
or UCB√· +UCT result in the lowest regret, UCB√· +UCT
dominates UCT everywhere except when the number of
samples is small. The advantage of both 12 -greedy+UCT and
UCB√· +UCT grows with the number of arms.

The sailing domain
Figures 3–5 show results of experiments on the sailing domain. Figure 3 shows the regret vs. the number of samples, computed for a range of values of c. Figure 3.a
shows the median cost, and Figure 3.b — the minimum
costs. UCT is always worse than either 12 -greedy+UCT or
UCB√· +UCT, and is sensitive to the value of c: the median cost is much higher than the minimum cost for UCT.

Conclusion and Future Work
UCT-based Monte-Carlo tree search has been shown to be
very effective for finding good actions in both MDPs and
adversarial games. Further improvement of the sampling
scheme is thus of interest in numerous search applications.
We argue that although UCT is already very efficient, one
can do better if the sampling scheme is considered from a
metareasoning perspective of value of information (VOI).
The MCTS SR+CR scheme presented in the paper differs from UCT mainly in the first step of the rollout, when
we attempt to minimize the ‘simple’ selection regret rather
than the cumulative regret. Both the theoretical analysis and
the empirical evaluation provide evidence for better general
performance of the proposed scheme.
Although SR+CR is inspired by the notion of VOI, the
VOI is used there implicitly in the analysis of the algorithm, rather than computed or learned explicitly in order

to plan the rollouts. Ideally, using VOI to control sampling
ab-initio should do even better, but the theory for doing that
is still not up to speed. Instead we suggest a “VOI-aware”
sampling scheme based on crude probability and value estimates, which despite its simplicity already shows a marked
improvement in minimizing regret. However, application of
the theory of rational metareasoning to Monte Carlo Tree
Search is an open problem (Hay and Russell 2011), and both
a solid theoretical model and empirically efficient VOI estimates need to be developed.
Finding a better sampling scheme for non-root nodes, as
well as the root node, should also be possible. Although cumulative regret does reasonably well there, it is far from
optimal, as meta-reasoning principles imply that an optimal
scheme for these nodes must be asymmetrical (e.g. it is not
helpful to find out that the value of the current best action is
even better than previously believed).
Finally, applying VOI methods in complex deployed applications that already use MCTS is a challenge that should
be addressed in future work. In particular, UCT is extremely successful in Computer Go (Gelly and Wang 2006;
Braudiš and Loup Gailly 2011; Enzenberger and Müller
2009), and the proposed scheme should be evaluated on this
domain. This is non-trivial, since Go programs typically use
“non-pure” versions of UCT, extended with domain-specific
knowledge. For example, Pachi (Braudiš and Loup Gailly
2011) typically re-uses information from rollouts generated
for earlier moves, thereby violating our underlying assumption that information is only used for selecting the current
move. In early experiments not shown here (disallowing reuse of samples, admittedly not really a fair comparison) the
VOI-aware scheme apears to dominate UCT. Nevertheless,
it should also be possible to adapt the VOI-aware schemes to
take into account expected re-use of samples, another topic
for future research.
