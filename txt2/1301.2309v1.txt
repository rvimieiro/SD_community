Collaborative filtering (CF) is the process of making

predictions whether a user will prefer a particular item,

given his or her ratings on other items and given other
people's ratings on various items including the one in
question. CF relies on the fact that people's prefer­
ences are not randomly distributed; there are patterns
within the preferences of a person and among simi­

lar groups of people, creating correlation. The user
for whom we are predicting a rating is called the ac­

Our approach is to predict a user's prefer­

tive user. In collaborative filtering, the main premise

Collaborative filtering has been an active area of re­
search in recent years.

Several collaborative filter­

ing algorithms have

suggested, ranging from bi­

been

nary to non-binary rating, implicit and explicit rating.
Initial collaborative filtering algorithms were based
on statistical methods using correlation between user
preferences [Resnick, Iacovou, Suchak, Bergstrom and
Riedl, 1994; Shardanand and Maes, 1995]. These cor­
relation based algorithms predict the active user rat­
ings as a similarity-weighted sum of the other users
ratings.

These algorithms are also referred to as

memory based algorithms [Breese, Heckerman and
Kadie, 1998]. Collaborative filtering is different to the
standard supervised learning task because there are

only two attributes, each with a large domain; it is
the structure within the domains that are important
to the prediction, but this structure is not provided ex­
plicitly. Recently, some researchers have used machine
learning methods [Breese et al., 1998; Ungar and Fos-

ter, 1998) for collaborative filtering algorithms. These
methods essentially discover the hidden attributes for
users and items, which explain the similarity between
users and items.
Breese et al. [Breese et a!., 1998] proposed and eval­
uated two probabilistic models for model based col­
laborative filtering algorithms: cluster models and
Bayesian networks. In the cluster model, users with
similar preferences are clustered together into classes.
The model's parameters, the number of clusters, and
the conditional probability of ratings given a class are
estimated from the training data. In the Bayesian net­
work, nodes correspond to items in the database. The
training data is used to learn the network structure
and the conditional probabilities.

called personality diagnosis (P D) and showed that
PD makes better predictions than other memory and
model based algorithms. This algor ithm is b ased on a
probabilistic model of how people rate items, which is
similar to our noisy sensor model approach.

In this paper we propose and evaluate a probabilis­
tic approach based on a noisy sensor model, which is
symmetric between users and items. Our approach is
based on the idea that to predict an active user's rating
for a particular item, we can use all those people who
rated that item and other items rated by the active
user as the noisy sensors. We view the noisy sensor
model as a belief network. The conditional probabil­
ity table associated with each sensor reflects the noise
in the sensor.
To model how another user (user u) can act as a noisy
sensor for the active user a's rating, we need to find a
relationship between their preferences. Unfortunately,
there is usually very little data, so we need to make a
priori some assumptions about the relationship. Here
we give two variants of the general idea for learning
the noisy sensor model for explicit multi-valued rat­
ing data: one, where we learn a classical normal lin­
ear regression model of how users rate items ( Noisyl) ;
and another, where we assume that the different users
rate items the same and learn the accuracy of the sen­
sor(Noisy2).
In

order to avoid a perfect fit wi th sparse data we add
some dummy points before fitting the relationship. We
use hierarchical prior to distribute the effect of dummy
points over all possible rating pairs.
After learning the noisy sensor model (i.e. the con­
ditional probability table associated with each sensor
node), we use Bayes' theorem to compute the proba­
bility distribution of the user a's rating of a new item.

We evaluate both Noisyl and Noisy2 on the Each­
Movie database of movie ratings and compare them
to the state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that
symmetric collaborative filtering, which employs both
user and item similarity, offers better accuracy than
asymmetric collaborative filtering.

Mathematical Notation

Let N be the number of users and M be the total num­
ber of items in the database. S is an N x M matrix of
all user's ratings for all items; Sui is the rating given
by user u to item i. Let the ratings be on a cardi­
nal scale with m values that we denote v1, v2, .. . , Vm·
Then each rating Sui has a domain of possible values
(v1,v2,
, vm ) · In collaborative filtering, S, the user­
item matrix, is ge ner ally very sparse since each user
will only have rated a small percentage of the total
number of items. Under this formulation, the collabo­
rative filtering problem becomes predicting those Sui
which are not defined in S, the user -item matrix.

Collaborative Filtering Using the

Noisy Sensor Model

We propose a simple probabilistic approach for sym­
metric collaborative filtering using the noisy sensor
model for predicting the rating by user a (active user)
of an item j. We use as noisy sensors:
•

all users who rated the item j

•

all items rated by user

a

The sensor model is depicted as a naive Bayesian net­
work in Figure 1. The direction of the arrow shows
that the prediction of user a for item j causes the sen­
sor u to take on a particular prediction for item j. The
sensor model is the conditional probability table asso­
ciated with each sensor node. The noise in the sensor
is reflected by the probability of incorrect prediction;
that is, by the conditional probability table associated
with it. To keep the model simple we use the indepen­
dence assumption that the prediction of any sensor for
item j is independent of others, given the prediction
of user a for item j.
We need the following probabilities for Figure 1:
P r (SuiiSaj) : the probability of user u's prediction
for item j, given the prediction of user a for item j.

to find a straight line which best fits these points. We
assume that the mean of y can be expressed as a lin­

Consider first the problem of estimating Pr (Sui ISai ) ,
which is the problem of estimating user u's rating for
item j given user a's rating of it. There is typically
sparse data for the m x m probability table and we
need to make some prior assumptions about the rela­
tionship. We assume that there is a linear relation­
ship with Gaussian error between the preferences of
users and, similarly, between the ratings received by
the items. Suppose the rating of user a (the indepen­
dent variable) is denoted by x, and t hat the rating of
user u (the dependent variable) is denoted by y. Sup­
pose that user a and user u co- rated n it ems and their
ratings over n co-rated items are denoted by n pairs of

The problem with

Noisyl is that

we must often fit lin­

ear relationships with very little data (co-rated items).
It may be better to assume a priori the linear model
and then simply learn the noise. The algorithm

same and, similarly, different items receive the same
rating. We assume that the preferences of user a and

by making the regression coefficients a = 0 and /3 = 1.
In this model we need to compute (u + i) free param­
eters (a2), where u is the number of users who rated
the item j and i is the number of items rated by user
a. We also add the K dummy observations because
the same problem (as discussed in Subsection 3.1) can
arise in Noisy2. We have experimented with parame­
ter K, and we found that Noisy2 also performs better
with K

fore, chose K = 1 for Noisy2 also.

In Noisy2 we are not fitting the relationship between
user a and user u, but we assume an equal relation­
ship. So, it doesn't make sense to use the coefficient of
determination r2 for finding the reliability of the noisy
sensors. Rather, to find the reliability of the noisy sen­
sor, we use the variance; the less variance, the more
reliable the noisy sensor. We use the best U user noisy
sensors and best I item noisy sensors for making the
predictions. The parameter settings for U and I are
explained in the next section.

Evaluation Framework

To evaluate the accuracy of collaborative filtering al­
gorithms we used the training and test set approach.
In this approach, the dataset of users (and their rat­
ings) is divided into two: a training set and a test set.
The training set is used as the collaborative filtering
dataset. The test set is used to evaluate the accuracy
of the collaborative filtering algorithm. We treat each
user from the test set as the active user. To carry out
testing, we divide the ratings by each test user into two
sets: Ia and Pa. The set Ia contains ratings that we
treat as observed ratings. The set Pa contains the rat­
ings that we attempt to predict using a CF algorithm
and observed ratings (Ia) and training set.
To evaluate the accuracy of the collaborative filtering
algorithm we use the average absolute deviation met­
ric, as it is the most commonly used metric [Breese
et al., 1998]. The lower the average absolute deviation,
the more accurate the collaborative filtering algorithm
is. For all users in the test set we calculate the average
absolute deviation of the predicted rating against the
actual rating of items. Let the number of predicted
ratings in the test set for the active user be na; then
the average absolute deviation for a user is given as
follows:

Sa=

,;, LjEPa IPa,j- ra,jl,

where Pai is user a's observed rating for item j and raj
is user a's predicted rating for item j.
These absolut e deviations are
users in the test set.

Data and protocols

We compared both versions of our noisy sensor model
to PD (Personality Diagnosis) [Pennock et al., 2000]
and Correlation (Pearson Correlation) [Resnick et al.,
1994]. To compare the performance we used the same
subset of the EachMovie database as used by Breese et
al. [Breese et al., 1998] and Pennock et al. [Pennock
et al., 2000], consisting of 1,623 movies, 381,862 rat­
ings, 5,000 users in the training set, and 4,119 users
in the test set. In EachMovie database the ratings are
elicited on a integer scale from zero to five. We also
tested the algorithms on other subsets to verify that
we are not finding peculiarities of the subset.
We ran experiments with different amounts of ratings
in set Ia to understand the effect of the amount of
the observed ratings on the prediction accuracy of
the collaborative filt ering algorithm. As in [Breese
et al., 1998] for the AllBut1 Protocol, we put a sin­
gle randomly selected rating for each test user in the
test set Pa and the rest of the ratings in the observed
set I<+. As in [Breese et al., 1998] for each GivenX Pro­
tocol, we place X ratings randomly for each test user
in the observed set Ia, and the rest of the ratings in
the test set Pa. We did the experiments for X = 2, 5
and 10.
4.2

Selecting Noisy Sensors

After learning the noisy sensor model we determine
which noisy sensors should be used in making the pre­
dic tion for the active user. Figure 2 shows the varia­
tion of average absolute deviation with best user noisy
sensors for different numbers of best item noisy sensors
for Noisy1. We used the dataset as described above
but the test rating and the observed ratings for each
user of the test set were selected randomly.
Figute 2 shows that the average absolute deviation de­

creases with the increase in number of item sensors.
There is no significant improvement in accuracy when
the number of item sensors is more than twenty. It
also shows that the average absolute deviation first
decreases with the increase in number of user sensors
and then increases as more user sensors are used for
prediction. This is because the large number of user
sensors results in too much noise for those user sensors
that have good reliability.
From the experiments, we found that both algo­
rithms give better performances with ten-to-twenty
item noisy sensors and forty-to-seventy user noisy sen­
sors 2• For the experiments reported in the following
section, we use the best fifty user noisy sensors and
2We didn't use the test set for finding the number of
user and item noisy sensors.

Noisy1's poor performance can be explained by the
fact the lines that are fitted to very small data sets
are often poor fit to the actual relationship. The algo­
rithm Noisy2, based on an equal relationship between
users, doesn't suffer from the same problem, and out­
performed all algorithms under all protocols.

and I depend on the database. In the case of the Each­

movies, also each user has rated only few movies. Due
to this possibility more best user noisy sensors (U) are
selected than the b est item noisy sensors (I).

From Figure 2 we also see that the minimum aver­
age absolute deviation is .936 when we use both user
and item noisy sensors (with sixty user and twenty
item noisy sensors). It is .964 when we use only the
user noisy sensors, shown by the zero item noisy sen­
sors case, and 1.027 when we use only the item noisy
sensors, shown on the y-axis for ten item noisy sen­
sors. This indicates that when we include the item
noisy sensors along with the user noisy sensors, the
quality of the prediction improves considerably. It
also shows that if we use only the item noisy sensors
for prediction, then the average absolute deviation be­
comes greater than when we use only user noisy sen­
sors. Therefore, symmetric collaborative filtering of­
fers better accuracy than asymmetric collaborative fil­
tering.

Shardanand and Maes [Shardanand and Maes, 1995]
and Pennock et al. [Pennock et al., 2000] proposed
that the accuracy of a collaborative filtering algorithm
should be evaluated on extreme ratings (very high or
very low ratings) for items. The supposition is that,
most of the time, people are interested in suggestions
about items they might like or dislike, but not about
items they are unsure of. Pennock et al. [Pennock
et al., 2000] defined the extreme ratings as those which
are 0.5 above and 0.5 below the average rating in the
subset. To compare the performance of algorithms
with extreme ratings we computed the predicted rat­
ings for those test cases from the test set Pa of all
protocols, whose observed rating is less than R- 0.5
or greater than R + 0.5, where R is the overall average
rating in the subset.

To determine the statistical significance of these re­
sults, we computed the significance levels for the dif­
ferences in average absolute deviation between Noisy1
and PD, PD and Noisy1, Noisy2 and PD, and PD and
Noisy2for all protocols. To do this, we divided the test
set for all protocols into 60 samples of equal size and
used randomization paired sample test of differences of
means [Cohen, 1995]. This method calculates the sam­
pling distribution of the mean difference between two
algorithms by repeatedly shuffling and recalculating
the mean difference in 10,000 different permutations.
The shuffling reverses the sign of the difference score
for each sample with a probability of .5.
The statistical significance results of the EachMovie
data results are shown in Table 3; it shows the prob­
ability of achieving a difference less than or equal to
the mean difference. That is, it shows the probability
of incorrectly rejecting the n ull hypothesis that both
algorithms' deviation scores arise from the same dis­
tribution.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have concerned ourselves with sym­
metric collaborative filtering based on explicit ratings

used for making recommendations to a user based on
ratings of various items by a number of people, and
the user's ratings of various items.
We have described a new probabilistic approach for
symmetric collaborative filtering based on a noisy sen­
sor model. We have shown that the noisy sensor model
makes better predictions than other state-of-the-art
techniques. The results for Noisy2 are highly statis­
tically significant. We have also shown that by includ­
ing the items similarity along with users similarity, the
accuracy of prediction increases. This paper has only
considered the accuracy of the noisy sensor model, not
on the computational issues involved. It is beyond the
scope of this paper to consider the trade-off between
off-line and online computation and effective indexing
to find the best matches.
