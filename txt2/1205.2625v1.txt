A key challenge in both the MAP and marginals case
is to devise simple and scalable algorithms for solving the variational optimization problem. In recent
years numerous algorithms have been introduced for
both tasks. These algorithms typically have a “message passing like” structure.
Perhaps the most widely used message-passing algorithms are “belief propagation” and its generalizations [5, 8, 12, 14]. These algorithms typically have two
variants: sum-product which is used to approximate
the marginals, and max-product which is used to approximate the MAP. Fixed-points of these algorithms
can be shown to be local (or sometimes even global)
optima of the corresponding variational formulation.
Yet despite the spectacular empirical success of these
algorithms in real-world applications, they are not
guaranteed to converge, and variants of “dampening”
are often used to improve their convergence [8, 12, 14].
There has therefore been much recent work on convergent message passing algorithms [2, 5, 7, 13]. These algorithms are often very similar in structure to the nonconvergent algorithms and often include local maxproduct or sum-product operations. However, for each
of these specific algorithms it has been possible to
prove that the value of the variational problem (or its
dual) improves at each iteration. Perhaps the most intriguing example of this is Kolmogorov’s TRW-S algorithm [7] which is simply Wainwright’s tree-reweighted
max-product algorithm [11] with a different update
schedule.
Here we introduce a unifying framework which encompasses both marginals and MAP approximations,
by exploiting the mathematical similarities between
these approximations. Specifically, we provide an up-

per bound on the optimum of the variational approximations, and give sufficient conditions that algorithms
need to satisfy in order to decrease this bound in a
monotone fashion. Any algorithm which satisfies these
conditions is guaranteed to decrease the upper bound
at every iteration. This property in turn guarantees
that such algorithms converge to a global optimum of
the variational problem in the marginals case and to a
local optimum in the MAP LP approximation case.
Our framework involves updating a subset of regions
which form a tree in the region graph. A related approach was recently suggested by Sontag et al. [9]
in the context of solving the MAP approximation.
Their work gives an explicit algorithm for optimizing
all edges corresponding to a tree in the original graph,
such that an upper bound on the LP optimum is decreased at every iteration. Our formalism does not give
an explicit update but rather conditions that guarantee an update to decrease the objective. However,
we show that these conditions are satisfied by several
known algorithms. Furthermore, since the condition
is similar in the marginals and MAP case (specifically
a condition of sum and max consistency respectively)
it is easy to obtain algorithms for both these cases simultaneously, and to use results in one problem for
obtaining algorithms for the other.
For instance, we consider the tree-reweighted (TRW)
free energy minimization problem [12]. Recently two
works have provided convergent algorithms for this
problem [1, 3], but these were more involved than standard message passing algorithms. Here we show the
surprising result that in fact the original algorithm
provided for TRW by Wainwright et al. is convergent, if run with an appropriate schedule of message
updates.

Bounds for MAP and Log-Partition

We consider a graphical model where the joint probability over variables p(x) factors
Q into a product over
clique potentials p(x) = Z1 α Ψα (xα ) or equivalently, the energy function
is a sum over clique enP
1
ergies p(x)
=
θ
(xα )). We also denote
exp(
α
α
Z
P
θ(x) = α θα (xα ).
The problem of calculating marginals and approximation of the partition function Z can be recast as the
following maximization problem of the function F (q)
(the negative of the free energy):
log Z = max F (q) = max (hθ(x)iq + H(q))
q

q

(1)

where q is the set of probability distributions over x,
hθ(x)iq is the average energy with respect to q and
H(q) is the entropy function. The maximizing argu-

UAI 2009

ment is then the distribution p(x).
This maximization is in general intractable, so approximate free energies are often used. A class of approximate free energies, discussed in [14], is based on the
concept of a region graph G whose nodes α are regions
of the original graph, and whose edges represent subregion relationships (i.e. an edge between α in β exists
only if β ⊂ α). The approximation replaces the joint
entropy H(q) with a linear combination of local region
entropies Hα (qα ) where each local entropy is weighted
by a “double-counting” number cα :
H̃G,c (q) =

X

cα Hα (qα ) ,

(2)

α

where the subscript G, c indicates the dependence of
the approximation on the region graph G and the
counting numbers cα .
With this approximation of H(q) the free energy now
only depends on local distributions, since the average energyPis a simple function of the qα , namely
hθ(x)iq =
α hθα (xα )iqα . To optimize only over local distributions qα , we need to consider only distributions such that there exists a q(x) that has these as
marginals. This set (called the marginal polytope [10])
cannot be expressed in a compact form, and is typically approximated. One popular approximation is the
local polytope of the region graph L(G) defined as the
set of local distributions that agree on the marginals
for any two regions in the region graph that are subsets
of each other:1
P

(
∀β ⊂ α, xβ
qα (xα ) = qβ (xβ )
xα \xβ
L(G) = q ≥ 0
P
∀α,
xα qα (xα ) = 1
Take together, this results in the following standard
variational approximation [10]:
X
max F̃ (q) = max
hθα (xα )iqα + H̃G,c (q) (3)
q∈L(G)

q∈L(G)

Similarly the MAP problem is approximated via
X
max F̃ (q) = max
hθα (xα )iqα
q∈L(G)

q∈L(G)

To obtain a unified formalism for MAP and marginals,
we use a temperature parameter T where T = 1 for
marginals and T = 0 for MAP and the optimization
is:
X
max F̃ (q) = max
hθα (xα )iqα + T H̃G,c (q) (5)

Positive Counting Numbers

The entropy approximation H̃G,c (q) in Eq. 2 is generally not a concave function of the local distributions q.
Thus maximization of F̃ (q) may result in local optima.
To avoid this undesirable property, several works (e.g.,
[5]) have focused on entropies which are obtained by
considering only concave H̃G,c (q) functions. We focus on approximations where all the double counting
numbers are non-negative. This is a strong restriction
but since we are working with a region graph formulation, many approximate free energies which have negative double counting numbers can be transformed into
ones with positive double counting numbers on a region graph. Perhaps the most important example are
tree-reweighted free energies inPwhich the entropy is
approximated as HT RBP (q) = τ ρτ Hτ (q) with ρτ a
probability distribution over trees in the graph and
Hτ (q) is the entropy of the distribution on τ with
marginals given by q (more precisely, the projection
of q on the tree τ ). If we consider a region graph
with trees and their intersection (Fig. 5) the double
counting numbers are non-negative.

case, the double-counting number for the singletons
ci may be negative. However, we will show that it is
sometimes advantageous to work in the representation
that uses a non-negative mixture of trees, since nonnegativity of the counting numbers allows a simpler
derivation of algorithms.
2.2

Optimization and Reparameterization

The vast majority of methods for solving the variational approximation are based on two classes of
constraints that local optima should satisfy. It is
easy to show using Lagrange multipliers, that local optima of F̃ should satisfy two types of constraints [5, 6, 12, 14, 15]
• Reparametrization Q
(or admissibility, or “e constraints”). P (x) ∝ α qα (xα )cα , for every x.

• sum-consistency
(or
“m
constraints”),
P
xα \xβ qα (xα ) = qβ (xβ ) for all β ⊂ α and
xβ .

By enforcing each of these constraints iteratively one
obtains many of the popular sum-product algorithms.
Replacing the sum-consistency constraint with maxconsistency gives many of the popular max-product
algorithms. A simple example is ordinary BP, which
maintains admissiblity at each iteration and a message
from i to j enforces consistency between bij and bj .

395

In general, simply iteratively enforcing constraints is
not guaranteed to give convergent algorithms. However, as we show in this paper, by iterating through
the constraints in a particular order, we obtain monotonically convergent algorithms.
2.3

Bound minimization and
reparameterizations

We begin by providing an upper bound on the logpartition function whose minimization is equivalent to
the maximization in Eq. 5.
We consider marginals bα of the exponential form:
bα (xα ; θ̃α ) =



1
exp θ̃α (xα )/cα
Zθ̃α

(6)

and require that these marginals will be admissible
(maintain the “e constraints”). We obtain admissibility by requiring that the variables θ̃ will satisfy the
following for each x:
X
X
θα (xα ) =
θ̃α (xα )
(7)
α

α

The algorithms we propose will optimize over the variables θ̃ while keeping the constraint in Eq. 7 satisfied
at all times. Moreover, they will monotonically decrease an upper bound on the optimum of Eq. 5. In
the following two lemmas we provide this bound for
the sum and max cases.
Lemma 1 The approximation to the log partition
function is bounded above by:
X
boundsum (θ̃) =
(8)
cα ln Zθ̃α
α

for any reparameterization θ̃ (i.e., any θ̃ satisfying
Eq. 7).
Minimizing boundsum (θ̃) over the set of reparameterizations θ̃ would give the approximated log-partition
function:
min boundsum (θ̃) = max F̃ (q)
θ̃

q∈L(G)

(9)

This is the optimum of Eq. 5 with T = 1.
Proof: Kolmogorov [7] showed that if θ̃ is a reparameterization (i.e. keeping the constraint in Eq. 7), it also
holds that hθ̃iq = hθiq for any q ∈ L(G). Using this
property, we can see that the log-partition function is
constant under reparameterization: F̃ (q; θ) = F̃ (q; θ̃)
for any q ∈ L(G), and in particular the maximum value

will remain the same. Now, using the new variables θ̃
we have a trivial bound on the log-partition:

from the admissiblity constraint so that maxx α θ̃α (xα ) ≤

coincides with the LP relaxation was proven in [13].
We note that the above two lemmas may also be
viewed as an outcome of convex duality. In other
words, the original variational maximization problem
and the equivalent bound minimization problem are
convex duals of each other.
In the following sections we provide a framework for
deriving minimization algorithms for the above two
bounds.

the approximated negative free energy F̃ (q; θ) does not
happen at an extreme point [14].

Bound optimization and consistency

We propose the tree consistency bound optimization
(TCBO) algorithm as a general framework for minimizing the bounds in Sec. 2.3 for the approximated
log-partition and for the MAP, within a region graph
with positive counting numbers cα .
The idea is to perform updates on trees that are subgraphs of the region-graph. The θ̃ corresponding to
each such tree will be updated simultaneously in a way
that will achieve a monotone decrease in the bound.
The method we propose, as described in Algorithm 1
keeps the beliefs admissible with the positive counting numbers cα (or equivalently, always maintains θ̃(x)
that reparameterize the original energy θ(x)). The corresponding θ̃ thus satisfy the conditions of the bound
in Sec. 2.3. Furthermore, at each iteration, max or sum
consistency of the beliefs is enforced for the subtree T .
As mentioned earlier, maintaining consistency on subsets does not generally result in convergent algorithms.
However, as the following lemmas show, in our case
enforcing consistency is equivalent to block coordinate

descent on the bound.
Lemma 3 The sum-consistency lemma: Consider the bound minimization problem for the logpartition function with positive counting numbers
(Lemma 1), defined on a subset of regions and intersections T . The part of the bound which is influenced
by the beliefs of the subset is:
X
P BT (θ̃T ) =

The problem is to find {θ̃α } for all α ∈ T that minimize

Now, if we find variables θ̃α for all α ∈ T such
that they provide global re-parameterization θ̃(x) =
θ(x) (so we can have a bound), and the marginals
bα (xα ; θ̃α ) ∝ exp(θ̃α (xα )/cα ) which maximize each
term Fα (qα ; θ̃α , cα ) separately are also sum-consistent
(bT ∈ L(G)), then P BT (θ̃T ) will achieve its optimal
value, and thus we perform block coordinate descent
on the bound.
Note that for optimizing the bound to the logpartition, the subset T does not have to form a tree,
and the sum-consistency of the beliefs is enough. Yet,
it may be easier in practice to enforce sum-consistency
on trees.
Lemma 4 The max-consistency lemma: Consider the bound minimization problem for MAP with
positive counting numbers (Lemma 2), defined on a

so if we can find an assignment x∗T whose cost θ̃T (x∗T )

bound. Now, if for some

liefs bα (xα ; θ̃α∗ ) ∝ exp θ̃α∗ /cα are max-marginalizable
then we can always find an assignment x∗T that sits on
the maxima of θ̃α∗ because the subgraph is a tree (so
there cannot be any frustrations). Hence, we obtain
θ̃T (x∗T ) = P BT (θ̃T∗ ), and the bound achieves its optimal value for the coordinates in T .
The above two lemmas show that the TCBO algorithm
monotonically decreases the bound after each update.
In the log-partition case, the bound is strictly convex
and thus this strategy finds the global minimum of
the bound which is the global maximum of Eq. 5. In
the MAP case, the function is not strictly convex and
the algorithm may converge to values that are not its
global optimum. This phenomenon is shared by most
dual descent algorithms (e.g., [2, 7, 13]).
TCBO is a general scheme and can be implemented
for different choices of tree sub-graphs. In the next
section we illustrate some possible choices and their
relation to known algorithms.

Existing bound minimizing
algorithms

We identify some existing convergent algorithms as instances of TCBO: Heskes’ algorithm [5] for approximating the marginals, and MPLP [2],TRW-S [7], maxsum diffusion (MSD) [13] for approximating MAP.
Figures 2-5 show the reparametrization, region graph
and the tree sub-graph updated at each iteration of
these algorithms, for the simple example of a 2x2
grid shown in Fig. 1. Note that all algorithms use
a reparameterization with positive double counting
numbers. Furthermore, they update only a subtree at

a time. What remains to be shown is that each iteration achieves consistency among the beliefs (in other
words, it satisfies the conditions of TCBO framework
and thus monotonically decreases the corresponding
upper bound).
Heskes’ algorithm can be shown to be an instance of
TCBO using direct substitution. The update rules are
shown in algorithm 3. MPLP (algorithm 4) does not
appear at first sight to use the region graph illustrated
in Fig. 4, but rather works with edges and singletons.
However, as we show in the appendix, there is a way
to transform the messages used in the max-product
version of Heskes’s algorithm into messages of MPLP
using the MPLP region graph. The max-consistency
achieved by MSD (algorithm 2) can again be shown
directly.
It is also possible to use tree graphs (or forests) as
regions, and various existing methods indeed use this
approach. We may consider a TCBO algorithm which
iterates through all edges and nodes, and for each edge
or node enforces consistency between it and all trees
that contain it. This is illustrated in Fig. 5. A naive

implementation of such a scheme is costly, as it requires multiple tree updates for every edge. However,
Kolmogorov [7] showed that there exists an efficient
implementation (which he called TRW-S) of such a
scheme in the MAP case. This implementation may
only be applied if the trees are monotonic chains, defined as follows: given an ordering of the nodes in a
graph, a set of chains is monotonic if the order of nodes
in the chain respects the given ordering. This structure
allows one to reuse messages in a way that simultaneously implements operations on multiple trees. The
scheduling of messages is important for guaranteeing
convergence in this case. It turns out that one needs to
scan nodes along the pre-specified order, first forward
and then backward.
In the marginals case, the TRW algorithm of Wainwright [12] corresponds to optimizing over tree regions
but is not provably convergent. In the next section we
show how to derive a convergent algorithm for this case
using our formalism.

are two chains, which are also monotonic chains since
they agree with the node ordering {1, 2, 3, 4}. TRW-S
may be viewed as a TCBO algorithm on the subgraph
shown in the blue dashed line (and an additional subgraph corresponding to a pairwise component and all
the chains that contain it).
since it is an instance of a TCBO algorithm for the
sum case. Furthermore, this TRW-S variant differs
from the algorithm in [12] only in the scheduling of
messages.
An additional algorithm that can be easily shown to
be convergent is two way GBP [14] with all double
counting numbers cα = 1, both in the sum and in
the max versions. At each iteration, two-way GBP
updates only the beliefs of a region and one of its subregions, which is trivially a tree. The fact that it maintains reparameterization and enforces consistency can
be shown directly. In fact, it can be shown that two
way GBP with cα = 1 is identical to MSD.

New bound minimizing algorithms
6

By replacing the max with a sum (or vice versa) in
the algorithms discussed in the previous section, we
obtain algorithms that enforce a different type of consistency, and keep the same reparameterization and
region graph as shown in the figures. Thus, the maxproduct version of Heskes’ algorithm and the sumproduct versions of TRW-S, MPLP and MSD are convergent with respect to the relevant bound.
The TRW-S sum-product case is especially interesting. In this case the relevant bound becomes the treereweighted log-partition function bound introduced in
[12]. The message passing algorithm suggested in [12]
does not generally converge. In contrast, the TRWS sum-product algorithm is guaranteed to converge,

Experiments

We present two experiments to illustrate the convergence of our sum and max algorithms. All algorithms
were applied to an instance of a 10x10 “spin glass”
with pairwise terms drawn randomly from [−9, 9] and
field from [−1, 1]. In each case we tested the new
TCBO algorithms.
For estimating the log-partition, we ran TRW and considered a uniform distribution over 2 spanning forests
in the graph: all horizontal and all vertical chains.
These chains are monotone with respect to the node
ordering {1, 2, ..., 100}. We ran TRW-S by following
the nodes order first forward and then backward, updating each time only the messages in the direction of

manner, and all outgoing messages are updated from

For the MAP case, we ran the max-product version of
Heskes’ algorithm using a region graph of pairs (with
double counting numbers 1) and singletons (with double counting numbers 0). We also ran MPLP and MSD
on the same problem. Fig. 7 shows the bounds obtained after each iteration. As can be seen, all three
algorithms monotonically converged to the same value.

Discussion

Despite the empirical success of max-product and sumproduct algorithms in applications, the original algorithms are not guaranteed to converge. Much research
in recent years has therefore been devoted to devising convergent algorithms. Typically these recent algorithms are either max-product or sum-product and
their proof of convergence is specific to the algorithm.
Here we have presented a unified framework for convergent message passing algorithms and showed the importance of enforcing consistency in both sum-product
and max-product algorithms. Not only does this analogy allow us to give a unified derivation for existing
algorithms, it also gives an easy way to derive novel algorithms from existing ones by exchanging maximizations and summations.
Although many convergent algorithms are instances
of our framework, it is worth pointing out two convergent algorithms that are not. The first is Hazan and
Shashua’s recent algorithm [3, 4] which works for provably convex double counting numbers (not necessarily

and TRW-S with edge probability appearances of 1/2.
Note that the two algorithms differ only in the order
of updates they perform. TRW-S follows the node ordering {1, 2, ..., 100} that agrees with the monotonic
chains, first forward and then backward. In the TRW
implementation we followed the same nodes order in a
forward manner.

positive as we are assuming). The second is ordinary
BP on a single cycle, which can be shown to be convergent in both its sum and max product forms. We
emphasize that even negative counting numbers can be
handled by us in some cases, by using larger regions.
All the algorithms we discussed here in fact only updated star graphs in the region graph. Our conditions
for monotonicity apply to general tree updates. However, it seems less straightforward to obtain general
(non-star) tree updates that achieve (max or sum) consistency and reparameterization simultaneously. Interestingly, the tree based updates in [9] do monotonically
decrease an upper bound but seem not to satisfy maxconsistency. Thus, it remains an interesting challenge
to find general tree updates that satisfy the consistency
constraints, as these could be easily used interchangeably for MAP and marginals.
Perhaps the most intriguing result of our analysis is
the importance of update schedule for obtaining convergence – a non-convergent algorithm becomes convergent when the right update schedule is used. It
will be interesting to see whether convergent update
schedules can be derived for an even larger class of
message-passing algorithms.

Appendix A

MPLP as a TCBO
algorithm

MPLP can be derived as an instance of the maxproduct version to Heskes’ algorithm, and thus to be
shown as a TCBO. We derive it for the case where the
potentials in the original graph are defined for pairs,
and then the generalization to larger cliques is simple.
We consider the max-product version to Heskes’ algorithm, applied to the region graph in Fig. 4. The
region graph consists on a layer of all the stars Si
in the original graph. Each star Si corresponds to
a node i and all its neighbours in the original graph,
with the edges between them. The layer of intersection
regions would be all the edges < ij >. The counting numbers would be cSi = 1 for a star region and
cij = 0 for an edge region. Assuming that the original potentials are θij (xi , xj ) for all pairs, we define the
new potentials to be θ̃(xi , xj ) = 0 for the subsets, and
P
θ̃(xSi ) = 21 j∈N i θij (xi , xj ) for the stars.
The messages passed in MPLP mij→i (xi ) are obtained
from the messages µij→Si (xi , xj ) passed in Heskes’ algorithm through the transformation:

mtij→i (xi ) = max
θij (xi , xj ) + µtij→Si (xi , xj )

It is easy to verify that this transformation yields the
same update rule and beliefs of MPLP, and the same
bound is minimized.
In order to generalize our derivation for clusters larger
than pairs, we should replace the edges and stars by
