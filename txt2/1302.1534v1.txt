Depending on the variable order­

leads to different performance guarantees.
When a problem has a large induced width bucket­
elimination is unsuitable because of its extensive
memory demand. Approximation algorithms should
be attempted instead. We present here a collection

work (BN) is a pair (G, P) where G is a directed
acyclic graph and P = {P;}. P; = {P(X,Ipa(X,))}

with X,. An a11signment (X1 = :llt, .. .,Xn = :!ln }

over a sub11et S. if u is a tuple over a &ubset X,
then us denotes that assignment, which is restricted
to the variables in S n X. An evidence set e is an
instantiated subset of variables. We use (us, :cp) to
denote the tuple us appended by a value :z:P of Xp,
where Xp is not in S. We define i, = (:c1,...,z,)
and i{ = (z;,:z:i+l• ... , Zj).

to the arity of the functions being recorded, we pro­
pose to approximate these functions by a collection

of applying the elimination operator (i.e., multiplica­

tion above, it can be applied to a more coerced par­

Cases of completeness

Clearly, approz-mpe(n, n) is identical to elim-mpe
because a full bucket is always a refinement-maximal
(n, n)-partitioning. There are additional cases for i
and m where the two algorithms coincide, and in
such cases approz-mpe(i, m} is complete. One case
is when the ordering d used by the algorithm has
induced width less than i. Formally,
Theorem 3. 7

Algorithm appro:z:.mpe(i, n} i! com­
plete for ordered network! having w• (d) � i.

Another interesting case is when m = 1. Algo­
rithm approz-mpe(n, 1) under some minor modifica­
tions and if applied to a poly-tree along some legal
orderings coincides with Pearl's poly-tree algorithm
[11]. A legal ordering of a poly-tree is one in which
observed variables appear last in the ordering and
otherwise, each child node appears before its par­
ents, and all the parents of the same family are con­
secutive.
Algorithm approz-mpe{n, 1} will solve
the mpe task on poly-trees with a legal variable­
ordering in time and space O(ezp(IFI)), where IFI
is the cardinality of the maximum family size. In
other words, it is complete for poly-trees and, like
Pearl's algorithm, it is tractable. Note, however,
that Pearl's algorithm records only unary functions
on a single variable, while ours records intermediate
results whose arity is at most the size of the fam­
ily. To restrict space needs, we modify elim-mpe
and approz-mpe{i, m} as follows. Whenever the al­
gorithm reaches a set of consecutive buckets from the
same family, all such buckets are combined into one
!uper-bucket indexed by a.ll the constituent buckets'
variables. In summary,

in variable X1, namely, to compute P(:z: 1, e) =
L-z=:!;" II�1P(:z:i, e[:z:pa.).
When processing each
bucket, we multiply all the bucket's matrices,
At. ... , >..i> defined over subsets S1, ... , S;, and then
eliminate the bucket's variable by summation [3].
In [4] we presented the mini-bucket approximation
scheme for belief updating. For completeness, we
summarize this scheme next. Let Ql = {Q1, , Q,.}
be a partitioning into mini-buckets of the func­
tions >.1, ... , >.; in Xp 's bucket. Algorithm elim­
bel com.putes )..P: (l index the mini-buckets) )..P =
Lx, II�=l >..i = l:x, III=1 lit, >..1,. Separating the
processing of one mini-bucket (call it first) from
the rest, we get ).P
L:x, (ITt, >.1,) (W==ziTt,>.t.),
and migrating the summation into each mini-bucket
yields, �, = rrr=l Lx, rr,,>..l,. This, however,
amounts to computing an unnecessarily bad upper
bound on P because the product IIt,>..l, for i > 1
is bounded by .L:x, II,,>.,,. Instead of bounding a
function of X by 1ts sum over X, we can bound
by its maximizing function, which yields �' =
.L:x,.((Iltl>.h) rrr=2ma:z:x,.III,AI.;)· Clearly, for ev­
ery partitioning Q, )..P::; yq · In summary, an upper
bound gP of )..P can be obtamed by processing one of
Xp 's mini� buckets by summation, and then process­
ing the rest of Xp's mini-buckets by maximization.
In addition to approximating by an upper bound, we
can approximate by a lower bound by applying the
min operator to each mini-bucket or by computing
a mean-value approximation using the mean-value
operator in each mini-bucket. Algorithm, appro:c­
bel-maz(i, m) , that uses the maximizing elimination
operator is described in [4]. In analogy to the mpe
task, we can conclude that, approz-bel-ma:c(i,m} has
time complexity O(m · ezp(2i)), is complete when,
(1) w"(d) � i, and, (2) when m = 1 and i = n, if

Consider a belief network appropriate for decoding
a multiple turbo-code, that has M code fragments
(see Figure 5, which is taken from Figure 9 in [2]).
In this example, the Ufs are the information bits, the
X;'s are the code fragments, and the Yi's and Y,,'s
are the output of the channel. The task is to assess
the most likely values for the U's given the observed
Y's. Here, the X's are summation variables, while
the U's are maximization variables. After the ob­
servation's buckets are processed, (lower case char­

first three buckets by summation and the rest by
maximization using appro:c-map(n, 1}, we get that

From these runs we observe a considerable efficiency
gain (2-3 orders of magnitude) relative to elim-mpe
for 50% of the probelm instances for which the ac­
curacy factor obtained was bounded by 4. We also
observe that, as expected, sparser networks require
lower levels of approximations than those required
by dense networks, in order to get similar levels of
accuracy. In particular, the performance of appro:tJ­
mpe(i=a) gave a 1-2 orders of magnitude perfor­
mance speedup while accompanied with an accuracy
factor bounde by 4, to 80 percent of the instances on
dense networks, and to 97 percent of the sparse net­
works. From table 1 we also observe that controlling
the approximation by i provides a better handle on
accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff. Finally, we observe
that approz-mpe(m=l} can be quite bad for arbi­
trary networks.
We experimented next with larger networks (sets
3 and 4), on which running the complete elimina­
tion algorithm was sometimes computationally pro­
hibitive. The results are reported in Tables 4 and
5. Since we did not run the complete algorithm on
those networks, we report the ratio U/L. We see that
the approximation is still effective (a factor of accu­
racy bounded by 10 achieved very effectively) for
sparse networks (set 3). However, on set 4, appro:tJ-

mpe(m} was too expensive to run for m = 3, 4, and
too inaccurate for m = 1, 2. For this difficult class,
an acceptable accuracy was not obtained.
6.1.2

Noisy-OR networks

We experimented with several sets of random noisy­
OR networks and we report on three sets with 30
variables and 100 edges.
The results are summa­
rized in Figure 6 and Table 6. In the first, we display
all instances of set 5 plating the accuracy (M/L and
U /M) vs T R, for all 90 instances. In the second
we display the results on sets 6 and 7 in a manner
similar to Table 2. T.,1 gives the time of elim-mpe.
The results for the noisy-OR networks are much
more impressive than for the uniform random net­
works. The approximation algorithms often get a
correct mpe while still accompanied by 1-2 orders of
magnitue of speed-up (see cases when i = 12 and
i = 15.) Although the mean values of U /M and
M/1 can be large on average due to rare instances
(see Figure 6), in many of the cases both ratios are
close or equal to 1.
In summary, for random uniform and noisy-OR net­
works, 1. we observe that very efficient approxi­
mation algorithms can obtain good accuracy for a
considerable number of instances, 2. appro:tJ-mpe(i)
allows a more gradual control of the accuracy vs. ef-

and positive results.

On the negative side, we see

that when the approximation algorithm coincides
with Pearl's poly-tree propagation algorithm (i.e.,
when we use

approz-mpe(m=l}) ,

it can produce ar­

bitrarily bad results, which contrasts recent suc­
cesses with Pearl's poly-tree algorithm when ap­
plied to examples coming from coding problems

9].

[2;

On the positive side, we see that on many prob­

lem instances the approximations can be quite good.
As theory dictates, we observe substantial improve­
ments in approximation quality as we increase the
parameters

(m

or

i).

This allows the user to an­

alyze in advance, based on memory considerations
and given the problem's graph, what would be the
best

m and i he can effort to use.

upper and lower bounds approximations can be de­
rived for sigmoid belief networks. Specifically, each
Sigmoid function in a bucket, is approximated by a
Gaussian function.

curacy of the result can be evaluated by comparing
the lower and upper bounds generated. The poten­
tial of this approach for heuristic guidance in search,
still needs to be tested.
The mini-bucket approximations parallel consis­
tency enforcing algorithms for constraint pro­
cessing, in particular those enforcing directional
consistency [5].
Specifically, algorithms such
as adaptive-consistency or adaptive-relational con­
sistency are full bucket-elimination algorithms
[7]. Their approximation algorithm, directional­
relational-consistency(i, m) [7], enforces bounded
levels of directional consistency.
In propo­
sitional satisfiability, bounded-directional-resolution
with bound b corresponds to the mini-bucket algo­
rithm with i = b [6] . Recently, a collection of approx­
imation algorithms for sigmoid belief networks was
presented in the context of a recursive algorithm sim­
ilar to bucket elimination [8] . It is shown [8] that an
