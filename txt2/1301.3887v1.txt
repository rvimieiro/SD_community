as a model for decision-theoretic planning. Their general­
ity allows one to seamlessly model sensor and action uncer­
tainty, uncertainty in the state of knowledge, and multiple
objectives [ 1 , 4]. Despite their attractiveness as a concep­
tual model, POMDPs are intractable and have found prac­
tical applicability in only limited special cases.
Much research in AI has been directed at exploiting cer­
tain types of problem structure to enable value functions for
POMDPs to be computed more effectively. These primar­
ily consist of methods that use the basic, explicit state-based
representation of planning problems [5]. There has, how­
ever, been work on the use of factored representations that
resemble classical AI representations, and algorithms for
solving POMDPs that exploit this structure [2, 8]. Repre­
sentations such as dynamic Bayes nets (DBNs) [7] are used
to represent actions and structured representations of value
functions are produced. Such models are important because

they allow one to deal (potentially) with problems involving
a large number of states (exponential in the number of vari­
ables) without explicitly manipulating states, instead rea­
soning directly with the factored representation.
Unfortunately, such representations do not automatically
translate into effective policy implementation: given a
POMDP value function, one must still maintain a belief
state (or distribution over system states) online in order to
implement the policy implicit in the value function. Belief
state maintenance, in the worst case, has complexity equal
to the size of the state space (exponential in the number of
variables), as well. This is typically the case even when
the system dynamics can be represented compactly using a
DBN, as demonstrated convincingly by Boyen and Koller
[3]. Because of this, Boyen and Koller develop an approx­
imation scheme for monitoring dynamical systems (as op­
posed to POMDP policy implementation); intuitively, they
show that one can decompose a process along lines sug­
gested by the DBN representation and maintain bounded er­
ror in the estimated belief state. Specifically, they approx­
imate the belief state by projection, breaking the joint dis­
tribution into smaller pieces by marginalization over sub­
sets of variables, effectively discounting certain dependen­
cies among variables.
In this paper, we consider approximate belief state moni­
toring for POMDPs. We assume that a POMDP has been
solved and that a value function has been provided to us in
a factored form (as we explain below). Our goal is to de­
termine a projection scheme, or decomposition, so that ap­
proximating the belief state using this scheme hinders the
ability to implement the optimal policy as little as possible.
Our scheme will be quite different from Boyen and Koller's
since our aim is not to keep the approximate belief state
as "close" to the true belief state as possible (as measured
by KL-divergence). Rather we want to ensure that decision
quality is sacrificed as little as possible.
In many circumstances, this means that small correlations
need to be accounted for, while large correlations can be
ignored completely. As an example, one might imagine a
process in which two parts are stamped from the same ma­
chine. If the machine has a certain fault, both parts have
a high probability of being faulty. Yet if the decisions for
subsequent processing of the parts are independent, the fact

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

498

that the fault probabilities for the parts are dependent is ir­
relevant. We can thus project our belief state into two inde­
pendent subprocesses with no loss in decision quality. As­
suming the faults are independent causes a large "error" in
the belief state; but this has no impact on subsequent deci­
sions or even expected utility assessment. Thus we need not
concern ourselves with this "error." In contrast, very small
dependencies, when marginalized, may lead to very small
"error" in the belief state; yet this small error can have se­
vere consequences on decision quality.
Because of this, while Boyen and Koller's notion of pro­
jection offers a very useful tool for belief state approxima­
tion, the model and analysis they provide cannot be applied
usefully to POMDPs. For example, in [ 1 4] this model is
integrated with a (sampling-based) search tree approach to
solving POMDPs. Because the error in decision quality is
determined as a function of the worst-case decision quality
with respect to actual belief state approximation error, the
bounds are unlikely to be useful in practice. We strongly
believe estimates of decision quality error should be based
on direct information about the value function.
In this paper we provide a theoretical framework for the
analysis of value-directed belief state approximation (VDA)
in POMDPs. The framework provides a novel view of ap­
proximation and the errors it induces in decision quality.
We use the value function itself to determine which cor­
relations can be "safely" ignored when monitoring one's
belief state. Our framework offers methods for bounding
(reasonably tightly) the error associated with a given pro­
jection scheme. W hile these methods are computationally
intensive-requiring in the worst case a quadratic increase
in the solution time of a POMDP-we argue that this of­
fline effort is worthwhile to enable fast online implemen­
tation of a policy with bounded loss in decision quality.
We also suggest a heuristic method for choosing good pro­
jection schemes given the value function associated with a
POMDP. Finally, we discuss how our techniques can also
be applied to approximation methods other than projection
(e.g., aggregation using density trees [ 1 3]).

POMDPs and Belief State Monitoring
Solving POMDPs

A partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
is a general model for decision making under uncertainty.
Formally, we require the following components: a finite
state spaceS; a finite action space A; a finite observation
space Z; a transition function T : S x A -+ �(S); an
observation function 0 : S x A -+ �(Z); and a reward
function R : S -+ R.1 Intuitively, the transition function
T(s, a) determines a distribution over next states when an
agent takes action a in states-we write Pr(s, a, t) to de­
note the probability that state t is reached. This captures un­
certainty in action effects. The observation function reflects
the fact that an agent cannot generally determine the true
system state with certainty (e.g., due to sensor noise)-we
write Pr(s, a, z) to denote the probability that observation z

16-(X) denotes the set of distributions over finite set X.

is made at state s when action a is performed. Finally R(s)
denotes the immediate reward associated with s.2
The rewards obtained over time by an agent adopting a spe­
cific course of action can be viewed as random variables
R(t) . Our aim is to construct apolicythat maximizes the ex­
pected sum of discounted rewards E CL�o ··/ R( t)) (where
'Y is a discount factor less than one). It is well-known that
an optimal course of action can be determined by consid­
ering the fully-observable belief state MDP, where belief
states (distributions overS) form states, and a policy rr :
�(S) -+ A maps belief states into action choices. In prin­
ciple, dynamic programming algorithms for MDPs can be
used to solve this problem; but a practical difficulty emerges
when one considers that the belief space �(S) is an S
I I-1dimensional continuous space. A key result of Sondik [ I7]
showed that the value function V for a finite-horizon prob­
lem is piecewise-linear and convex and can be represented
as a finite collection of a-vectors.3 Specifically, one can
generate a collection N of a-vectors, each of dimension S
l I,
such that V(b) = ma:xaEN ba. Figure I illustrates a collec­
tion of a-vectors with the upper surface corresponding to
V. Furthermore, each a E N has a specific action associ­
ated with it; so given belief state b, the agent should choose
the action associated with the maximizing a-vector.
Insight into the nature of POMDP value functions, which
will prove critical in the methods we consider in the
next section, can be gained by examining Monahan's [15]
method for solving POMDPs. Monahan's algorithm pro­
ceeds by producing a sequence of k-stage-to-go value func­
tions Vk, each represented by a set of a-vectors Nk. Each
a E Nk denotes the value (as a function of the belief state)
of executing a k-step conditional plan. More precisely, let
the k-step observation strategies be the set oS< of map­
pings u : Z -+ Nk-l. Then each a-vector in Nk corre­
sponds to the value of executing some action a followed by
implementing some u E OSk; that is, it is the value of do­
ing a, and executing the k- 1-step plan associated with the
a-vector u(z) if z is observed. Using CP(a) to denote this
plan, we have that CP(a) = (a; ifz;, CP(u(z;))'v'z;). We
informally write this as (a; u). We write a( (a; u)) to de­
note the a-vector reflecting the value of this plan.
Given Nk, Nk+l is produced in two phases. First, the set
of vectors corresponding to all action-observation policies
2 Action

costs are ignored to keep the presentation simple.
3For infinite-horizon problems, a finite collection may not be
sufficient [1 8], but will generally offer a good approximation.

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

is constructed (i.e., for each a E A and (J' E osk+l, the
vector a denoting the value of plan (a, CP((J'(z;) ) ) is added
to �k+l ). Second, this set is pruned by removing all domi­
nated vectors. This means that those vectors a such that b·a
is not maximal for any belief state b are removed from �k + 1.
In Figure 1 , a4 is dominated, playing no useful role in the
representation of V, and can be pruned. Pruning is imple­
mented by a series of linear programs. Refinements of this
approach are possible that eliminate (or reduce) the need for
pruning by directly identifying only a-vectors that are non­
dominated [17, 6, 4]. Other algorithms, such as incremen­
tal pruning [5], are similar in spirit to Monahan's approach,
but cleverly avoid enumerating all observation policies. A
finite k-stage POMDP can be solved optimally this way and
a finite representation of its value function is assured. For
infinite-horizon problems, a k-stage solution can be used to
approximate the true value function (error bounds can eas­
ily be derived based on the differences between successive
value functions).
One difficulty with these classical approaches is the fact
that the a-vectors may be difficult to manipulate. A sys­
tem characterized by n random variables has a state space
size that is exponential in n. Thus manipulating a single
a-vector may be intractable for complex systems.4 Fortu­
nately, it is often the case that an MDP or POMDP can be
specified very compactly by exploiting structure (such as
conditional independence among variables) in the system
dynamics and reward function [ 1 ]. Representations such as
dynamic Bayes nets (DBNs) [7 ] can be used to great effect;
and schemes have been proposed whereby the a-vectors are
computed directly in a factored form by exploiting this rep­
resentation.
Boutilier and Poole [2], for example, represent a-vectors
as decision trees in implementing Monahan's algorithm.
Hansen and Feng [8] use algebraic decision diagrams
(ADDs) as their representation in their version of incre­
mental pruning.5 The empirical results in [8] suggest that
such methods can make reasonably large problems solv­
able. Furthermore, factored representations will likely fa­
cilitate good approximation schemes. There is no reason
in principle that the other algorithms mentioned cannot be
adapted to factored representations as well.

2.2

Belief State Monitoring

Even if the value function can be constructed in a compact
way, the implementation of the optimal policy requires that
the agent maintains its belief state over time. The monitor­
ing problem itself is not generally tractable, since each be­
lief state is a vector of size jSj. Given a compact represen­
tation of system dynamics and sensors in the form of DBN,
one might expect that monitoring may become tractable us­
ing standard belief net inference schemes. Unfortunately,
this is generally not the case. Though variables may be ini4
The number of a-vectors can grow exponentially in the worst
case, as well; but for many problems the number remains manage­
able; and approximation schemes that simply bound their number
have been proposed [6].
5 ADDs, commonly used in verification, have been applied
very effectively to the solution of fully-observable MDPs [9].

tially independent (thus admitting a compact representation
of a distribution), and though at each time step only a small
number of variables become correlated, over time these cor­
relations "bleed through" the DBN, rendering most (if not
all) variables dependent after a time. Thus compact repre­
sentation of belief state is typically impossible.
Boyen and Koller [3] have devised a clever approximation
scheme for alleviating the computational burden of moni­
toring. In this work, no POMDP is used, but rather a sta­
tionary process, represented in a factored manner (e.g., us­
ing a DBN), is assumed. This might, for example, be the
process induced by adopting a fixed policy. Intuitively, they
consider projection schemes whereby the joint distribution
is approximated by projecting it onto a set of subsets of vari­
ables. It is assumed that these subsets partition the variable
set. For each subset, its marginal is computed; the approx­
imate belief state is formed by assuming the subsets are in­
dependent. Thus only variables within the same subset can
remain correlated in the approximate belief state. For in­
stance, if there are 4 variables A, B, C and D, the projection
scheme { AB, CD} will compute the marginal distributions
for AB and CD. The resulting approximate belief state,
P(ABCD) = P(AB)P(CD), has a compact, factored
representation given by the distribution of each marginal.
Formally, we say a projection scheme S is a set of subsets
of the set of state variables such that each state variable is in
some subset. This allows marginals with overlapping sub­
sets of variables (e.g., {ABC, BCD}). We view strict par­
titioning as a special type of projection. Some schemes with
overlapping subsets may not be computationally useful in
practice because it may not be possible to easily generate a
joint distribution from them by building a clique tree. We
therefore classify as practical those projection schemes for
which a joint distribution is easily obtained. Assuming that
belief state monitoring is performed using the DBN repre­
senting the system dynamics (see [ 1 0, 1 2] for details on in­
ference with DBNs), we obtain belief state bt+l from bt us­
ing the following steps: (a) construct a clique tree encod­
ing the variable dependencies of the system dynamics (for
a specific action and observation) and the correlations that
have been preserved by the marginals representing bt; (b)
initialize the clique tree with the transition probabilities, the
observation probabilities and the (approximate, factored)
joint distribution bt; (c) query the tree to obtain the distribu­
tion b� at the next time step; and (d) project b� according
to some practical projection scheme S to obtain the collec­
tion of marginals representing bt+l = S(b�) . The com­
plexity of belief state updating is now exponential only in
the size of the largest clique rather than the total number of
variables.
Boyen and Koller show how to compute a bound on the
KL-divergence of the true and approximate belief states,
exploiting the contraction properties of Markov processes
(under certain assumptions). But direct translation of these
bounds into decision quality error for POMDPs generally
yields weak bounds [ 1 4] . Furthermore, the suggestions
made by Boyen and Koller for choosing good projection
schemes are designed to minimize KL-divergence, not to
minimize error in expected value for a POMDP. For this rea-

tions that are directly influenced by considerations of value
and decision quality.
Other belief state approximation schemes can be used for
belief state monitoring. For example, aggregation using
density trees can provide a means of representing a belief
state with many fewer parameters than the full joint. Our
model can be applied to such schemes as well.

with b, b and S(b) are a1,a2 and aa,respectively (see Fig­
ure 2). The approximation at stagek mistakenly induces the
choice of the action associated with a3 instead of a2 at b;
this incurs an error in decision quality of b · a2 - b · aa.
While the optimal choice is in fact a1, the unaccounted er­
ror b · a1 - b · a2 induced by the prior approximations will
be viewed as caused by the earlier approximations; our goal
at this point is simply to consider the error induced by the
current approximation.
In order to derive an error bound,we must identify,for each
a E �k,the set of vectors Swk(a) that the agent can switch
to by approximating its current belief state b given that b
identifies a as optimal. Formally,we define

Error Bounds on Approximation Schemes

In this section, we assume that a POMDP has been solved
and that its value function has been provided to us. We
also assume that some structured technique has been used
so that a-vectors representing the value function are struc­
tured [2, 8]. We begin by assuming that we have been given
an approximation scheme S for belief state monitoring in
a POMDP and derive error bounds associated with acting
according to that approximation scheme. We focus primar­
ily on projection, but we will mention how other types of
approximation can be fit into our model. We present two
techniques for bounding the error for a given approximation
scheme and show that the complexity of these algorithms is
similar to that of solving the POMDP, with a (multiplica­
tive) overhead factor of 1 �13.1

Plan Switching

Implementing the policy for an infinite-horizonPOMDP re­
quires that one maintains a belief state, plugging this into
the value function at each step,and executing the action as­
sociated with the maximizing a-vector. When the belief
state b is approximated using an approximation scheme S,
a suboptimal policy may be implemented since the maxi­
mizing vector for S(b) will be chosen rather than the max­
imizing vector for b. Furthermore this mistaken choice of
vectors (hence actions) can be compounded with each fur­
ther approximation at later stages of the process. To bound
such error, we first define the notion of plan switching. We
phrase our definitions in terms of finite-horizon value func­
tions,introducing the minor variations needed for infinite­
horizon problems later.
Suppose withk stages-to-go, the true belief state, had we
monitored accurately to that point, is b. However, due to
previous belief state approximations we take our current be­
lief state to be b. Now imagine our approximation scheme
has been ap�lied at timek to obtain S(b). Given �k, rep­
resenting V , suppose the maximizing vectors associated

Swk(a) = {a' E �k :3b'v'a(b·a 2: b·a,S(b)·a' 2: S(b)·a)}
Intuitively,this is the set of vectors we could choose as max­
imizing (thus implementing the corresponding conditional
plan) due to belief state approximation. In Figure 3, we see
that Swk(aa) = {a1, a2, a4}. The set Swk(a;) can be
identified readily by solving a series of O(l�k I) optimiza­
tion problems,each testing the possibility of switching to a
specific vector aj E �k, formulated as the following (pos­
sibly nonlinear) program:
max

s. t.

d
b . (a; - at) 2: d
'v'l -::j:: i
S(b) · (ai- at) 2: d 'v'l -::j:: j
Ls b(s) = 1
'v's
b(s) 2: 0

The solution to this program has a positive objective func­
tion value whenever there is a belief state b such that a; is
optimal at b, and aj is optimal at S(b). Note, in fact, that
we need only find a positive feasible solution,not an opti­
mal one, to identify aj as an element of Swk(a;). There
are I �k I switch sets to construct,so 0 (I �k12) optimization
problems need to be solved to determine all switch sets.
For linear approximation schemes (i.e., those in which the
constraints on S(b) are linear in the variables b; ), these
problems are easily solvable linear programs (LPs). We re­
turn to linear schemes in Section 6. Unfortunately,projec­
tion schemes are nonlinear, making optimization (or iden­
tification of feasible solutions) more difficult. On the other
hand, a projection scheme determines a set of linear con­
straints on the approximate belief state S(b). For instance,
consider the projection scheme S
{CD,DE} for

501

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

a POMDP with 3 binary variables. This projection im­
poses one linear constraint on S(b) for each subset of the
marginals in the projection:6

b(C)
b' (0)
b(E)
b'(D)
b'(CD) b(DE)

b(0)
b(D)
b(CD)

b'(C)
b'(E)
b'(DE)

Here b' denotes S(b) and b(XY) denotes the cumulative
probability (according to belief state b) of all states where
X and Y are true. These constraints define an LP that can
be used to construct a superset Swk(a;) of Swk(a;). Given
scheme S = {M1 , ... , Mn}, we define the following LP:
max d

s.t.

b ·(a; - at) 2': d
b' (aj- at) 2': d
b'(M) = b(M)
Ls b(s) = 1
Vs
b(s) 2': 0
Vs
b' (s) 2': 0
·

When a feasible positive solution exists,aj is added to the
set Swk(a;), though in fact, it may not properly be a member of Swk(a;). If no positive solution exists,we know a j
is not in Swk(a;) and it is not added to Swk(a;). This superset of the switch set can be used to derive an upper bound
on error.
While the number of constraints of the type b(M) = b' (M)
is exponential in the size of the largest marginal,we expect
that the number of variables in each marginal for a useful
projection scheme will be bounded by a small constant. In
this way, the number of constraints can be viewed as con­
stant (i.e., independent of state space size).
Though the above LPs (for both linear approximations and
projection schemes) look complex, they are in fact very
similar in size to the LPs used for dominance testing in
Monahan's pruning algorithm and the Witness algorithm,
involving O(ISI) variables and O(INkI) constraints. The
number of LP variables is exponential in the number of state
variables; however,the factored representation of a-vectors
allows LPs to be structured in such a way that the state
space need not be enumerated (i.e.,the variables represent­
ing the state probabilities can be clustered). Precisely the
same structuring is suggested in [2] and implemented in [8].
Thus solving an LP to test if the agent can switch from a; to
aj has the same complexity as a dominance test in the prun­
2
ing phase ofPOMDP solving. However,there are O(INk 1 )
pairs of a-vectors to test for plan switching whereas the
pruning phase may require as few as INkI dominance tests
if no vector is pruned. Hence, in the worst case, switch set
generation may increase the running time for solving the
POMDP by a factor of 0(INkI) at each stagek.
For ak-stage, finite-horizon POMDP, we can now bound
the error in decision quality due to approximationS. Define
the bound on the maximum error introduced at each stage j,
6
These equations can be generalized for POMDPs with non­
binary variables, though giving more than one equation per subset.

when a is viewed as optimal,as: 7

B1(a) = max
b

max b ·(a - a')
-J
a'ESW (a)

Since error at a belief state is simply the expectation of
the error at its component states, B1(a) can be determined
by comparing the vectors in S.Vj(a) with a component­

wise (with the maximum difference being B1(a)). L et
B1 = maxaENi B1(a) be the greatest error introduced
by a single approximation S at stage j . Then the total er­
ror fork successive approximations is bounded by ug =
2::::7=1 /i B1. For an infinite-horizon POMDP, assume we
have been given the infinite-horizon value function N* (i.e. ,
no stages are involved). Then we only need to compute
the switch sets Sw*(a) for this single N-set, and the max­
imum one-shot switching error B'S. The upper bound on
the loss incurred by applying s indefinitely is simply u; =
B'S /(1 - !). Computing the error u; is roughly equivalent
to performing 0( IN* I) dynamic programming backups on
N*.
The LP formulation used to construct switch sets is com­
putationally intensive. Other methods can be used how­
ever to construct these switch sets. We have, for example,
implemented a scheme whereby belief states are treated as
vectors in 3{181, and projection schemes are viewed as dis­
placing these vectors. The displacement vectors (vectors
which when added to a belief state b giveS(b)) induced by a
scheme S can be computed easily and can be used to deter­
mine the direction in which belief state approximation shifts
the true belief state. This is tum can be used to construct
overestimates of switch sets. While giving rise to looser er­
ror bounds, this method is much more efficient in practice.
Our emphasis, however, is on the analysis of error due to
approximation, so we do not dwell on this scheme in this
paper (see [ 16] for details).
3.2

Alternative Plans

The cumulative error induced by switching plans at cur­
rent and future stages can be bounded in a tighter way. The
idea is to generate the set of alternative plans that may be
executed as a result of both current and future approxima­
tions. Suppose that an agent,due to approximation at stage
k changes its belief state from b to S(b). This can induce
a change in the choice of optimal a-vector in Nk,say from
a1 to a2. However,even though the agent has switched and
chosen the first action associated with a2, it has not nec­
essarily committed to implementing the entire conditional
plan CP( a2) associated with a2. This is because further ap­
proximation at stagek - 1 may cause it to switch from the
continuation of CP( a2).
Suppose for instance that CP(a2) = (a;(]"), where (j ( z ) =
a3 E Nk-1. If z is observed,and the agent updates its (ap­
proximate) belief state S(b) accurately to obtain S(b)',then
7We use 'S;;,j instead of Sw' to emphasize the fact that we
use the approximate switch set generated for a projection scheme;
however, all definitions apply equally well to exact switch sets if
they are available.

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

502

the maximizing vector at the next stage is necessarily a3.
But given that S(b)' will be approximated before the max­
imizing vector is chosen, the agent may adopt some other
continuation of the plan if a3 does not maximize value for
the (second) approximated belief state S(S(b)'). In fact,
the agent may implement CP(a4) at stage k - 1 for any
a4 ESwk -1 ( a3). Notice that the value of the plan actually
implemented-doing the first action of a2, followed by the
first action of a4, and so on-may not be represented by any
a-vector in �k.
We can actually construct the values of such plans, and thus
obtain much tighter error bounds, while we perform dy­
namic programming. We recursively define the set of al­
ternative sets, orA/t-sets for each vector at each stage.8 We
first define
That is, if a is optimal at stage 1 , then any vector in its
switch set can have its plan executed. The future alterna­
tive set for any a E �k, where CP(a) = (a, a"), is:

FA/t (a)

=

{a ((a, o-')) : ('v'z) o-' (z) EAlt-1 (o- (z))}

If a is in fact chosen to be executed at stagek, true expected
value may in fact be given by any vector in FAit (a), this
is due to future switching of policies at stages followingk.
Finally, define

Alt (a)

=

U{FA!t(a'): a' E Swk (a)}

If a is in fact optimal at stagek for a given belief state b, but
b is approximated currently and at every future stage, then
expected value might be reflected by any vector in Alt (a).
These vectors correspond to every possible course of ac­
tion that could be adopted because of approximation: if we
switch vectors at stage k, we could begin to execute (the
plan associated with) any a' ESwk (a); and if we begin ex­
ecuting a', we could end up executing (the plan associated
with) any a" E FAit (a').
Given these Alt-sets, the error associated with belief state
approximation can be given by the maximum difference in
value between any a and one of itsA/t-vectors. These FAit
and A/t-sets can be computed by dynamic programming
while a POMDP is being solved. The complexity of this al­
gorithm is virtually identical to that of generating �k from
�k-1, with the proviso that there are l�kl Alt-sets. How­
ever, these sets grow exponentially much like the sets �k
would if left unpruned. However, these sets can be pruned
in exactly the same way as �-sets, with the exception that
since we want to produce a worst-case bound on error, we
want to construct a lower surface for theAlt-sets rather than
an upper surface.
Given any Alt-set, we denote by Alt the collection of vectors
that are anti-dominating in Alt. For example, if the collec­
tion of vectors in Figure 4, form the set Alt (a), then the
vectors a1 and a4, making up the lower surface of this set,

This definition can be more concisely specified, but this for­
mat makes the computational implications clear.

formAlt (a). FAit (a) is defined similarly. The set of antidominated vectors can be pruned in exactly the same way
that dominated a-vectors are pruned from a value function.
The same structuring techniques can be used to prevent ex­
�cit state enumeration as well. This pruning can keep the
AIt-sets very manageable in size. Assuming we have an approximation Altk(a) of Alt (a) for every a E �k, we con­
-k+1
struct Alt (a) as follows: (a) swk+1 (a) is constructed
-k+l
for each a E �k+1; (b) FAit
( a ) is constructed using
-k
Alt (a ) , and is then pruned to retain only anti-dominating
-k+l
vectors; and (c) Alt (a) is defined as the union of the
-k+l
FAit (a') sets for those a' E Swk+1 (a), and is then
pruned.
The following quantity bounds the error associated with ap­
proximating belief state using scheme S over the course of a
k-stage POMDP, when a represents optimal expected value
for the initial belief state:
-k
Ek5 (a) = maxmax{b ·(a - aI ): a' E Alt (a)}
b

This error can be computed using simple pointwise com­
parison of a with each such a'. It can also be restricted to
that region of belief space where a is optimal; maximizing
the difference only over belief states in that area to obtain a
tighter bound. Approximation error can be bounded glob­
ally using

E�

=

max{E�(a) :a E �k}

Furthermore, E� :::; U� since alternate vectors provide a
much tighter way to measure cumulative error.
For an infinite-horizon problem, we can compute switch
sets once as in the computation of Us. To compute a tighter
bound E'5, we can constructk-stages of Azt-sets, backing up
from �·. The bound E� is computed as above, and we set

E'5

=

E� +·-/Us

In this way, we can obtain fairly tight bounds on the error
induced by belief state approximation.

The bounds Bk ( a ) and Ek described above can be used in
several ways to determine a good projection scheme. In or­

projection scheme, our "generic algorithm" will have to de­
termine the error associated with a different projectionS ap­
plied to each a-vector. Because of this, we will consider the
use of dijferent projection schemes So: for each a-vector (at
each stage if we have a finite-horizon problem). D espite �he
fact that we previously derived bounds on error assurrung
a uniform projection scheme, our algorithms work equally
well (i.e., provide legitimate bounds) if different projections
are used with each vector. The projection So: adopted for
vector a simply influences its switch set. Since the agent
knows which vector it is "implementing" at any point in
time we can record and easily apply the projection scheme
So: f�r that vector. This allows the agent to tailor its belief
state approximation to provide good results for its currently
anticipated course of action. This in tum will lead to much
better performance than using a uniform scheme.
4.1

Lattice of Projection Schemes

We can structure the search for a projection scheme by con­
sidering the lattice of projection schemes d�fined by �ub­
set inclusion. Specifically, we say St contams S2 (wntten
loosely S2 � St) if every subset of S2 is contai�ed �ithi�
.
.
some subset of S1. This means that S2 ts a finer parttt10n
than S1. The lattice of projections for three binary variables
is illustrated in Figure 5. Each node represents the set of
marginals defining some projection S. Above each node,
the subsets corresponding to its constraining equations are
listed (we refer to each such subset as a constraint). The
finest projections (which are the "most approximate" si�ce
they assume more independence) are at the top of the latttce.
Edges are labeled with the subset of variables correspond­
ing to the single constraining equation th�t �ust be a?ded
to the parent's constraints to obtain the chtld s constramts.
It should be clear that if S2 � St, then St offers (not neces­
sarily strictly) tighter bounds on error when used instead �f
S2 at any point. To see this, imagine that various arproxt­
mation schemes are used for different a-vectors at dtfferent
stages, and that S2 is used whenever a E Ni is chosen. If
we keep everything fixed but replace S2 with S1 at a, we
first observe that Sw�, (a) � Sw�, (a). This ensures that
B�, (a) :::; Bt (a) and Bt :::; B�, . If all other projection

503

.
operators are the same, then obvwusly
U5k, :::; uks, · s·trru-.
lar remarks apply to the infinite-horizon case. Furthermore,
given the definition of Alt-sets, reducing the switch set for
a at stagek by using S1 instead of S2 ensures that the Alt­
sets at all preceding stages are no larger (and may well be
smaller) than they would be if S2 were used. For this rea­
son, we have that E�, :::; E�, (and similarly E5, :::; E5,).
Consequently, as we move down the lattice, the bound on
approximation error gets smaller (i.e., our approximations
improve, at least in the worst case). Of course, the com­
putational effort of monitoring increases as well. The pre­
cise computational effort of monitoring will depend on the
structure of the D BN for the POMDP dynamics and its in­
teraction with the marginals given by the chosen projec­
tion scheme; however, the complexity of inference (i.e., the
dominant factors in the corresponding clique tree), can be
easily determined for any node in the lattice.
4.2

Search for a Good Projection Scheme

In a POMDP setting, the agent may have a bounded amount
of time to make an online decision at each time-step.
For this reason, efficient belief-state monitoring is crucial.
However, just as solving the POMDP is viewed as an offline
operation, so is the search for a good projection sch�me.
Thus it will generally pay to expend some computattonal
effort to search for a good projection scheme that makes
the appropriate tradeoff between decision quality and the
complexity of belief state maintenance. For instance, if any
scheme S with at most c constraints offers acceptable on­
line performance, then the agent need only search the row of
the lattice containing those projection schemes with c con­
straints. However, the size of this row is factorial in c. So
instead we use the structure of the lattice to direct our atten­
tion toward reasonable projections.
We describe here a generic, greedy, anytime algorithm for
finding a suitable projection scheme. We start with the root,
and evaluate each of its children. The child that looks most
"promising" is chosen as our current projection scheme. Its
children are then evaluated, and so on; this continues un­
til an approximation is found that incurs no err?r (specifi­
cally, each switch set is a singleton, as we descnbe below),
or a bound on the size of the projection is reached. We as­
sume for simplicity that at most c constraints will be al­
lowed. The search proceeds to depth c- n in the lattice and
at each node, at most n ( c - n) children are evaluated, so
a total of 0 ( nc2 - en2 ) nodes are examined. Since c must
be greater than n-the root node itself has n constraints.­
we assume 0 ( nc2 ) complexity. The structure of the lattice
ensures that decision quality (as measured by error bounds)
cannot decrease at any step. We note that practical and non­
practical projections are included in the lattice. In figure 5,
the only non-practical scheme is S = { AB, AC, B<:}.
During the search, it doesn't matter if a node correspondmg
to a non-practical scheme is traversed, as long as the final
node is practical. If it is not practical, then the best pr�c­
tical sibling of that node is picked or we backtrack �nt.tl a
.
practical scheme is found. We also note that smce t�Is �s a
greedy approach, we may not discover the bes� �roJectwn
with a fixed number of constraints. However, tt ts a well-

504

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

structured search space and other search methods for navi­
gating the lattice could be used.
We first describe one instantiation of this algorithm, the
finite-horizon U-bound search, for ak-stage, finite-horizon
POMDP. Given the collections of a-vectors N i, . . . , Nk, we
run the following search independently for each vector a E
N' for each i :::; k. The order does not matter; we will end
up with a projection scheme S for each a-vector, which is
�pplied whenever that a-vector is chosen as optimal at stage
z. We essentially minimize (over S) each term B� (a) in
�he bound Uk independently. For a given vector a at stage
z, the search proceeds from the root in a greedy fashion.
Each �hild S of the current node is evaluated by comput­
ing B5 (a), which basically requires that we compute the
switch set Sw5 (a), which in turn requires the solution of
IN' I LPs. Once the projection schemes Sa for each a are
fo�nd, the error bound Uk is given by the sum of the bounds
B' as described in the previous section. At each stage i,
the number of LPs that must be solved is O(nc2IN; 12) since
there are O(IN' I) a-vectors and for each a-vector, the lattice
search traverses 0 (nc2) nodes, each requiring the solution
of 0( IN' I) LPs. Since the solution of the original POMDP
requires the solution of at least IN I LPs, the overhead in­
curred is at most a factor of nc21N1.
The method above can be streamlined considerably. When
comparing two nodes, it is not always necessary to gener­
ate the entire switch set to determine which node has the
lowest bound W (a). Each vector a' in a's switch set intro­
duces an error of at most maJQ,{b(a- a')}. Since Bi(a) =
maxa'ESw'(a) {ma}Q, b(a - a')}, we can test vectors a'
in decreasing order of contributed error until one vector is
found to be in the switch set at one node but not the other.
The node that does not include this vector in its switch set
�as the lowest bound B� (a) (where S is that node's projec­
twn scheme). Instead of solving IN' I pairs of LPs, generally
only a few pairs of LPs will be solved.
When testing whether two different schemes S1 and S2
allow switching to some a-vector, the LPs to be solved
for each scheme are similar, differing only in the con­
straints dictated by each projection scheme. This similarity
can be exploited computationally by using techniques that
take advantage of the numerous common constraints if we
solv� similar LPs "concurrently" (for instance, by solving
a stnpped down LP that has only the common constraints
and using the dual simplex method to account for the extra
constraints). Though details are beyond the scope of this
paper, these techniques are faster in practice than solving
each LP from scratch. The greedy search can take full ad­
vantage of these speed-ups: each child has only one addi­
tional constraint (compared to its parent), so not only can
structure be shared across children, but the parent's solu­
tion can be exploited as well. We reiterate that these LPs
can also be structured, so state space enumeration is not re­
quired. Taken together, these computational tricks don't re­
duce the worst-case running time of O(nc2 IN I2) LPs; how­
ever in practice it is possible that only D(nciNI) LPs need be
solved, in which case, when integrated with the algorithm to
solve the POMDP, the overhead incurred would be a factor

proportional to nc. A thorough experimentation remains to
be done.
There are three variations of the algorithm above. The
infinite-horizon U-bound algorithm is much like the finite­
horizon version. However, we only have one set of a­
ve�tors, W, rather thank sets. Thus we compute far fewer
switch sets, and calculate the final bound using the equation
for U*. The finite-horizon E-bound algorithm is similar to
the above algorithm as well. The difference is that we compute A/_1-s�ts (or rather approximations to them, Alt5k(a))
to obtam tighter bounds on error. To do this requires that
we compute the projection schemes for the various stages
in order, from the last stage back to the first. Once a good
scheme has been found for the elements of Ni, the OOt-sets
can be computed for stage j + 1 without difficulty (this in­
volves simple DP backups). Then switch sets are computed
exactly as above, from whichAzt-sets, and error bounds, are
generated. Finally, the infinite-horizon E-bound algorithm
�roceeds by computing the switch sets for a given projec­
tion only once for each vector inN*; but additional DP back­
ups to compute Alt-sets (as described in the previous sec­
tion) are needed to derive tight error bounds.

Illustrative Example

We describe a very simple POMDP to illustrate the benefits
of value-directed approximation, with the aim of demon­
strati�g that minimizing belief state error is not always ap­
propnate when approximate monitoring is used to imple­
ment an optimal policy. The process involves only seven
stages with only one or two actions per stage (thus at some
stages no choice needs to be made), and no observations are
involved. Yet even such a simple system shows the benefits
of allowing the value function to influence the choice of ap­
proximation scheme.
We suppose there is a seven-stage manufacturing process
whereby four parts are produced using three machines, M,
Ml, and M2. Parts PI, P2, P3, and P4 are each stamped
in turn by machine M. Once stamped, parts P 1 and P2
are processed separately (in turn) on machine Ml, while
parts P3 and P4 are processed together on M2. Machine
M may be faulty (FM), with prior probability P r(FM).
When the parts are stamped by M, parts P 1 and P2 may be­
come faulty (F 1, F2), with higher probability of fault if FM
hol�s. �arts_P3 and P4 may also become faulty (F3, F4),
agam With higher probability if FM; but F3 and F4 are both
less sensitive to FM than Fl and F2 (e.g., P r(FIIFM) =
P r(F2IFM) > P r (F3IFM) = P r (F4IFM) ). If PI or P2 are
processed on machine M1 when faulty, a cost is incurred;
�f processed when OK, a gain is had; if not processed (re­
Jected), n� cost or gain is had. When P3 and P4 are pro­
.
cessed (jomtly)on M3, a greater gain is had if both parts are
OK, a lesser gain is had when one part is OK, and a drastic
�ost is incurred if both parts are faulty (e.g., machine M3
iS destroyed). The specific problem parameters are given in
Table 1.

nal stage; and the former, Pr(FM,F3), is needed to accu­
rately assess Pr(F3,F4) at the subsequent stage. Thus we
maintain an approximate belief state with marginals involv­
ing no more than two variables, yet we are assured of acting
optimally.

Figure 6: DBN for the factory example

seven-stage DBN of the example.9 It is clear with three
stages to go, all the variables are correlated. If approximate
belief state monitoring is required for execution of the op­
timal policy (admittedly unlikely for such a simple prob­
lem!), a suitable projection scheme could be used.
Notice that the decisions to process P1 and P2 at stages-to­
go 3 and 2 are independent: they depend only on Pr(Fl)
and Pr(F2), respectively, but not on the correlation be­
tween the two variables. Thus, though these become quite
strongly correlated with five stages to go, this correlation
can be ignored without any impact on the decision one
would make at those points. Conversely,F3 andF4 become
much more weakly correlated with three stages to go; but
the optimal decision at the final stage does depend on their
joint probability. Were we to ignore this weak correlation,
we run the risk of acting suboptimally.
We ran the greedy search algorithm of Section 4.2 and, as
expected, it suggested projection schemes that break all cor­
relations except forFM andF3 with four stages to go, and
F3 andF4 with three, two, and one stage(s) to go. The lat­
ter, Pr(F3,F4), is clearly needed (at least for certain prior
probabilities onFM) to make the correct decision at the fi9
We have imposed certain constraints on actions to keep the
problem simple; with the addition of several variables, the prob­
lem could easily be formulated as a "true" DBN with identical dy­
namics and action choices at each time slice.

In contrast, if one chooses a projection scheme for this
problem by minimizing KL-divergence, L1-distance, or
Lz-distance, different correlations will generally be pre­
served. For instance, assuming a uniform prior overFM
(i.e., machine M is faulty with probability 0.5), Table 5
shows the approximation error that is incurred according
to each such measure when only the correlation between
F1 andF2 is maintained or when only the correlation be­
tweenF3 andF4 is maintained. All of these "direct" mea­
sures of belief state error prefer the former. However, the
loss in expected value due to the former belief state approx­
imation is 1 .0, whereas no loss is incurred using the lat­
ter. To test this further, we also compared the approxima­
tion preferred using these measures over 1 000 (uniformly)
randomly-generated prior distributions. If only theF1 jF2correlation is preserved at the first stage, then in 520 in­
stances a non-optimal action is executed with an average
loss of 0.6858. This clearly demonstrates the advantage of
using a value-directed method to choose good approxima­
tion schemes.

Framework Extensions

The methods described above provide means to analyze
value-directed approximations. Though we focused above
on projection schemes, approximate monitoring can be ef­
fected by other means. Our framework allows for the anal­
ysis of error of any linear approximation scheme S. In fact,
our analysis is better suited to linear approximations: the
constraints on the approximate belief state S (b), if linear,
allow us to construct exact switch sets Sw( a ) rather than ap­
proximations, providing still tighter bounds.
One linear approximation scheme involves the use of den­
sity trees [13]. A density tree represents a distribution by
aggregation: the tree splits on variables, and probabilities
labeling the leaves denote the probability of every state con­
sistent with the corresponding branch. For instance, the

506

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTI FICIAL I NTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

tree in Figure 7 d�notes a dist_!'ibution over four variables
in which states cdef and cdef both have probability 0 . 1 .
A tree that i s polynomially-sized i n the number of variables
offers an exponential reduction in the number of parameters
required to represent a distribution. A belief state can be ap­
proximated by forcing it to fit within a tree of a bounded size
(or satisfying other constraints). This approximation can be
reconstructed at each stage, just like projection. It is clear
that a density tree approximation is linear. Furthermore, the
number of constraints and required variables in the LP for
computing a switch set is small.
We also hope to extend this framework to analyze sampling
methods [ 1 1 , 1 3, 1 9] . While such schemes are generally an­
alyzed from the point of view of belief-state error, we would
like to consider the impact of sampling on decision quality
and develop value-directed sampling techniques that mini­
mize this impact.

Concluding Remarks

The value-directed approximation analysis we have pre­
sented takes a rather different view of belief state approxi­
mation than that adopted in previous work. Rather than try­
ing to ensure that the approximate belief state is as close as
possible to the true belief state, we try to make the approx­
imate belief state induce decisions that are as close as pos­
sible to optimal, given constraints on (say) the size of the
belief state clusters we wish to maintain. Our approach re­
mains tractable by exploiting recent results on factored rep­
resentations of value functions.
There are a number of directions in which this research
must be taken to verify its practicality. We are currently ex­
perimenting with the four bounding algorithms described
in section 4.2. Ultimately, although these algorithms pro­
vide worst-case bounds on the expected error, it is of in­
terest to gain some insight regarding the average error in­
curred in practice. We are also experimenting with other
heuristics, such as the the vector-space method mentioned
in Section 3 . I , that may provide a tradeoff between the qual­
ity of the error bounds and the efficiency of their compu­
tation. Other directions include the development of online,
dynamic choice of projection schemes for use in search-tree
approaches to POMDPs (see, e.g., [ 1 4]), as well as solving
POMDPs in a bounded-optimal way that takes into account
the fact that belief state monitoring will be approximate.
