INTRODUCTION

Influence diagrams were introduced by Howard and
Matheson (1981) as a formalism to model decision

INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

An

influence diagram is a belief network augmented

problems with uncertainty for a single decision maker.

with decision variables and a utility function.

The original way to evaluate such problems involved

The structure of a decision problem is determined by

unfolding the influence diagram into a decision tree
and using the "average-out and fold-back" algorithm
on that tree. Shachter (1986) describes a way to eval­

uate an influence diagram without tranforming it into
a decision tree. The method operates directly on the
influence diagram by means of the node-removal and
arc-reversal operations. These operations successively
transform the diagram, ending with a diagram with
only one utility node that holds the utility of the op­
timal decision policy; the policies for the individual
decisions are computed during the operation of the
algorithm (when decision nodes are removed).
Shenoy (1992) describes another approach to the eval­
uation of influence diagrams: the influence diagram is
converted to a valuation network, and the nodes are
removed from this network by fusing the valuations
bearing on the node (variable) to be removed. Shenoys
algorithm is slightly more efficient than Shachters al­
gorithm in that it maintains a system of valuations,

an acyclic directed graph G. The vertices of G repre­
sent either random variables (also known as chance or
probabilistic variables) or decision variables, and the
edges represent probabilistic dependencies between
variables. Decision variables represent actions that are
under the full control of the decision maker; hence, we
do not allow decision variables to have parents in the
graph.

We associate with each random variable A a condi­
tional probability function ¢A=P(AI:PA), where 'J'A
denotes the set of parents of A in G .
The state space Xv for V � U i s defined a s the Carte­
sian product of the sets of possible outcomes/decision
alternatives for the individual variables in V. A po­
tential ¢v for a set V of variables is a function from
Xv to the set of real numbers.
The potential <Pv can be extended to a potential

¢w (V � W) by simply ignoring the extra variables:
¢w(w) =¢v(v) ifv is the projection ofw on V.
Given two potentials, <P and tf!. The product ¢ * tV
and the quotient ¢/tf! are defined in the natural way,
except that 0/0 is defined to be 0 (x/0 for x -1= 0 is
undefined) .
The (a priori) joint probability function <Pu is defined
as

For each instance of Uo (i.e., each element of

Xu0 ),

A solution to the decision problem consists of a series
of decisions that maximizes some objective function.
Such a function is called a utility function. Without
loss of generality, we may assume that the utility func­
tion tfJ is a potential that may be written as a sum of
(possibly) simpler potentials:

The independence restriction imposed on the decision
problem can be verified by checking that, in the influ­
ence diagram, there is no directed path from a deci­
sion Ok to a decision Di (i < k).

DECISION MAKING

Assume we have to choose an alternative for deci­
sion On (i.e., the last decision). We have already
observed the random variables 10, . . . , In-1, and we
have chosen alternatives for decisions D1 , ..., 0 n-1.
The maximum expected utility principle2 says that
we should choose the alternative that maximizes the
expected utility. The maximum expected utility for
decision Dn is given by

Pn =max L P(Inllo, · · ·, In-1, 01, ..., Dn) * tf!.
On

I,

Obviously, Pn is a function of previous observations
and decisions. We calculate the maximum expected
utility for decision Dk (k < n) in a similar way:

Pk =Df,ax L P(Ikllo, ... , Ik-1, o, . . . , Dk) *Pk+1·
k

I<

We note that Pk is well-defined because of ( 1).
By expansion of ( 2 ) , we get

Pk =max L P(Ikllo,... , Ik-1, D 1, ... , Dk)
Dk

Ik

*max
Dk+l

=max
We need to impose a restriction on the decision prob­
lem, namely that a decision cannot have an impact on
a variable already observed. This translates into the
property

P(Ikllo, ... , Ik-1, D1, ... , On)
=P(Ikllo, ... ,Ik-1.01, ... ,0kl·

(1)

In words: we can calculate the joint distribution for I k
without knowledge of the states of Dk+ 1, ... , Dn (i.e.,
the future decisions).
2.1

GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION

In Figure 1, an example of an influence diagram is
shown. Random variables are depicted as circles, and
decision variables are depicted as squares. Moreover,
each term of the utility function is depicted as a dia­
mond, and the domain of the term is indicated by its
parent set. The partial order-< is indicated by making
I k-1 the parent set of D k, and we shall use the con­
vention that the temporal order of the decisions are
read from left to right.

From this formula, we see that in order to calculate
the maximum expected utility for a decision, we have
to perform a series of marginalizations (alternately
sum- and max-marginalizations), thereby eliminating
the variables.
When we eliminate a variable A from a function ¢,
expressible as a product of simpler functions, we par­
tition the factors into two groups: the factors that
involve A, and the factors that do not; call (the prod­
uct of) these factors ¢ :t_ and ¢A, respectively. The
marginal LA¢ is then equal to <PA: *LA¢:t_; LA <Pt
2There are good arguments for adhering to this principle.

T he probability potential for

the conditional probability functions for the variables

to them, the probability potentials are unit functions.
In this way, the joint probability potential for the junc­

Clearly, the complexity of an absorption operation is

By successively absorbing leaves into a strong junction

The optimal p olicy for a decision variable can be deter­

mined from the potentials on the clique that is closest

to the strong root and contains the decision variable
(that clique may be the root itself), since all variables
that the decision variable may depend on will also be
members of that clique.

For our example decision problem (Figure 4), we can
determine the optimal policy for 01 from {the poten­

for the remaining decisions can be determined from

should be noted that only storage for the 'active' part
of the junction tree during the collect operation needs
to be reserved; this means that storage for at most
two adjacent cliques and each clique that corresponds
to a branch point on the currently active path from

the root to a leaf

must be reserved. Since elimination

of a group of variables can be implemented more effi­

ciently than the corresponding series of single-variable
eliminations, it is still useful to organize the computa­

We have not given an algorithm to construct the elim­
ination sequence that generates the strong triangula­
tion. However, the triangulation problem is simpler
than for ordinary probability propagation, since the
set of admissible elimination sequences is smaller; at
this stage, it appears that simple adaptations of the
heuristic algorithms described by Kjcerulff (1990) work
very well. Moreover, even given a triangulation, there
might exist several strong junction trees for the collec­
tion of diques.
Besides the use of the strong junction tree for compu­
tation of expected utilities and optimal decision poli­
cies, it should be possible to exploit the junction tree
for computation of probabilities for random variables
that only depend on decisions that have already been
made. Ideally, this should be done through a 'dis­
tribute' operation from the root towards the leaves of
the junction tree.
Work regarding these problems is in progress.
