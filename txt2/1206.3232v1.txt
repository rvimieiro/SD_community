its estimates have lower variance.
We present a detailed experimental evaluation comparing
importance sampling with AND/OR importance sampling
on Bayesian network benchmarks. We observe that the
latter outperforms the former on most benchmarks and in
some cases quite significantly.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, we describe preliminaries on graphical models, importance sampling and AND/OR search spaces. In sections
3, 4 and 5 we formally describe AND/OR importance sampling and prove that its sample mean has lower variance
than conventional importance sampling. Experimental results are described in section 6 and we conclude with a discussion of related work and summary in section 7.

2 Preliminaries
We represent sets by bold capital letters and members of a
set by capital letters. An assignment of a value to a variable
is denoted by a small letter while bold small letters indicate
an assignment to a set of variables.
Definition 2.1 (belief networks). A belief network (BN) is
a graphical model R = (X, D, P), where X = {X1 , . . . , Xn }
is a set of random variables over multi-valued domains
D = {D1 , . . . , Dn }. Given a directed acyclic graph G over
X, P = {Pi }, where Pi = P(Xi |pa(Xi )) are conditional probability tables (CPTs) associated with each Xi . pa(Xi ) is
the set of parents of the variable Xi in G. A belief network represents a probability distribution over X, P(X) =

The notation h(X)|E=e stands for a function h over X \ E

2.1

AND/OR search spaces

We can compute probability of evidence by search, by accumulating probabilities over the search space of instantiated variables. In the simplest case, this process defines an
OR search tree, whose nodes represent partial variable assignments. This search space does not capture the structure of the underlying graphical model. To remedy this
problem, [Dechter and Mateescu, 2007] introduced the notion of AND/OR search space. Given a bayesian network
R = (X, D, P), its AND/OR search space is driven by a
pseudo tree defined below.
Definition 2.3 (Pseudo Tree). Given an undirected graph
G = (V, E), a directed rooted tree T = (V, E) defined on all
its nodes is called pseudo tree if any arc of G which is not
included in E is a back-arc, namely it connects a node to an
ancestor in T .
Definition 2.4 (Labeled AND/OR tree). Given a graphical model R = hX, D, Pi, its primal graph G and a backbone pseudo tree T of G, the associated AND/OR search
tree, has alternating levels of AND and OR nodes. The OR
nodes are labeled Xi and correspond to the variables. The
AND nodes are labeled hXi , xi i and correspond to the value
assignments in the domains of the variables. The structure
of the AND/OR search tree is based on the underlying backbone tree T . The root of the AND/OR search tree is an OR
node labeled by the root of T .
Each OR arc, emanating from an OR node to an
AND node is associated with a label which can
be derived from the CPTs of the bayesian network

[Dechter and Mateescu, 2007]. Each OR node and AND
node is also associated with a value that is used for computing the quantity of interest.
Semantically, the OR states represent alternative assignments, whereas the AND states represent problem decomposition into independent subproblems, all of which
need be solved.
When the pseudo-tree is a chain,
the AND/OR search tree coincides with the regular OR
search tree. The probability of evidence can be computed from a labeled AND/OR tree by recursively computing the value of all nodes from leaves to the root
[Dechter and Mateescu, 2007].
Example 2.5. Figure 1(a) shows a bayesian network over
seven variables with domains of {0, 1}. F and G are evidence nodes. Figure 1(c) shows the AND/OR-search tree
for the bayesian network based on the Pseudo-tree in Figure
1(b). Note that because F and G are instantiated, the search
space has only 5 variables.
2.2 Computing Probability of Evidence Using
Importance Sampling
Importance sampling [Rubinstein, 1981] is a simulation
technique commonly used to evaluate the sum, M =
∑x∈X f (x) for some real function f . The idea is to generate
samples x1 , . . . , xN from a proposal distribution Q (satisfying f (x) > 0 ⇒ Q(x) > 0) and then estimate M as follows:
M=

∑

x∈X

f (x) =

w is often referred to as the sample weight. It is known that

the expected value E(M)
To compute the probability of evidence by importance sampling, we use the substitution:
n

f (x) = ∏ P(X j |pa(X j ))|E=e

(4)

j=1

Several choices are available for the proposal distribution Q(x) ranging from the prior distribution as in likelihood weighting to more sophisticated alternatives such as

IJGP-Sampling [Gogate and Dechter, 2005] and EPIS-BN
[Yuan and Druzdzel, 2006] where the output of belief propagation is used to compute the proposal distribution.
As in prior work [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000], we assume that the proposal distribution is expressed in a factored product form: Q(X) = ∏ni=1 Qi (Xi |X1 , . . . , Xi−1 ) =
∏ni=1 Qi (Xi |Yi ), where Yi ⊆ {X1 , . . . , Xi−1 }, Qi (Xi |Yi ) =
Q(Xi |X1 , . . . , Xi−1 ) and |Yi | < c for some constant c. We
can generate a full sample from Q as follows. For i =
1 to n, sample Xi = xi from the conditional distribution
Q(Xi |X1 = x1 , . . . , Xi−1 = xi−1 ) and set Xi = xi .

AND/OR importance sampling

We first discuss computing expectation by parts; which
forms the backbone of AND/OR importance sampling. We
then present the AND/OR importance sampling scheme
formally and derive its properties.
3.1

Estimating Expectation by Parts

In Equation 2, the expectation of a multi-variable function
is computed by summing over the entire domain. This
method is clearly inefficient because it does not take into
account the decomposition of the multi-variable function as
we illustrate below.
Consider the tree graphical model given in Figure 2(a).
Let A = a and B = b be the evidence variables. Let
Q(ZXY ) = Q(Z)Q(X|Z)Q(Y |Z) be the proposal distribution. For simplicity, let us assume that f (Z) = P(Z),
f (XZ) = P(Z|X)P(A = a|X) and f (Y Z) = P(Z|Y )P(B =
b|Y ). We can express probability of evidence P(a, b) as:
f (Z) f (XZ) f (Y Z)
Q(Z)Q(X|Z)Q(Y |Z)
Q(Z)Q(X|Z)Q(Y

By definition, Equation 7 can be written as:

The quantities in the two brackets in Equation 6 are, by definition, conditional expectations of a function over X and Y
respectively given Z. Therefore, Equation 6 can be written
as:


Importance sampling ignores the decomposition of expectation while approximating it by the sample average. Our
new algorithm estimates the true expectation by decomposing it into several conditional expectations and then approximating each by an appropriate weighted average over the
samples. Since computing expectation by parts is less complex than computing expectation by summing over the domain; we expect that approximating it by parts will be easier as well. We next illustrate how to estimate expectation
by parts on our example Bayesian network given in Figure
2(a).

We will refer to Equations of the form 8 as expectation by
parts borrowing from similar terms such as integration and
summation by parts. If the domain size of all variables is
d = 3, for example, computing expectation using Equation 5 would require summing over d 3 = 33 = 27 terms
while computing the same expectation by parts would require summing over d + d 2 + d 2 = 3 + 32 + 32 = 21 terms.
Therefore, exactly computing expectation by parts is clearly
more efficient.

Equation 10 which is an unbiased estimator of expectation
by parts given in Equation 8 provides another rationale for
preferring it over the usual importance sampling estimator
given by Equation 11. In particular in Equation 10, we
estimate two functions defined over the random variables
X|Z = z and Y |Z = z respectively from the generated samples. In importance sampling, on the other hand, we estimate a function over the joint random variable XY |Z = z using the generated samples. Because the samples for X|Z = z
and Y |Z = z are considered independently in Equation 10,
N j samples drawn over the joint random variable XY |Z = z
in Equation 11 correspond to a larger set N j ∗ N j = N 2j of
virtual samples. We know that [Rubinstein, 1981] the variance (and therefore the mean-squared error) of an unbiased
estimator decreases with an increase in the effective sample
size. Consequently, our new estimation technique will have
lower error than the conventional approach.
In the following subsection, we discuss how the AND/OR
structure can be used for estimating expectation by parts
yielding the AND/OR importance sampling scheme.
3.2

Computing Sample Mean in AND/OR-space

In this subsection, we formalize the ideas of estimating
expectation by parts on a general AND/OR tree starting
with some required definitions. We define the notion of an
AND/OR sample tree which is restricted to the generated
samples and which will be used to compute the AND/OR
sample mean. The labels on this AND/OR tree are set to
account for the importance weights.
Definition 3.1 (Arc Labeled AND/OR Sample Tree).
Given a a graphical model R = hX, D, Pi, a pseudo-tree
T (V, E) , a proposal distribution Q = ∏ni=1 Q(Xi |Anc(Xi ))
such that Anc(Xi ) is a subset of all ancestors of Xi in
T , a sequence of assignments (samples) S and a complete
AND/OR search tree φT , an AND/OR sample tree SAOT is
constructed from φT by removing all edges and corresponding nodes which are not in S i.e. they are not sampled.
The Arc-label for an OR node Xi to an AND node Xi = xi
in SAOT is a pair hw, #i where:
P(Xi =xi ,anc(xi ))
• w = Q(X
is called the weight of the arc.
i =xi |anc(xi ))
anc(xi ) is the assignment of values to all variables

from the node Xi to the root node of SAO and P(Xi =
xi , anc(xi )) is the product of all functions in R that
mention Xi but do not mention any variable ordered
below it in T given (Xi = xi , anc(xi )).
• # is the frequency of the arc. Namely, it is equal to
the number of times the assignment (Xi = xi , anc(xi ))
is sampled.
Example 3.2. Consider again the Bayesian network given
in Figure 2(a). Assume that the proposal distribution
Q(XY Z) is uniform. Figure 2(b) shows four hypothetical random samples drawn from Q. Figure 2(c) shows the
AND/OR sample tree over the four samples. Each arc from
an OR node to an AND node in the AND/OR sample tree
is labeled with appropriate frequencies and weights according to Definition 3.1. Figure 2(c) shows the derivation of
arc-weights for two arcs.
The main virtue of arranging the samples on an AND/OR
sample tree is that we can exploit the independencies to define the AND/OR sample mean.
Definition 3.3 (AND/OR Sample Mean). Given a
AND/OR sample tree with arcs labeled according to Definition 3.1, the value of a node is defined recursively as
follows. The value of leaf AND nodes is ”1” and the value
of leaf OR nodes is ”0”. Let C(n) denote the child nodes
and v(n) denotes the value of node n. If n is a AND node
then: v(n) = ∏n′ ∈C(n) v(n′ ) and if n is a OR node then
v(n) =

∑n′ ∈C(n) (#(n, n′ )w(n, n′ )v(n′ ))
∑n′ ∈C(n) #(n, n′ )

The AND/OR sample mean is the value of the root node.
We can show that the value of an OR node is equal to an
unbiased estimate of the conditional expectation of the variable at the OR node given an assignment from the root to
the parent of the OR node. Since all variables, except the
evidence variables are unassigned at the root node, the value
of the root node equals the AND/OR sample mean which is
an unbiased estimate of probability of evidence. Formally,
T HEOREM 3.4. The AND/OR sample mean is an unbiased
estimate of probability of evidence.

3.3. The value of OR nodes X and Y given Z = j ∈ {0, 1}
is equal to gX\
(Z = j) and gY\
(Z = j) respectively defined
in Equation 9. The value of the root node is equal to the
AND/OR sample mean which is equal to the sample mean
computed by parts in Equation 10.

a proposal distribution Q
Output: Estimate of Probability of Evidence

∑n′ ∈C(n) #(n, n′ )
10: Return v(root node)

We now have the necessary definitions to formally present
the AND/OR importance sampling scheme (see Algorithm
1). In Steps 1-3, the algorithm generates samples from Q
and stores them on an AND/OR sample tree. The algorithm then computes the AND/OR sample mean over the
AND/OR sample tree recursively from leaves to the root in
Steps 4 − 9. We can show that the value v(n) of a node
in the AND/OR sample tree stores the sample average of
the subproblem rooted at n, subject to the current variable
instantiation along the path from the root to n. If n is the
root, then v(n) is the AND/OR sample mean which is our
AND/OR estimator of probability of evidence. Finally, we
summarize the complexity of computing AND/OR sample
mean in the following theorem:
T HEOREM 3.6. Given N samples and n variables (with

In this section, we prove that the AND/OR sample mean
may have lower variance than the sample mean computed
using importance sampling (Equation 3).
T HEOREM 4.1 (Variance Reduction). Variance of AND/OR
sample mean is less than or equal to the variance of importance sampling sample mean.
Proof. The details of the proof are quite complicated and
therefore we only provide the intuitions involved. As noted
earlier the guiding principle of AND/OR sample mean is to
take advantage of conditional independence in the graphical model. Let us assume that we have three random variables X, Y and Z with the following relationship: X and Y
are independent of each other given Z (similar to our example Bayesian network). The expression for variance derived
here can be used in an induction step (induction is carried
on the nodes of the pseudo tree) to prove the theorem.
In this case, importance sampling generates samples
((x1 , y1 , z1 ), . . . , (xN , yN , zN )) along the order hZ, X, Yi and
estimates the mean as follows:
∑Ni=1 xi yi zi
(12)
N
Without loss of generality, let {z1 , z2 } be the domain of Z
and let these values be sampled N1 and N2 times respectively. We can rewrite Equation 12 as follows:

µ IS (XYZ) =

µ IS (XYZ) =

∑ N j zj

(13)

where I(z j , xi , yi ) is an indicator function which is 1 iff the
partial assignment (z j , xi , yi ) is generated in any of the N
samples and 0 otherwise.
AND/OR sample mean is defined as:
µ AO (XYZ) =

where I(x j , zi ) (and similarly I(y j , zi )) is an indicator function which equals 1 when one of the N samples contains the
tuple (x j , zi ) (and similarly (y j , zi ))) and is 0 otherwise.
By simple algebraic manipulations, we can prove that the
variance of estimator µ IS (XYZ) is given by:
Var(µ IS (XYZ)) =

Similarly, the variance of AND/OR sample mean is given
by:
Var(µ AO (XYZ)) =

∑ z2j Q(zj )

(16)

where µ (X|z j ) and V (X|z j ) are the conditional mean and
variance respectively of X given Z = z j . Similarly, µ (Y|z j )
and V (Y|z j ) are the conditional mean and variance respectively of Y given Z = z j .
From Equations 15 and 16, if N j = 1 for all j, then we can
see that the Var(µ AO (XYZ)) = Var(µ IS (XYZ)). However
if N j > 1, Var(µ AO (XYZ)) < Var(µ IS (XYZ)). This proves
that the variance of AND/OR sample mean is less than or
equal to the variance of conventional sample mean on this
special case. As noted earlier using this case in induction
over the nodes of a general pseudo-tree completes the proof.

Estimation in AND/OR graphs

Next, we describe a more powerful algorithm for
estimating mean in AND/OR-space by moving from
AND/OR-trees to AND/OR graphs as presented in
[Dechter and Mateescu, 2007]. An AND/OR-tree may contain nodes that root identical subtrees. When such unifiable
nodes are merged, the tree becomes a graph and its size
becomes smaller. Some unifiable nodes can be identified
using contexts defined below.
Definition 5.1 (Context). Given a belief network and the
corresponding AND/OR search tree SAOT relative to a
pseudo-tree T , the context of any AND node hXi , xi i ∈ SAOT
, denoted by context(Xi ), is defined as the set of ancestors
of Xi in T , that are connected to Xi and descendants of Xi .
The context minimal AND/OR graph is obtained by merging all the context unifiable AND nodes. The size of the
largest context is bounded by the tree width w∗ of the
pseudo-tree [Dechter and Mateescu, 2007]. Therefore, the
time and space complexity of a search algorithm traversing
the context-minimal AND/OR graph is O(exp(w∗ )).
Example 5.2. For illustration, consider the contextminimal graph in Figure 1(e) of the pseudo-tree from Figure 1(c). Its size is far smaller that that of the AND/OR tree
from Figure 2(c) (30 nodes vs. 38 nodes). The contexts of
the nodes can be read from the pseudo-tree in Figure 1(b)
as follows: context(A) = {A}, context(B) = {B,A}, context(C) = {C,B,A}, context(D) = {D,C,B} and context(E) =
{E,A,B}.
The main idea in AND/OR-graph estimation is to store all
samples on an AND/OR-graph instead of an AND/OR-tree.

Similar to an AND/OR sample tree, we can define an identical notion of an AND/OR sample graph.
Definition 5.3 ( Arc labeled AND/OR sample graph).
Given a complete AND/OR graph φG and a set of samples S
, an AND/OR sample graph SAOG is obtained by removing
all nodes and arcs not in S from φG . The labels on SAOG are
set similar to that of an AND/OR sample tree (see Definition 3.1).
Example 5.4. The bold edges and nodes in Figure 1(c) define an AND/OR sample tree. The bold edges and nodes in
Figure 1(d) define an AND/OR sample graph corresponding to the same samples that define the AND/OR sample
tree in Figure 1(c).
The algorithm for computing the sample mean on AND/OR
sample graphs is identical to the algorithm for AND/ORtree (Steps 4-10 of Algorithm 1). The main reason in moving from trees to graphs is that the variance of the sample
mean computed on an AND/OR sample graph can be even
smaller than that computed on an AND/OR sample tree.
More formally,
T HEOREM 5.5. Let V (µAOG ), V (µAOT ) and V (µIS ) be the
variance of AND/OR sample mean on an AND/OR sample
graph, variance of AND/OR sample mean on an AND/OR
sample tree and variance of sample mean of importance
sampling respectively. Then given the same set of input
samples:
V (µAOG ) ≤ V (µAOT ) ≤ V (µIS )
We omit the proof due to lack of space.
T HEOREM 5.6 (Complexity of computing AND/OR graph
sample mean). Given a graphical model with n variables,
a psuedo-tree with treewidth w∗ and N samples, the time
complexity of AND/OR graph sampling is O(nNw∗ ) while
its space complexity is O(nN).

6 Experimental Evaluation
6.1 Competing Algorithms
The performance of importance sampling based algorithms is highly dependent on the proposal distribution
[Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000]. It was shown that computing
the proposal distribution from the output of a Generalized
Belief Propagation scheme of Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) yields better empirical performance than other
available choices [Gogate and Dechter, 2005]. Therefore,
we use the output of IJGP to compute the proposal distribution Q. The complexity of IJGP is time and space exponential in its i-bound, a parameter that bounds cluster sizes.
We use a i-bound of 5 in all our experiments.
We experimented with three sampling algorithms for
benchmarks which do not have determinism: (a) (pure)
IJGP-sampling, (b) AND/OR-tree IJGP-sampling and (c)
AND/OR-graph IJGP-sampling. Note that the underlying
scheme for generating the samples is identical in all the

Grid Networks All Grid instances have 1444 binary nodes
and between 5-10 evidence nodes. From Figures 5(a) and
5(b), we can see that AND/OR-graph SampleSearch and
AND/OR-tree SampleSearch are substantially better than
pure SampleSearch.
Linkage Networks The linkage instances are generated by converting a Pedigree to a Bayesian network
[Fishelson and Geiger, 2003]. These networks have between 777-2315 nodes with a maximum domain size of
36. Note that it is hard to compute exact probability of evidence in these networks [Fishelson and Geiger, 2003]. We
observe from Figures 6(a),(b) (c) and (d) that AND/ORgraph SampleSearch is substantially more accurate than
AND/OR-tree SampleSearch which in turn is substantially
more accurate than pure SampleSearch. Notice the logscale in Figures 6 (a)-(d) which means that there is an order of magnitude difference between the errors. Our results
suggest that AND/OR-graph and tree estimators yield far
better performance than conventional estimators especially
on problems in which the proposal distribution is a bad approximation of the posterior distribution.

Random Networks From Figures 4(a) and 4(b), we see
that AND/OR-graph sampling is better than AND/OR-tree
sampling which in turn is better than pure IJGP-sampling.
However there is not much difference in the error because
the proposal distribution seems to be a very good approximation of the posterior.

Our results are presented in Figures 4-6. Each Figure shows
approximate probability of evidence as a function of time.
The bold line in each Figure indicates the exact probability of evidence. The reader can visualize the error from
the distance between the approximate curves and the exact line. For lack of space, we show only part of our results. Each Figure shows the number of variables n, the
maximum-domain size d and the number of evidence nodes
|E| for the respective benchmark.

We experimented with three sets of benchmark belief networks (a) Random networks, (b) Linkage networks and (c)
Grid networks. Note that only linkage and grid networks
have zero probabilities on which we use SampleSearch.The

samples and deriving the estimates. On benchmarks which
have zero probabilities or determinism, we use the SampleSearch scheme introduced by [Gogate and Dechter, 2007]
to overcome the rejection problem. We experiment with the
following versions of SampleSearch on deterministic networks: (a) pure SampleSearch, (b) AND/OR-tree SampleSearch and (c) AND/OR-graph SampleSearch.

To summarize, the paper introduces a new sampling based
estimation technique called AND/OR importance sampling. The main idea of our new scheme is to derive statistics on the generated samples by using an AND/OR tree or
graph that takes advantage of the independencies present
in the graphical model. We proved that the sample mean
computed on an AND/OR tree or graph may have smaller
variance than the sample mean computed using the conventional approach. Our experimental evaluation is preliminary but quite promising showing that on most instances
AND/OR sample mean has lower error than importance
sampling and sometimes by significant margins.

exact computations to achieve variance reduction. In
fact, variance reduction due to Rao-Blackwellisation is
orthogonal to the variance reduction achieved by AND/OR
estimation and therefore the two could be combined to
achieve more variance reduction. Also, unlike our work
which focuses on probability of evidence, the focus of
these aforementioned papers was on belief updating.

Similar to recent work on Rao-Blackwellised sampling such as [Bidyuk and Dechter, 2003, Paskin, 2004,

in these junction tree based sampling schemes because of
some exact computations; as dictated by the Rao-Blackwell
