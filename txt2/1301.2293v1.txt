Introduction

Belief aggregation of subjective probability distributions
has been a subject of great interest in statistics (see [GZ86,
CW99]) and, more recently, artificial intelligence (e.g.,
[PW99]) and machine learning (ensemble learning in par­
ticular [PMGHOO]), especially since probabilistic distribu­
tions are increasingly being used in medicine and other
fields to encode knowledge of experts. Unfortunately,
many of the aggregation proposals have lacked sufficient
semantical underpinnings, typically evaluating a mecha­
nism by how well it satisfies properties justified by little
more than intuition. However, as has been noted in other
fields such as belief revision (cf. [FH96]), the appropriate­
ness of properties depends on the particular context.
We take a more semantic approach to aggregation: we first
describe the realistic framework in which the experts or
sources learn their probability distributions from data us­
ing standard probabilistic learning techniques. We assume

a Decision Maker (DM)- the traditional name for the ag­
gregator - wants to aggregate a set of these learned dis­
tributions. This framework suggests a natural optimal ag­
gregation mechanism: construct the distribution that would
be learned had all the sources' data sets been available to
the DM. Since the original data sets are generally not avail­
able, the aggregation mechanism should come as close as
possible to reconstructing the data sets and learning from
the combined set.
For intuition, consider the the task of creating an expert
system for some specialized medical field. We would like
to take advantage of the expertise of several doctors work­
ing in this field. Each of these doctors sharpened his
knowledge by following many patients. The doctors can
no longer recall the specifics of each case, but they have
formed over the years fairly accurate models of the do­
main that can be represented as sets of conditional prob­
abilities. (In fact, many expert systems have been created
over the years by eliciting such conditional probabilities
from experts [HHN92].) Of course, if there was a doctor
who had seen all of the patients the others doctors saw, the
ideal expert system would result from eliciting her model.
However, there isn't one such expert. Therefore, our sys­
tem would benefit from incorporating the knowledge of as
many experts as we can find. The system would also ac­
count for the differing levels of experience of different doc­
tors - some of them may have practiced for much longer
than others.
One of the best-known aggregation operators is the Lin­
ear Opinion Pool (LinOP) which aggregates a set of distri­
butions by taking their weighted sum. It has been shown
in the statistics community that, under some intuitive as­
sumptions, learning the joint distribution from the com­
bined data set is equivalent to using LinOP over the individ­
ual joint distributions learned from the individual data sets.
However, whereas the weights in typical uses of LinOP
are often criticized for being ad-hoc, our framework pre­
scribes semantically-justified weights: the estimated per­
centages of the data each source saw. Intuitively, a high
weight means we believe a source has seen a relatively

UAI2001

large amount of data and is, hence, likely to be reliable.

are complete (no missing values).

However, joint distributions are hardly the preferred rep­
resentation for probabilistic beliefs in real-world domains.
BNs (aka belief networks, etc.) [Pea88] have gained much
popularity as structured representations of probability dis­
tributions. They allow such distributions to be represented
much more compactly, therefore often avoiding exponen­
tial blowup in both memory size and inference complexity.

Second, we assume that the individual sample sets are dis­
joint (so M
Ei Mi). This implies that the concatenation
of the Di equals D, so we don't have to concern ourselves
with repeats when aggregating. This assumption is not al­
ways appropriate. It is invalidated when multiple sources
observe the same event. However, there are interesting do­
mains where this property holds. For example, in our mo­
tivating medical domain, doctors are likely to have seen
disjoint sets of patients.

Thus, we assume the sources beliefs are BNs learned from
data. According to our semantics, the aggregate BN should
be one the DM would learn from the combined sets of data.
We describe a LinOP-based BN aggregation algorithm, in­
spired by the algorithm designed to learn BNs from data.
The algorithm uses sources' distributions instead of sam­
ples to search over possible BN structures and parameter
settings. It takes advantage of the marginalization prop­
erty of LinOP to make computation more efficient. We ex­
plore the algorithm's behavior by running experiments on
the well-known, real-life Alarm network [BSCC89] and on
the smaller artificial Asia network [LS88].

Formal Preliminaries

We restrict our attention to domains with discrete variables.
We consider how to compute the aggregate distribution,
and how the accuracy of our computation depends on how
much we know about the sources.
Formally, we consider the following setting: There are L
sources and N discrete random variables, where each vari­
able X has domain dom(X). We follow the convention of
using capital letters to denote variables and lowercase let­
ters to denote their values. Symbols in bold denote sets. W
is the set of possible worlds defined by value assignments
to variables. The true distribution or model of the world is
1r. Each source i has a data set Di sampled from (unknown
to us) rr. We will assume that each Di is finite of size Mi.
The corresponding empirical (i.e., frequency) distribution
is Pi· Each source i learns a distribution Pi over W. This
is i's model of the world. The combined set of samples is
D UiDi of size M. The corresponding empirical distri­
bution is p. The DM constructs an aggregate distribution p.
*
The optimal aggregate distribution p is posited to be the
distribution the DM would learn from D.
=

Since it is unrealistic to expect the DM to have access to the
sources' sample sets, we consider how to use information
about the sources' learned distributions to at least approx­
*
imate p . Specifically, we consider the situation where the
DM knows the sources' distributions and has a good esti­
mate of the percentage ai = MdM of the combined set of
samples each source i has observed as well as what learn­
ing method it used.
We make a number of assumptions. First, we assume that
the samples are not noisy or otherwise corrupted, and they

=

Third, we assume that the sources believe their samples to
be liD- independent and identically distributed. The ma­
chine learning algorithms used in practice commonly rely
on this assumption.
Finally, we assume that the samples in the combined set D
are sampled from 1r and liD. This assumption may appear
overly restrictive at first glance. For one, it may seem to
preclude the common situation where sources receive sam­
ples from different subpopulations. For example, if doctors
are in different parts of the world, the characteristics of the
patients they see will likely be different.
In fact, we can accomodate this situation within our frame­
work by assuming 1r is a distribution over the domain vari­
ables and a source variable S which takes the different
sources as values; S
i means source i observed the in­
stantiated domain variables. This generalized distribution
is sampled liD. Each Di consists of the subset of samples
where S = i. It is not necessary to keep around the S val­
*
ues; computing the Pi and p withoutS will give the same
results as learning distributions over the complete samples
and marginalizing outS. Thus, although samples will be
liD, different subpopulation distributions will be possible,
captured by different conditional probability distributions
of the domain variables given distinct values of S.1

Aggregating Learned Joint Distributions

We first consider the case where sources have learned joint
distributions, and the aggregate is also a joint.
3.1

Learning joint distributions: review

Given samples of a variable X, the goal of a learner is to es­
timate the probability of future occurences of each value of
X. In our setting, the domain of X is Wand the parameters
that need to be learned are the IWI probabilites. The dis­
tribution over X is parameterized by 0. Two standard ap­
proaches are Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and
Maximum A Posteriori estimation (MAP).
1 Two implications of this formulation are that the assumption
that the D; are disjoint is implicit and a; will approach 1r(S = i)
as M approaches oo for all i.

MLE aggregation

been known in statistics for

some time,

the DM need only

compute the LinOP of the sources' distributions.

Although straight-forward, this proposition is illuminating.

For one, the weight corresponding to each source has a very
clear meaning; it is the percentage of total data seen by that
source. The DM only needs to provide accurate estimates
of these percentages. A high weight indicates that the DM
believes a source has seen a relatively large amount of data
and is, hence, likely to be very reliable. Thus, we address
a common criticism of LinOP, that the weights are often
chosen in an ad-hoc fashion. Also, if

MLE learners are known to have problems with overfitting

these problems, especially when data is sparse.
Consequently, suppose the sources and the DM are MAP
learners with Dirichlet priors. The optimal aggregate dis­

Learning Bayesian networks: review

If the structure of the network is known, the task reduces
to statistical parameter estimation by MLE or MAP. In the
case of complete data, the likelihood function for the entire
BN conveniently decomposes according to the structure of

the network, so we can maximize the likelihood of each
parameter independently.

We can take advantage of the marginalization property of
LinOP to make computation more efficient. As is noted
in [PW99], we can parameterize the network in top-down
fashion by first computing the distribution over the roots,
then joints over the second layer variables together with
their parents, etc. The conditional probabilities can be com­

Subpopulations

Our algorithm performs well when combining source dis­
tributions learned based on samples from different subpop­
ulations. To show this, we modified the Asia network to ac­
comodate two sources, a doctor practicing in San Francisco
and one practicing in Cincinnati. The probability distribu­
tions of the two root nodes in the Asia network, represent­
ing whether a patient smokes and whether she has visited
Asia would be significantly different for the two doctors.
A patient from San Francisco is less likely to be a smoker,
and one from Cincinnati

is less likely to have visited Asia.

Thus, we added a source variable as described in Section 2,
gave the sources equal priors of seeing patients, made the
source variable a parent of the two root variables, and gave
them appropriate CPDs. We drew

M samples from this

extended network and had each source learn from the ap­
propriate subset, then used AGGR to combine the results
using the correct ai and

Related Work

A wealth of work exists in statistics on aggregating prob­
ability distributions.

Good surveys of the field include

[GZ86, CW99]. Many of the earlier, axiomatic approaches
suffered from a lack of semantical grounding. For this rea­
son, the community moved towards modeling approaches
instead. The most studied approach has been the supra­
Bayesian one, introduced in [Win68] and formally estab­

lished in [Mor74, Mor77]. Here, the DM has a prior not
only over the variables in the domain, but over the possi­
ble beliefs of the sources as well. She aggregates by us­
ing Bayesian conditioning to incorporate the information
she receives from the sources. In fact, Proposition 1 de­
rives from this body of work. However, almost all of this
work has been restricted to aggregating beliefs represented
as point probabilities or odds, or joint distributions.
There has been some recent interest, particularly in AI, in

Comparison to sampling algorithm

In each of the above experiments, we also compared the
performance of our algorithm to the alternative intuitive al­

In some sense, what we are doing could also be viewed
as ensemble learning for BNs. Ensemble learning involves
combining the results of different weak learners to improve
classification accuracy. Because of its simplicity, LinOP is
often used without justification to do the actual combina­
tion. Our results justify this use when the weak learners
use MLE, MAP, or BN learning.

Conclusion

We have presented a new approach to belief aggregation.
We believe that we cannot formulate that problem pre­
cisely or measure success of different techniques without
answering questions about the way in which sources' be­
liefs were formulated.

We argued that a framework in

which the sources are assumed to have learned their distri­
butions from data is both intuitively plausible and leads to a
very natural formulation of the optimal DM distribution one which would be learned from the combined data sets
- and a natural success measure - a distance from the
generating, 'true' distribution.
Based on the observation that LinOP is the appropriate
operator for this framework if sources and DM are MLE
learners, we presented a LinOP-based algorithm to aggre­
gate beliefs represented by Bayesian networks. Our prelim­
inary results show that this algorithm performs very well.
One direction of future work will involve finding ways to
relax the various assumptions. For example, we would like

Thus, a second direction will involve finding valid ways of
taking advantage of sources' priors to improve the quality
of the aggregation. For example, if sources use Dirichlet
priors and the DM trusts their estimated sample sizes, she
may chose to incorporate them into her estimate of
