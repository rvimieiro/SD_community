One major restriction of these models is that they assume causal sufficiency: causes of at least two variables
already in the model must also be in the model. The
causal sufficiency assumption is often unreasonable in
practical causal inference problems, where partial observability is very common. Approaches to relaxing
causal sufficiency include the incorporation of latent
variables, or dependent error terms as in the so-called
‘semi-Markovian’ NPSEMs [6].
Of particular interest in causal inference is the problem
of determining causal effects, which are formalized as
joint distributions on outcome variables after an idealized experiment called an intervention is performed.
A variety of questions in empirical science can be formulated in terms of causal effects. Interventions can
sometimes be implemented by randomization, but this
frequently cannot be done due to expense or ethical
considerations. As a consequence, an important problem is determining in what situations a given causal
effect is identifiable from an observational distribution
induced by a causal model.
An algorithm for the causal effect identification problem was given in [19],[18],[14], with the completeness
of the algorithm established in [15],[14],[3]. This algorithm manipulates the observational distribution and
the graph until it either proves the manipulation results in the causal effect of interest or it fails. This
process always terminates after a number of recursive
calls polynomial in the number of nodes in the graph.
However, there is no known efficient scheme for the
manipulations of the observational distribution performed by this algorithm. We propose such a scheme
here.
This scheme takes advantages of a recursive factorization satisfied by observational distributions of DAG
models with latent variables that mirrors the recursive
algorithm for identifying causal effects. This recursive
factorization implies certain constraints which generalize conditional independence and which we call posttruncation independences. If causally interpretable,

these constraints are known as dormant independence
constraints [16]. The recursive factorization may also
be seen as a refinement of the simpler Markov factorization for ADMGs [8]. Our algorithm can be viewed
as a generalization of variable elimination [20] to mixed
graphs.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
define graph theoretic terminology, describe the identification problem for causal effects, and review the ID
algorithm which solves it. Section 3 gives a recursive
factorization (r-factorization) of distributions with respect to mixed graphs. Section 4 gives a generalized
Möbius parameterization of binary r-factorizing models. In Section 5 we describe our efficient algorithm
for computing interventional distributions. Section 6
contains the discussion and our conclusions.

Notation and Basic Concepts

We first introduce the graph-theoretic terminology we
need to discuss graphical causal models. In this paper,
we will restrict our attention to directed and mixed
graphs. A directed graph consists of a set of nodes and
directed arrows connecting pairs of nodes. A mixed
graph consists of a set of nodes and directed and/or
bidirected arrows (↔) connecting pairs of nodes. A
path is a sequence of distinct nodes where any two
adjacent nodes in the sequence are connected by an
edge. A directed path from a node X to a node Y
is a path consisting of directed edges where all edges
on the path point away from X and towards Y . If a
directed edge points from X to Y then X is called a
parent of Y , and Y a child of X. If X and Y are connected by a bidirected arc, they are called spouses. If
there is a directed path from X to Y then X is an ancestor of Y , and Y a descendant of X; by convention,
X is both an ancestor and a descendant of X. The
sets of parents, children, spouses, ancestors, descendants and non-descendants of a node X are denoted,
P a(X), Ch(X), Sp(X), An(X), De(X) and N d(X),
respectively. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph where for any directed path from X to
Y , Y is not a parent of X. An acyclic directed mixed
graph (ADMG) is a mixed graph which is a DAG if
restricted to directed edges.
A conditional acyclic directed mixed graph (CADMG)
G(V, W, E) is a mixed graph with a vertex set V ∪ W ,
where V ∩W = ∅, subject to the restriction that for all
w ∈ W , P aG (w) = ∅ = SpG (w). In words, a CADMG
is an ADMG with an extra set of nodes W that have
no incoming arrows. Intuitively, a CADMG represents
a conditional distribution P (V | W ). For a graph G,
and a subset of nodes S in G, we denote by G[S] the
CADMG G ∗ (S, P a(S)G \ S, ES ), where ES are those

edges in G that connect nodes in S, or directed edges
in G from a node in P a(S)G \ S to a node in S.
A district S in a CADMG G with vertex set V ∪ W
is any maximal set of nodes in V that are mutually
connected by bidirected paths which are themselves
entirely in S. For a node X, its district in G is denoted by D(X)G . The set of all districts in G forms a
partition of nodes in G and is denoted by D(G). A set
of nodes S ⊆ V in a CADMG G is called bi-directed
connected (↔-connected for short) if it forms a district
in G[S]. For a graph G over V , and vertex set A, the
induced sub-graph GA contains only nodes in A, and
those edges in G which connect nodes in A. A set A is
ancestral in G if for all X ∈ A, An(X)G ⊆ A. The set
of all ancestral sets in G is denoted by A(G).
A consecutive triple of nodes Wi , Wj , Wk on a path is
called a collider if the edge between Wi and Wj and
the edge between Wk and Wj both have arrowheads
pointing to Wj . Any other consecutive triple is called
a non-collider. A path between two nodes X and Y
is said to be blocked by a set Z if either for some noncollider on the path, the middle node is in Z, or for
some collider on the path, no descendant of the middle
node is in Z. For disjoint sets X, Y, Z of nodes in
an ADMG we say X is m-separated from Y given Z
if every path from a node in X to a node in Y is
blocked by Z. If the ADMG is also a DAG, then we
say X is d-separated from Y given Z. If X is not mseparated (or d-separated) from Y given Z, we say X
is m-connected (or d-connected) to Y given Z. See the
graph in Fig. 1 (a) for an illustration of these concepts.
In this graph X1 → X2 → X3 ← X4 is a path from
X1 to X4 ; X1 → X2 → X3 is a directed path from X1
to X3 ; X1 is a parent of X2 , and an ancestor of X3 ;
X2 → X3 ← X4 is a collider; X1 is m-separated from
X4 given X5 ; X1 is m-connected to X4 given X5 and
X3 .

Causal Models and Causal Effects

A Bayesian network model [5] over variables V1 , . . . , Vn
is a joint probability distribution P (v1 , . . Q
. , vn ) and
a DAG G, such that P (v1 , . . . , vn ) =
i P (vi |
P a(Vi )G = pai ), where value assignments pai are con-

sistent with {v1 , . . . , vn }. This decomposition of P
into a product is known as a Markov factorization.
This factorization is equivalent to the local Markov
property which states that each Vi is independent of
{V1 , . . . , Vn } \ (De(Vi )G ∪ P a(Vi )G ) given P a(Vi )G , and
in turn equivalent to the global Markov property defined by d-separation [5], which states, for any disjoint
sets X, Y, Z, that if X is d-separated from Y given Z
in a graph G, then X is independent of Y given Z in
P (v1 , . . . , vn ). The global Markov property for ADMGs is given by m-separation [9].

Note that we use Vi to refer both to a graph vertex and
its associated random variable. In situations where it
is important to distinguish vertices and their variables,
we will use Vi to refer to the vertex, and XVi to refer
to the variable.

there exists a trek (that is a collider-free path) from
Xi to Xj , where all intermediate nodes on the trek are
not in O, and where the first edge has an arrowhead
pointing to Xi , and the last edge has an arrowhead
pointing to Xj .

We use P (y | do(x)) to denote the distribution resulting from an idealized intervention which fixes the value
of X, and called the causal effect of do(x) on Y . The
causal model associated with a DAG asserts that

Latent projections are a convenient way to represent
latent variable models because they simplify the representation of multiple paths of latents while preserving
many useful constraints over observable variables; see
Figure 2 for an example.

p(vj | P a(vj ) = paj );

where v ∗ , x, paj and the vj are consistent (in that the
same values are assigned to the same variables). This
is known as the truncation formula [17],[6], or the gformula [11].
Note that this definition, and hence our resulting theory, is compatible with any of the causal frameworks
currently in the literature (NPSEM, MCM, FFRCISTG, causal BNs, causal IDs).
2.2

Latent Projections, Marginal Causal
Models, and Causal Effect Identification

Causal models with unobserved variables can be represented by a directed acyclic graph with a subset of
nodes labeled as latent. However, another alternative
is to represent such models by ADMGs, containing
only observed variables, where directed arrows represent “direct causation,” and bidirected arrows represent “unspecified causally ancestral latent variables.”
Every DAG with a set of nodes marked latent can
be associated with a ‘latent projection’, which is an
ADMG that preserves path separation relations among
the observable variables [7].
For a DAG G over a variable set V , a latent projection
of G onto O ⊆ V is an ADMG G(O), over nodes O,
where Xi , Xj ∈ O have an edge Xi → Xj if there
exists a directed path Xi → L1 → · · · → Lk → Xj
where L1 , . . . Lk 6∈ O, and have an edge Xi ↔ Xj if

Consider an ADMG G induced by some latent variable
causal model, and disjoint sets X, Y of nodes in this
G. Is it possible to characterize situations when the
causal effect of do(x) on Y is identifiable in any model
inducing G? It turns out that the answer is yes, and
there is an explicit, closed-form algorithm for deriving the functional for such a causal effect whenever it
is identifiable. This algorithm was first developed in
[19], for causal Bayesian networks and semi-Markovian
models. A version of this algorithm, called ID, which
appears in [15] is shown in Fig. 3.
The ID algorithm is recursive, using simplification
methods, based on districts and ancestral sets. First,
the algorithm eliminates any irrelevant variables by intervening on them with arbitrary values (line 3). Second, the algorithm splits the problem into subproblems based on districts (line 4). Third, the algorithm
marginalizes out some variables such that the margin
that is left is an ancestral set in the graph resulting
from interventions (line 2). And finally, the algorithm
“truncates out” some variables in situations where the
DAG truncation formula applies to a particular intervention (lines 6 and 7). When the algorithm fails (line
5), it returns a witness for this failure, called a ‘hedge’:
Definition 1 (c-forest) Let R be a subset of nodes
in an ADMG G. Then a set F is called an R-rooted
C-forest if R ⊆ F , F is a ↔-connected set, and every
node in F has a directed path to a node in R with every
element on the path also in F .

in an ADMG G. Then two R-rooted C-forests F, F ′

An(Y )G[V \X] , and X ⊂ F ′ \ F .
Hedges characterize non-identification of causal effects
due to the following theorem [15].
Theorem 1 P (y | do(x)) is identifiable in any semiMarkovian model inducing an ADMG G if and only if
there is no hedge for any (X ′ , Y ′ ) in G, where X ′ ⊆
X, Y ′ ⊆ Y , and X ′ is non-empty.

where x̃2 and x̃1 are arbitrary values. This functional
involves the term P (x5 | x4 , x′3 , x̃2 , x′1 ), which in binary models corresponds to 32 numbers. As mixed
graphs increase in size, the size of conditional probability tables necessary to evaluate causal effect functionals quickly becomes intractable. In DAG models, inference algorithms based on the factorization systematically exploit conditional independence constraints
implied by this factorization to make inference computationally tractable. To extend this approach to mixed
graphs, we introduce a recursive factorization.

Recursive Factorization of ADMGs

The recursive factorization is defined in terms of special sets of nodes called ‘intrinsic’ sets, which are
closely related to certain identifiable causal effects,
though the notion of an intrinsic set is purely graphical.
Definition 3 Let G be an ADMG. Then a set of nodes
S in G is intrinsic if it is ↔-connected and there does
not exist a hedge for (P a(S) \ S, S) in G.
An alternative but equivalent definition of intrinsic
sets exists, which does not involve concepts from identification.
Definition 4 Let S be a ↔-connected set in an
ADMG G. Define the following operations on subgraphs of G:
G

7→ GAnG (S) ,
7→ GDG (S) ,

The simplest graph where causal effect identification
is not possible is shown in Fig. 1(b). In this graph, the
hedge witnessing non-identifiability of P (y | do(x)) is
the two sets {Y }, and {X, Y }. Mapping to the definition, R = {Y }, F = {Y }, F ′ = {X, Y }.
2.3

Evaluating Causal Effect Functionals

Consider the graph shown in Fig. 7(a), where we wish
to use ID to evaluate the causal effect of do(x3 ) on
X5 , or P (x5 | do(x3 )). Applying ID to this task yields
the following identity:

(k)

Then S is intrinsic in G if (∃k > 0), GS = γS (G).
We will denote the set of all intrinsic sets in G by I(G).
Every ↔-connected set S in G is contained in a unique
smallest member of I(G), called the intrinsic closure
of S.
Our factorization is recursive, and thus is defined on
CADMGs, in which the set W may be thought of as
representing ‘pre-existing interventions’.

Note that this factorization can be viewed as a refinement of the factorization in [8] which only represented
conditional independence constraints (corresponding
to m-separations), whereas the criterion here also represents conditional independences after division by a
conditional density. If such a division can be causally
interpreted as an intervention, such independences are
called dormant in [16].

4.2

We now show how to partition an arbitrary subset of
V in a CADMG G(V, W, E) into elements of RH(G).
Definition 8 Let ≺I(G) be a partial order on heads
of intrinsic sets of G such that H1 ≺I(G) H2 if H1 =
rh(C1 ), H2 = rh(C2 ), C1 , C2 ∈ I(G), C1 ⊆ C2
For a set of heads H, let max≺I(G) (H) be the subset
of H containing heads maximal in H under ≺I(G) .
Definition 9 For any B ⊆ V of nodes in a CADMG
G(V, W, E), define the following functions:
ΥG (B) ≡ max≺I(G) (RH(G) ∩ P(B))

We now show that the observed marginals of causal
DAG models r-factorize.
Theorem 2 Let P (O) be the observed marginal of a
causal DAG, with latent projection given by an ADMG
G. Then there exists FG such that P (O) r-factorizes
according to G and FG .
Proof: Let FG = {P (c | do(P a(C) \ C = pa)) | C ∈
I(G), pa assignments to P a(C) \ C}. The theorem follows by soundness of the ID algorithm.

ρG (B) ≡ B \

We now give a parameterization of r-factorizing binary
models. The approach generalizes in a straightforward
way to finite discrete state spaces.
4.1

Heads of intrinsic sets

To parameterize our models, we will associate a set of
parameters with each intrinsic set, just as binary DAG
models associate parameters of the form P (Xi = 0 |
P a(Xi ) = pai ) with each node Xi . We first define sets
of nodes, called ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ related to a given
set C ∈ I(G) that will serve the role of Xi and P a(Xi ),
respectively, in the DAG case.
Definition 6 For an intrinsic set C ∈ I(G) of a
CADMG G, define the recursive head (rh) as: rh(C) ≡
{x | x ∈ C; chGC (x) = ∅}. Let RH(G) ≡ {rh(C) | C ∈
I(G)}.
Definition 7 The tail associated with a recursive
head H of an intrinsic set C in a CADMG G is given
by: tail(H) ≡ (C \ H) ∪ paG (C)

Binary Parameterization

Multivariate binary distributions which r-factorize
with respect to a CADMG G may be parameterized
by the following parameters:
Definition 10 The binary parameters associated with
CADMG G are a set of functions QG :
n
o
qH (xtail(H) ) | H ∈ RH(G), qH : {0, 1}|tail(H)| → [0, 1]
Intuitively the functions qH (xtail(H) ) should be
thought of as giving the value fC (XH = 0 | Xtail(H) =
xtail(H) ), where H = rhG (C). We emphasize that the
density fC is not necessarily a standard conditional
density in P . Instead in any causal model where the
g-formula holds, fC (XH = 0 | Xtail(H) = xtail(H) ) can
be interpreted as a conditional interventional distribution P (XH = 0 | XC\H = xC\H , do(XP a(C)\C =
xP a(C)\C )), where H = rh(C).
Definition 11 Let ν : V ∪ W 7→ {0, 1} be an assignment of values to the variables indexed by V ∪ W .
Define ν(T ) to be the values assigned to variables indexed by a subset T ⊆ V ∪ W . Let ν −1 (0) = {v | v ∈
V, ν(v) = 0}.

function EID(y, x, Q(V ), G(V ))
INPUT: x, y value assignments, Q(V ) a set of parameters representing a distribution P (v) which r-factorizes
with respect to G, G an ADMG.
OUTPUT: A set of q parameters representing Px (y),
or FAIL.
1 Let V ∗ = An(Y )G[V \X] \ X, Q∗ = Q(V ∗ | x),
G ∗ = G[V ∗ ].
2 If I(G[V ∗ ]) 6⊆ I(G(V )), return FAIL.
3 Pick an elimination order V1 , . . . , Vk for V ∗ \ Y .
4 For each i = 1, . . . , k, do:
(Q∗ , G ∗ ) ← sum-one(Vi , Q∗ , G ∗ ).
5 return Q∗

2, our algorithm applies to any graphical causal model
where the g-formula holds. The algorithm is shown in
Figs. 4 and 5.
The algorithm returns a q representation of an identifiable query P (y | do(x)) in two stages. In the first
stage, the algorithm computes a q representation of
the distribution P (An(y)G([V \X]) \ X | do(x)) from a
q representation of P (v1 , . . . , vn ), denoted by Q(V ).
As we will show in the next section, a representation of this marginal interventional can be computed
in one step, by restricting the set Q(V ) to those parameters qH (tail(H)) with H ⊆ RH(G) ∩ V ∗ , where
V ∗ = An(Y )G[V \X] \X, and with tail assignments consistent with x. In the algorithm, this restriction is
denoted by Q(V ∗ | x).

Figure 4: An efficient algorithm for computing
marginal interventional distributions.

The second stage marginalizes out variables not in Y
from P (An(y)G([V \X]) \ X | do(x)) using a particular
elimination order. Marginalizing a single variable X is
done by converting from a q representation to a standard probability representation, marginalizing X from
the table, and converting back to a q representation.

A distribution P (XV | XW ) is said to be parameterized by the set QG , for CADMG G if:
X
−1
(−1)|B\ν (0)|
p(XV = ν(V ) | XW = ν(W )) =

In the remainder of the section, we are going to show
that the algorithm is sound (i.e.. performs probabilistic calculations correctly), and then analyze its time
and space complexity.

where the empty product is defined to be 1.
Note that this parameterization maps qH parameters
to probabilities in a CADMG via an inverse Möbius
transform. Note also that this parameterization generalizes both the standard Markov parameterization
of DAGs in terms of parameters of the form p(Xi =
0 | P a(xi ) = pai ), and the Möbius parameterization
of bidirected graph models given in [2]. We will denote the generalized Möbius transform which maps
a set Q(V ) = {qH (tail(H)) ∈ QG | H ⊆ V }, to
a distribution P (XV = ν(V ) | XW = ν(W )) as
GMT(G(V ), Q(V ), ν). In a companion paper [10] we
show that a multivariate binary distribution P is parameterized by Q(V ) if and only if P r-factorizes according to G. We will call the set of q parameters representing a (possibly conditional) distribution P the q
representation of P .

An Efficient Algorithm for
Computing Interventional
Marginals

In this section, we describe our inference algorithm for
computing causal effect marginals. Due to Theorem

To show soundness of EID, we will first show that
the set of unintervened nodes in the post-intervention
world considered by ID before the final marginalization step in lines 1, 4, or 6 consists precisely of nodes
in An(Y )G[V \X] \ X. Next, we show that the distribution corresponding to that post-intervention world can
be computed by restricting the set of parameters onto
the set of nodes in that world. Finally, we show the
soundness of the last marginalization step by showing
sum-one is sound.
Lemma 1 For a given query (y, x, P (v), G(V )), line
4 of ID is invoked at most once.
Proof: If line 4 is invoked, all subproblems contain
outcome sets which form a ↔-connected set. Since no
recursive call of ID considers subsets of such outcome
sets, line 4 is never invoked on any subproblem.
¤
For any recursive call ID, let V ∗ be the set of nodes
in the ADMG G ∗ passed to that recursive call’s scope.
Lemma 2 If ID is invoked with (y, x, P (v), G(V )),
and terminates successfully, then in the terminating line ID evaluates an expression corresponding to

function sum-one(X, Q(V ), G(V ))

with respect to G(V ), G(V ) an ADMG.

ν(H) = 0, ν(T ) = t, order ν in ascending
order of cardinality of 1 assignments in ν,
evaluate

P Q

Finally, we are ready to prove that the first stage of
EID is sound.
Lemma 5 If P (y | do(x)) is identifiable in G(V ),
and P (v) r-factorizes according to G(V ), then
P (An(y)G[V \X] \ X | do(x)) is identifiable in G(V ),
and is parameterized by Q(An(Y )G[V \X] \ X | x) in
G[An(Y )G[V \X] \ X].
Proof: The distribution operations in ID corresponding to lines 2 and 7 are ancestral marginalizations and
interventions on all nodes outside a districts. Since
the q parameters are fully determined by the distributions P (XC | Xtail(C) ), the previous three lemmas
imply our result.
¤

To prove the soundness of stage two, we have two
cases. If I ∈ I(G(V \ {X})) and X 6∈ P a(I)G(V ) , then
I ∈ I(G(V )). Further, by Lemma 3, the q parameters
GMT(G(V )[D],Q(D),ν)

Proof: Successful termination occurs in lines 1, 4,
and 6. An(Y )G[V \X] \ X ⊆ V ∗ \ X is established by
function call induction. Certainly An(Y )G[V \X] ∩ ⊆
V \ X, where V is the set of all nodes in the outermost call. The only lines which remove nodes are
2 and 7. We have two cases. If line 4 is never
called, then in line 2, by inductive hypothesis, G ∗
is a supergraph of G[An(Y )G[V \X] \ X]. This means
An(Y )G[V \X] \ X ⊆ An(Y )G ∗ . In line 7, only a subset of nodes in X, say X ∗ , is removed. By inductive hypothesis, An(Y )G[V \X] \ X ⊆ V \ X ∗ . If line
4 is called, it is only once due to Lemma 1. We have
An(Y )G[V \X] \ X ⊆ V ∗ \ X, by induction. Finally,
G ∗ [V ∗ \ X] is a subgraph of G[V \ X], so any set ancestral in G[V \ X] is also ancestral in G ∗ [V ∗ \ X]. But
we know An(Y )G[V \X] is ancestral in G[V \ X].

Lemma 6 If I ∈ I(G(V \ {X})) and X ∈ P a(I)G(V ) ,
then ∀D ∈ D(G[I ∪ {X}]), D ∈ I(G(V )).
Proof: By construction, each such D is ↔-connected.
We want to show the distribution P (i∪{x} | do(P a(I ∪
{X})G(V ) \ (I ∪ {X}) = pai )) is identifiable in G(V ).
Once we do so, our conclusion will follow, since for each
D, P (d | do(P a(D)G \ D = pad )) is identifiable from
P (I ∪ {X} | do(P a(I ∪ {X})G(V ) \ (I ∪ {X}) = pai )).
Assume for contradiction P (i ∪ {x} | do(P a(I ∪
{X})G(V ) \ (I ∪ {X}) = pai )) is not identifiable in
G(V ). Then there exists a hedge for (P a(I ∪ {X}) \
(I ∪ {X}), I ∪ {X}) in G(V ). Let R be the subset of
I ∪ {X} with no children in G[I ∪ {X}]. By definition,
there exists a hedge for (P a(I ∪ {X}) \ (I ∪ {X}), R).
If any vertex Z in I has X as a child in G[I ∪ {X}],
then it will have a child in G[I], hence gets nothing
added to R in G(V \ {X}). Note also that the sets
P a(I ∪ {X})G(V ) \ (I ∪ {X}), and P a(I)G(V \{X}) \ I
are the same. Finally, since X contains a child C in I,
any C-forest F in G(V ) either remain in G(V \ {X}),
if F does not intersect X, or an isomorphic C-forest
F ′ exists in G(V \ {X}), where X is replaced by C.
This implies a contradiction, since we just showed the
existence of a hedge for (P a(I)G(V \{X}) \ I, I), but we
assumed I ∈ I(G(V \ {X})).

Mixed Graph Binary Width

We now introduce a certain measure of graph “width,”
which is derived from the dimension of the model. We

will show that the computational complexity of EID is
exponential in this measure. This width can be viewed
as a tally of those parameters which we compute by
invoking GMT, for a particular elimination order.
Definition 12 For an ADMG G(V ) and a node X ∈
V , let Hx = {rh(I) | I ∈ I(G(V \ {X})), X ∈
P a(I)G(V ) }. The binary width of G(V ) with respect to
P
X, or bw(G(V ), X) is equal to log2 H∈Hx 2|tail(H)| .
Definition 13 For an elimination order π indexing
nodes Z1 , . . . , Zk in a set Z ⊂ V in G(V ), the binary width of G(V ) using π with respect to Z is
bwπ (G(V ), Z) = maxi bw(G(V \ Z, Zi , . . . , Zk ), Zi ).
The binary width of G(V ) with respect to a set Z ⊆ V ,
written as bw(G(V ), Z) is the smallest binary width
across all elimination orderings of nodes in Z.
Note that considering an interventional query P (y |
do(x)) will often reduce the width, since evaluating
such a query entails considering the mutilated graph
G[An(Y )G[V \X] \ X] which often has fewer edges, and
always has fewer parameters than G(V ).
5.3

Complexity Analysis

We now give the complexity analysis of EID. We will
consider a fixed query (y, x, Q(V ), G(V )), for which we
let V ∗ = An(Y )G[V \X] \ X. The original graph G(V )
will be assumed to have n nodes and m edges, while
the graph G[V ∗ ] will be assumed to have n∗ nodes.
Lemma 7 Evaluating line 1 of EID has time complexity O(n + m + |Q(V ∗ | x)|).
Lemma 8 Evaluating line 2 of EID has time complexity O(|I(G)| · n2 · (n + m)).
Proof: Finding ancestors of a set can be done using
an O(n) traversal, which is done possibly O(n) times.
Finding a smaller district containing the outcome is
equivalent to the problem of updating connected sets
in undirected graphs when edges are deleted one by
one. An algorithm for this problem exists with time
complexity O(q + n · m), where q is the number of
edge deletions [13]. This implies finding the intrinsic
closure of any ↔-connected S can be done in time
O(n · (n + m)). It can be shown (we omit the proof
for space reasons) that all elements in I(G) can be
obtained from the set of closures of singleton nodes
in G by successively taking unions and closures. This
implies the overall complexity stated.
¤
Let b = bwπ (G[V ∗ ], V ∗ \ Y ), for some order π which
we assume EID is using.
Lemma 9 For each latent projection Gi obtained by
eliminating the first i nodes in V ∗ \ Y in order π from

G[V ∗ ], computing the set I(Gi ) has time complexity
O(|I(Gi )| · n2i · (ni + mi )), where ni is the number of
nodes in Gi and mi is the number of edges in Gi .
Lemma 10 Line 3 of sum-one has time complexity
O(4b ).
Proof: Given that we know the heads and tails of
all parameters in G(V \ X), we can tell in O(1) time
whether a given parameter must be computed via line
3. The number of assignments ν is bounded by 2b , by
definition. For each such assignment, we call GMT
on each district in the partition of I ∪ {X}, which is
equivalent to calling GMT on the entire set. But this
is exponential in the number of nodes assigned 1, and
so is bounded by 2b .
¤
Lemma 11 Line 4 of sum-one has time complexity
O(n∗ · 2b ).
Proof: For each element in Q(V ), we must perform
a constant amount of work to determine whether the
parameter stays unchanged or was computed via line
3. But |Q(V )| has size at most O(n∗ · 2b ).
¤
Noting that ni + mi is bounded by n + m, and |I(Gi )|
is bounded by n∗ · 2b , we put our results together to
give the overall complexity of EID.
Theorem 3 EID has time complexity O(n + m +
|Q(V ∗ | x)| + (n∗ − |Y |) · (4b + 2b · n∗ · n2 · (n + m))).
We emphasize that our analysis of graph operations of
EID is somewhat coarse, and the complexity of these
operations may potentially be improved. We believe
a more careful analysis would render the paper more
complex for little return, since the main computational
roadblock in practice is the exponential dependence
on width. An even coarser grained expression for the
complexity of EID is O(poly(n) · 4b ), where poly(n) is
some low order polynomial over n.
5.4

A Dynamic Programming Scheme for
GMT

A Möbius transform [4] on a distribution over n variables has time complexity O(4n ). A dynamic programming algorithm exists which is capable of implementing the transform with time complexity O(n · 2n ).
This algorithm is known as the Fast Möbius Transform
[4]. We develop a similar scheme for our generalized
Möbius transform. It is shown in Fig. 6.
Theorem 4 If every input to FGMT in the course of
evaluating P (XV | XW ) is memoized (cached on evaluation), and assignments µ are processed in ascending
order of cardinality of 1 assignments in µ, then the

time and space complexity of using FGMT to evaluate P (XV | XW ) is O(|V ∪ W | · 2|V ∪W | ).
Corollary 1 If memoized FGMT is used instead of
GMT in line 3b of sum-one, then the time complexity of EID is O(n + m + |Q(V ∗ | x)| + (n∗ − |Y |) · (b ·
2b + 2b · n∗ · n2 · (n + m))).

function FGMT(G, Q, µ)
INPUT: G a CADMG, Q a set of qH (XH = 0 | xT ),

OUTPUT: The probability p(XV = µV | XW = µW ).
Let ≺ be a topological ordering on V ∪ W .
0. If G is the empty graph, return 1.

A coarser expression for the overall complexity of EID
is then O(poly(n) · b · 2b ), where poly(n) is a low order
polynomial over n.

FGMT(G[D], Q(D | µP a(D)\D ), µD∪P a(D) ) on
each district D ∈ D(G); return the product of
the results.

2. If D(G) = {D} then find H = rh(D);

An Example

We illustrate the operation of the algorithm with an
example. Consider the mixed graph in Fig. 7(a),
parameterized by: qx1 , qx2 (x1 ), qx1 ,x3 (x2 ), qx3 (x2 ),
qx2 ,x4 (x1 , x3 ), qx4 (x3 ), qx5 ,x3 ,x1 (x2 , x4 ), qx5 ,x3 (x2 , x4 ),
qx5 (x4 ), for a total of 23 parameters. A more naive
representation of the distribution P (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )
(including the parameterization in [8]) would contain 31 parameters.
We wish to evaluate the
query P (x5 | do(x3 )). According to EID, V ∗ =
An(X5 )G[X1 ,X2 ,X4 ,X5 ] \ {X3 }, which means the relevant parameter restriction computed in the first
stage is Q(X5 , X4 | x3 ), which is equal to {qx5 (x4 ),
qx4 (x3 )}. In the second stage, EID marginalizes out
all nodes not in the outcome X5 from this representation, which just entails marginalizing out X4 . This is
done using sum-one, which uses GMT to compute
P (x5 | do(x
P4 )) and P (x4 | do(x3 )), computes P (x5 |
do(x3 )) = x4 P (x5 | do(x4 ))P (x4 | do(x3 )), and converts back to a q representation of P (x5 | do(x3 )),
which corresponds to the graph shown in Fig. 7(c).
Note that using q parameters allows us to compute
precisely the effect expression in Section 2.3 without
resorting to 32 conditional probabilities.
Note that the same running time will hold for evaluating the query P (xk | do(xk−2 )) for any extension of
the graph in Fig. 7(a) to k nodes. This is in contrast
to the original formulation of the ID algorithm, which
will involve probability tables of size exponential in k.

Discussion

We have given an algorithm (EID) which can compute
interventional marginal distributions in latent variable
causal models. Our algorithm achieves some measure
of computational efficiency by exploiting conditional
and post-truncation independence constraints embedded in r-factorization. In the special case of no interventions, our algorithm can be viewed as an efficient inference scheme for graphical models of conditional independence containing latent variables. Given
a maximum likelihood estimator for q parameters of

× qH (µtail(H) ).

input is memoized (cached).

r-factorizing models, our algorithm can be viewed as
giving an MLE for causal effects in such models.
Going beyond binary models, EID can be viewed as
generalizing the g-formula for identifiable causal effects
to mixed graph models,
by noting that in such models,
P
P (y | do(x)) = v∗ \y P ∗ (V ∗ ), where V ∗ are observable ancestors of Y in the graph after do(x) was performed, and P ∗ is a distribution obtained from P (V )
by “truncating out” all (r)-factors containing X.
We hasten to add that r-factorizing models are inherently conservative, in the sense that they make no
assumptions about the latent variables. A statistical
model which makes additional modeling assumptions
on the latents is capable of more efficient parameterizations and algorithms. Consider a DAG model shown
in Fig. 2(a), where nodes {X1 , X2 , . . . } are latent, and
all nodes are binary. This model is parameterized by
P (x1 = 0), P (y1 = 0 | x1 ), and P (yi = 0 | xi−1 , xi ),
P (xi = 0), for i > 1. Since all nodes are binary, the total number of parameters grows linearly with the total
number of nodes in this model.

{Y1 , Y2 , . . . } is shown in Fig. 2(b). It is not difficult
to show that the number of q parameters in graphs
of the type shown in Fig. 2(b) grows as O(k 2 ) for a
graph with k nodes. The DAG model with latents in
Fig. 2(a) posits additional assumptions about the latent variables beyond those implied by the conditional
independence structure of its graph, namely that the
number of states of the latent variables Xi does not
depend on the total number of such variables. On the
other hand, if we are not willing to commit to any
assumptions about latent variables, and only wish to
assume conditional and post-truncation independences
implied by a particular mixed graph, we believe using
r-factorization is in some sense “optimal.”
Our algorithm can be used to obtain identifiable conditional interventional distributions of the form P (y |
z, do(x)). A known result [14] implies identification
problems for such distributions are always equivalent
to identification problems for an unconditional effect
of the form P (y ′ | do(x′ )), where P (y | z, do(x)) =
P (y ′ | do(x′ ))/P (z ′ | do(x′ )), for some Z ′ ⊆ Y ′ . This
result means, we can use our algorithm to obtain q
parameters for P (y ′ | do(x′ )), and obtain our answer
by one final conditioning operation.
