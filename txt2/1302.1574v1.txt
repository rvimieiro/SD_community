BAYESIAN NETWORKS

A Bayesian network (BN) is an annotated directed
acyclic graph, where each node represents a random
variable and is attached with

a

conditional probabil­

ity of the node given its parents. In addition to the
explicitly represented conditional probabilities, a BN
also implicitly represents conditional independence as-

sertions. Let x1, x2,
, Xn be an enumeration of all
the nodes in a BN such that each node appears before
its children, and let rrz, be the set of parents of a node
x,. The following assertions are implicitly represented:

The conditional independence assertions and the con­
ditional probabilities t ogether entail a joint proba bility
over all the variables. As a matter of fact, by the chain
rule, we have

where the second equation is true because of the con­
ditional independence assertions and the conditional
probabilities P(x;l'lr:r:,) are given in the specification of
the BN. Consequently, one can, in theory, do arbitrary
probabilistic reasoning in a BN.

Bayesian networks place no restriction on how a node
depends on its parents. Unfortunately this means that
in the most general case we need to specify an expo­
nential (in the number of parents) number of condi­
tional probabilities for each node. There are many
cases where there is structure in the probability ta­
bles. One such case that we investigate in this paper
is known as independence of causal influence (ICI).
The concept of ICI was first introduced by Heckerma.n
[4]. The following definition first appeared in Zhang
and Poole [24].
In one interpretation, arcs in a BN represent causal
relationships; the parents c1, c2, . .. , Cm of a node e
are viewed as causes that jointly bear on the effect e.
,
ICI refers to the situation where the causes c1o c2
and Cm contribute independently to the effect e. In
other words, the ways by which the c;'s influence e are
independent.
•

• •

More precisely, Ct, c2
, and Cm are said to influence
e independently if there exist random variables �1, �2
... , and �m that have the same frame- set of possible
values - as e such that

C;

and

There exists a commutative and associative bi­
nary op erato r * over the frame of e such that
e == el *6* ... *�m·

We shall refer to ei as the co ntrib ution of e; to e. In less
technical terms, causes influence their common effect
independently if individual contributions from differ­
ent causes are independent and the total influence is a
combination of the individual contributions.
We call the variable e a convergent variable for it
is where independent contributions from different
sources are collected and combined (and for the lack of
a better name). Non-convergent variables will simply
be called regular variables. We also call * the base com­
bination operator of e. Different convergent variables
can have difference base combination operators.
The reader is referred to [24] for more detailed expla­
nations and examples of ICI.
The conditional probability table P(elct, . .. , em ) of a
convergent variable e can be factorized into smaller
pieces. To be more specific, let /; (e, e;) be the function
defined by

fi(e= a, e;) = P(ei=aie;),

to deal with in order to take advantage of conditional
probability table factorizations induced by

To alleviate the problem, we introduce the concept of
deputation. It was originally defined in term of BNs
[24]. In this paper, we define it in terms of heteroge­

neous factorizations themselves.

The joint probability can be obtained by multiply­

called old regular variables.

clique tree construction, clique tree initialization, ev­

Theorem 1 Let :F be the heterogeneous factorization
represented by a BN and let :F' be the list of factors
obtained from :F by deputing all convergent variables.
Then :F' is a ®-homogeneous factorization of the joint
probability entailed by the BN.
All proofs are omitted due to space limit. Since the
operator ® is commetative and associative, the theo­
rem states that factors can be combined in arbitrary
order after deputation.

A clique is simply a subset of nodes.

A clique tree

is a tree of cliques such that if a node appear in two
different cliques then it appears in all cliques on the
path between those two cliques.
A clique tree for a BN is constructed in two steps: first
obtain an undirected graph and then build a clique tree
for the undirected graph. CTPI and CTP differ only
in the first step. CTP obtains an undirected graph
by marrying the parents of each node (i.e. by adding
edges between the parents so that they are pairwise
connected) and then drop directions on all arcs. The
resulting undirected graph is called a moral graph of
the BN.

SUMMING OUT VARJABLES

Summing out a variable from a factorization is a funda­
mental operation in many inference algorithms. This
section shows how to sum out a variable from a ®­
homogeneous factorization of a joint potential.
Let

:F be a ®-homogeneous factorization of a joint po­

In CTPI, only the parents of regular nodes (represent­
ing old regular variables) are married. The parents of
convergent nodes (representing new regular variables)
are not married. The clique tree constructed in CTPI
has the following properties: (1) for any regular node
there is a clique that contain the node as well as all its
parents and (2) for any convergent node e and each of

tential P(x1, x2, . . , xn). Consider the following pro­

On the other hand, if all variables that appear in one
factor f in the list also appear in another factor g in

such combinations. Thereafter, we keep the reduced

Since clique tree construction and initialization need
to be carried out only once for each network, we shall
not compare in detail the complexities of algorithms
in those two steps, except saying that they do not dif­
fer significantly. Computing posterior probabilities af­
ter propagation requires very little resources compared
to propagation. We shall concentrate on propagation
time.
In standard CTP, incoming messages of a clique are

combined in the propagation module after message
passing. In CTPI , on the other hand, incoming mes­
sages are not combined in the propagation module.
For fairness of comparison, the version of CTP we
implemented postpones the combination of incoming
messages to the module for computing posterior prob­
abilities.
Let us define a case to consist of a list of observed vari­
ables and their observed values. Propagation time and
memory consumption varies from case to case. In the
first three networks, the algorithms were tested using
150 randomly generated cases consisting of 5, 10, or
15 observed variables. In the fourth network, only 15
cases were used due to time constraints. Propagation
times and maximum memory consumptions across the
cases were averaged. The statistics are in Figure 3,
where the Y-axises are in logscale. All data were col­
lected using a SPARC20.

The CPCS networks [19] are used in the comparisons.
They are a good testbed for algorithms that exploits
ICI since all non-root nodes are convergent. The net­
works vary in the number of nodes, and the average
number of parents of a node, and the average number
of possible values of a node (variable). Their specifi­
cations are given in the following table.

Figure 3: Average space and time complexities of CTP,
PD&CTP, TT&CTP, and CTPI on the CPCS net­
works.
We see that CTPI is faster than all other algorithms
and it uses much less memory. In network 4, for in­
stance, CTPI is about 5 faster than CTP, 3 times faster
than TT&CTP, a.nd 3.5 times faster than PD&CTP.
On average it requires 7MB memory, while CTP re­
quires 15MB, TT&CTP requires 22MB, and PD&CTP
require 17MB.
The networks used in our experiments are quite sim­
ple in the sense that the nodes have a average number
of less than 1.5 parents. As a consequence, gains due
to exploitation of ICI and the differences among the
different ways of exploiting ICI are not very signifi­
cant. Zhang and Poole [24] have reported experiments
on more complex versions of the CPCS networks with
combinations of the VE algorithm and methods for ex­
ploiting ICI. Gains due to exploitation of ICI and the
differences among the different ways of exploiting ICI
are much larger. Unfortunately, none of the combina­
tions of CTP and methods for exploiting ICI was able
to deal with those more complex network; they all ran
out memory when initializing clique trees.
The method of exploiting ICI described in this paper
is more efficient than previous method because it di-

CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed to method for

exploiting

ICI

in

CTP. The method has been empirically shown to

be more efficient than the combination of CTP and
the network simplification methods for exploiting ICI.
Theoretical underpinnings for the method have their
roots in Zhang and Poole

[24]

and are significantly

simplified due a deeper u nderstanding of ICI.
