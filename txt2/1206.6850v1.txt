visually inspecting the store’s contents. Such browsing is
not easy on-line. Amazon.com, for instance, has thousands
of items in many categories. While collaborative filtering
allows an on-line seller to recommend a list of objects that
the buyer might also like, it does not supply a good way of
browsing an on-line collection in a more free-form fashion.
We propose building an embedded graph of all the items
using the collaborative rating data, and allowing the shopper to zoom in on a portion of the graph and scroll around
as he or she searches for items of interest. If constructed
well, nearby items will also be of interest to the shopper
and local directions in the space will have “meaning” to
the user. Spatial layouts have been shown in the past to
increase interest in exploration and to aid in finding information (Chennawasin et al., 1999).
We assume a D-dimensional Euclidean space, which we
call the embedded space (for most computer interfaces,
D = 2). Each user or item is represented by a point in
this space. Intuitively, if two user (or item) points are near
each other in the embedded space, the two users (items) are
likely to have similar preferences (properties). In the same
manner, the closer a user point is to an item point in the
embedded space, the higher the rating the user has given
(or would give) the item.
We formulate the visualization problem in Section 2, and
then propose with our approach in Section 3. In Section 4
we show our results on three real-world datasets.
1.1

Prior Work

There are many existing collaborative filtering algorithms
focusing on the task of prediction. We cannot review all
of them and they do not directly pertain to the task of visualization. Breese et al. (1998) classifies the approaches
into two major categories: memory based and model based.
Memory based collaborative filtering algorithms make pre-

dictions according to all the existing preferences stored beforehand, while model based algorithms first try to learn the
parameters of a particular model for the existing user preferences, and then make predictions according to the learned
model. Our work is mostly a model based approach.
Some of the filtering methods have a “geometric” flavor.
Pennock et al. (2000) propose a collaborative filter based
on personality diagnosis. They associate each user with
a vector Rtrue , indicating the true rating of this user for
every item in the system. The actual rating is assumed to
be a random variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with mean equals to the corresponding element of that item
in the user’s Rtrue vector. If there is a missing rating, the
corresponding Rtrue element is a uniform random variable.
Goldberg et al. (2001) propose Eigentaste (ET). It has two
phases: offline and online. It treats the entire rating matrix
as a high dimensional space and employs principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction during the offline phase. It projects the users into a low dimensional
space and then partitions the embedded space into sets of
users and uses the maximally rated items in a given set as
predictions during the online phase. While this algorithm
does place the users in a geometric space, it does not place
the items in the same space, and it requires that there be a
set of items (the gauge set) which every user has rated.
Saul and Roweis (2003) propose locally linear embedding
(LLE) as an algorithm for embedding points into a (low
dimensional) space. It is not geared to collaborative data: it
does not deal well with sparse data, and it can only embed
either users or items. However, it has had good success
with non-linear embeddings, so it is a candidate method
for the collaborative visualization problem.
Co-occurrence data have been used to produce embeddings
of two classes of objects in the same space. CODE (Globerson et al., 2005) is one such recent example. It tries to
embed objects of two types into the same Euclidean space
based on their co-occurrence statistics. Unfortunately, collaborative filtering data are usually given as ratings and
not co-occurrence statistics. Even if we take the ratings
to be proportional to the corresponding co-occurrences (an
unjustified assumption), we still have missing statistics
(which cannot be taken to be zero). Co-occurrence algorithms do not currently deal with such missing values.
None of the above three algorithms (ET, LLE and CODE)
was developed for our task. However, there are no other
algorithms designed for collaborative visualization. Therefore, we compare to them (to the extent possible) in Section 4.

2

The Visualization Problem

We first introduce our notations in 2.1. In 2.2 we formulate
the visualization problem of collaborative data. We specify

our distributional assumptions in 2.3.
2.1

Notation

Let U = {u1 , u2 , . . . , um } and G = {g1 , g2 , . . . , gn } be
the sets of all users and items, respectively. Without ambiguity, we will use ui to refer both to the i-th user and to the
corresponding point in the embedded space for that user.
We use the same notation for gj . We define δij to be 1 if ui
rated gj and 0 otherwise.
Let rij be the rating of ui of gj if δij = 1. Here we normalize all the ratings to the range [0, 1] (i.e. 1 is the highest
rating, and 0 is the lowest). Let R = {rij | δij = 1}.
We further denote Gi = {gj | δij = 1} and U j = {ui |
δij = 1}. Gi is the set of all the items that ui rated, and U j
is the set of all the users that rated gj .
2.2

Formulation of the Problem

The visualization problem is to find an embedding of all the
points U and G in a Euclidean space we call the embedded
space. The embedding should be one in which the distance
between a user and an item is related to the corresponding
rating.
In the embedded space, we assume each ui and gj are
random variables drawn independently from prior distributions Pu (ui ) and Pg (gj ). We introduce a rating function
f : <+
0 7→ [0, 1], which maps the distance between two
points (a user and an item) in the embedded space to a real
value on [0, 1]: the expected rating for the two points. f (x)
is a monotonically non-increasing function, f (0) = 1, and
f (∞) = 0. Intuitively, two points with a smaller mutual
distance should have a higher expected rating. At this point,
we will assume that the rating function f (x) is given. In
Section 3.4 we will show how this function can be learned
from data. The actual rating rij between two points ui and
gj in the embedded space is a random variable drawn from
a distribution Pf (rij | ui , gj ) with mean f (kui − gj k).
Given all the ratings, R, as evidence and the rating function,
f , our task is to put all the user points U and item points G
into the embedded space so that the likelihood of observed
ratings R is maximized. That is, we want to find the U and
G points that maximize the posterior:
[U ∗ , G∗ ] = arg max P (U, G | R)

P (U, G, R) is a real-valued Bayesian network in which
each user and item variable has no parents and each rating
variable has two parents (one user and one item). The ratings are given as evidence and the task is to determine the

most probable joint assignment to the user and item variables given the ratings.
2.3

Pu = N (0, Σu )
Pg = N (0, Σg )
Pf (rij |ui , gj ) = N (f (kui − gj k), σr ) .
Note that while these distributions are all normal, the function f is non-linear and therefore the resulting joint distribution is not Gaussian.

Approach

It is intractable to compute the posterior in Equation 1 directly. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
3.1

Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

In particular, we use the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), which was extended to
graphical models. Given a graphical model over the random variables X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN }, assume a target distribution π over X. For each variable xi , there is an associated proposal distribution Qxi , the distribution of new
samples for that variable.
Given a current assignment to X, MH randomly picks a
variable xi and tries to replace its value with a new sample
x0i drawn from the proposal Qxi . Let Y = X − {xi }.
The transition gain ratio for changing the sample xi to x0i
is defined as
T

Q

(xix0i )

Qx0i (xi )π(Y, x0i )
=
.
Qxi (x0i )π(Y, xi )

The probability of accepting this new sample x0i is

A(xix0i ) = min 1, T Q (xix0i ) .

(2)

(3)

Using the local independencies of the graph, this can be
decomposed into a set of local probabilities.
3.2

Qui = N (ui , Σ0u )
Qgj = N (gj , Σ0g ) .

Gaussian Assumptions

We assume that all the distributions are from the Gaussian
family. To be specific,

3

Gaussian with means at the previous embedded position:

If we choose the node ui to be resampled, we draw u0i from
Qui , and then compute the accept ratio for this change according to Equation 3. Using the local independence properties, the transition gain ratio with respect to the rating
function f is given by
Q
Qu0i (ui )Pu (u0i )
Pf (rij |u0i , gj )
TfQ (uiu0i ) =

j∈Gi

Qui (u0i )Pu (ui )

We use proposal distributions Qui for the node ui and Qgj
for the node gj . We set the proposal distributions to be

Pf (rij |ui , gj )

. (4)

j∈Gi

Similarly, the transition gain ratio for an item node, gj is
Q
Pf (rij |ui , gj0 )
Qgj0 (gj )Pg (gj0 )
j
i∈U
Q
. (5)
TfQ (gj gj0 ) =
Qgj (gj0 )Pg (gj )
Pf (rij |ui , gj )
i∈U j

We repeat the above resampling phase until the process has
mixed. The stationary distribution of this procedure is the
true posterior P (U, G|R).
3.3

Simulated Annealing

Recall that we want the arg maxU,G P (U, G|R). The
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm will give us joint samples
of U and G, drawn from that posterior. To get the samples
that maximize the posterior, we modify the standard MH
algorithm along the lines of the simulated annealing (SA)
algorithm (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983).
In particular, we modify Equation 2 to add an annealing
temperature, β:
Qx0i (xi )π(Y, x0i )β
Qxi (x0i )π(Y, xi )β

T Q (xix0i ) =

The transition gain ratios of equations 4 and 5 are then

Pf (rij |ui , gj )
TfQ (uiu0i ) =

Qui (u0i ) Pu (ui )

Sampling Approach

In our visualization problem, π is the posterior distribution
of U and G given R (Equation 1). Initially, we sample from
Pu for every ui and sample from Pg for every gj . This
jointly form a single starting sample (a joint assignment to
U and G) for our MCMC method.

The added temperature factor β grows gradually from 1 to
∞. Initially β = 1, and this method is the same as the

standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. As β grows, the
simulated annealing algorithm penalizes changes resulting
in lower likelihoods; the algorithm tends to only climb uphill in the posterior distribution.
3.4

Learn the Rating Function

Until now, we have assumed that the rating function f was
known. However, we would like this function to adapt to
the collaborative data.
It would be straight-forward to select f from a family (for
example the exponential, f (x) = e−λx ). However, the actual rating function may have a very different shape. Instead we note that all collaborative datasets of which we are
aware have a finite number of values for the ratings. Many
are binary (“like” or “do not like”) and others are based on
a five- or ten-point scale. Continuous, real-valued ratings
are seldom used. We therefore let f be a step function with
discrete quantizations.
We discretize f into K quantizations. Let Θ = {θi | i =
1, . . . , K} be the set of K splitting points in sorted order,
with θK = ∞. Given the set of splitting points Θ, the
rating function is
f (x; Θ) = 1 −

i−1
, if θi−1 ≤ x < θi .
K −1

The problem of learning f is now transformed to the problem of learning Θ:
Θ∗ = arg min
Θ

X

E[(f (kui − gj k; Θ) − rij )2 ] (6)

i,j|δij =1

where the expectation is with respect to the posterior distribution over U and G. This formulation is equivalent to
maximizing the probability of the ratings; the squared error in the above equation comes directly from the Gaussian
assumption regarding the distribution Pf .
We use expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to learn the rating function. We initially
set Θ = Θ0 , a random starting point that meets our requirements for f .
The E-step employs MH to sample from the expectations
in Equation 6 using the rating function f k = f (·; Θk ) at
the k-th iteration.
The M-step updates Θk+1 based on the generated sample
configurations of the embedded space (which approximate
the expectations of Equation 6). Using all the ui and gj
points, the optimal rating function is updated according to
Equation 6. Let N be the number of terms in the summation of Equation 6 (one for each rating for each sample).
The M-step optimization can be done efficiently (and exactly) in O(N K) time using dynamic programming.

Before updating the rating function in the M-step, we
renormalize all the points in the embedding space. Due
to our assumptions that Pu and Pg are fixed Gaussian distributions with zero mean and that we have the freedom to
change f , if the above procedure were run without modification, all the points would collapse together toward the
origin. Consequently, the learned rating function would
have splitting points with smaller and smaller values. We
fix this by a simple normalization step that scales and translates the points to reset the mean of all of the points to zero
and the variance of their positions to one. Note that this is
not a general “whitening” step in that we only multiply the
points by a scalar, not a matrix.

Overview of the Full Algorithm

To put everything together, the overall algorithm in our approach is listed in Algorithm 1. The parameters of this algorithm are ls (the number of samples used for estimating
the expectation), lb (the number of samples necessary for
the MCMC process to converge),  (the amount by which
to increase β), and the variances of the Gaussian distribu-

tions. In Section 4.2 we specify these quantities for the
experiments we ran.

Experiments and Results

We discuss our three datasets, our methodology for comparison, and then compare our algorithm to three others.
4.1

Experiment Datasets

The SAT dataset contains SAT II subject examination
scores for 40 questions chosen from a study guide of historic questions and 296 users. SAT II is a standard exam
taken by high school seniors applying to colleges in the
United States. All the scores are either 0 or 1 (indicating
whether the student got the question correct), and there are
no missing values. The 40 questions are from the subjects
French, Mathematics, History and Biology. The exam was
administered on-line over the course of one week.
The BGG dataset comes from www.boardgamegeek.com
which contains ratings from thousands of game players
and thousands of board games. The ratings range, in halfinteger increments, from 0 to 10. We picked the 400 users
and 80 games with the highest ratingPdensity. The rating
δij
matrix density, which we define as Pi,j 1 , is 63.4% for
i,j
this subset. Our snapshot of the dataset is from January
2005. The ratings are available publicly from the website.
Finally, the MovieLens dataset contains ratings from users
on a variety of movies. All the ratings are integers from 1 to
5. We picked 400 users and 50 movies, again to maximize
the rating density. The rating matrix density is 41.0% on
this subset. This dataset is publicly available from movielens.umn.edu.
4.2

Algorithm Initialization

Because we are learning the rating function f , the absolute
positions of the embedded points will not affect our approach directly. Rather, the relative positions of each point
matter. Therefore, the overall scale of Σu and Σg do not
affect the result.
In particular, for all the three datasets, we set Σu , Σg , Σ0u
and Σ0g each to be the identity matrix. We set σr = 0.25
for SAT, σr = 0.1 for MovieLens, and σr = 0.05 for BGG.
These values directly reflect the discretization of the rating
scores. Our informal tests show that the algorithm is not
sensitive to these particular numbers and we have made no
effort to tune them.
For the rating function f , we choose to set Θ0 directly using an M-step from the samples drawn from their priors.
For our experiments, we set ls = 2000, lb = 1000, and
 = 0.02 for all three datasets.

4.3

Implementation Issues

We compare our results with Locally Linear Embedding
(LLE) (Saul & Roweis, 2003), Eigentaste (ET) (Goldberg et al., 2001) and co-occurrence data embedding
(CODE) (Globerson et al., 2005). None of the algorithms
is exactly suited to our problem, so we discuss our adaptations in this section.
If we consider the rating matrix as a set of points in the
high dimensional space, we can use LLE to embed them
into a lower dimensional space. The LLE algorithm requires a full rating matrix R. This is not available for
the MovieLens and BGG datasets. We use linear regression to fill the missing ratings. To be specific, we first fill
each missing rating rij with average rating of ui . This results in full rating matrix. To predict the missing rating
rij using linear regression, for each item gk , let xk =
[r1k , . . . , r(i−1)k , r(i+1)k , . . . , rmk ]> , i.e. xk is the vector
containing all the ratings for gk except from ui . We then
use linear regression to find
h
i
X
ŵi , b̂i = arg min
(w> xk + b − rik )2
w,b

k

The predicted rating is then given by
r̂ij = ŵi> xj + b̂i .
Both LLE and ET can embed either users or items into an
Euclidean space. Yet, neither of them can embed both in
the same space. We tried several ways to extend them and
to make them comparable. One straight-forward way is to
embed all the user points first into the space. Then for every
item, find all the users who gave it its highest rating, and
place this item at the mean of those users points.
For our results, we used an alternative method, which performed better than the one above. Let R̂ be the full rating
matrix filled in using linear regression. We introduce a correlation matrix C among all n items. The diagonal Cii is
set to 1. Let Ri be the i-th column of R̂,
Cij =

Ri> Rj
.
kRi k · kRj k

We then let X = [C R̂> ] and use LLE or ET to embed X
into the target Euclidean space. The first n points correspond to the items and the last m points to the users.
ET only works if there is a gauge set of items which all
users have rated. However, in the MovieLens and BGG
datasets, no such gauge set exists. Using the above regression technique to fill in a gauge set results in bad (and
misleading) results, so we omitted them and have only included ET results for the SAT dataset.
The CODE algorithm requires co-occurrence statistics between users and items. The relationship between co-

occurrences and ratings is not clear. However, it is natural to assume rij is proportional to the probability of the
co-occurrence of ui and gj . Intuitively, a higher rating indicates it is more likely that the user and item “occur” at the
same time. We set the empirical distribution of (u, g) to be
proportional to the rating matrix (filled by linear regression
if there are missing ratings). We initialize the mappings
uniformly and randomly from the set [−0.5, 0.5]D as the
starting point for the optimization.
Our linear regression method for filling in missing values has proven reasonable on the prediction task, but admittedly it is not the most sophisticated algorithm possible. Therefore, to distinguish embedding factors from data
completion factors, we also ran our MCMC algorithm on
the completed rating matrix from linear regression.
Both our method and CODE have variable running times
(number of EM iterations in our case, number of random
restarts for CODE). For the results reported here, we gave
each 30 seconds of CPU time on a 2.8 GHz processor.
4.4

Sample Results

The SAT data was selected because of our ability to extract a “ground truth.” In particular, we expect that when
embedded, the questions from the same subjects should be
grouped together. Figure 1 shows the embedding for dimension 2 using the simulated annealing approach (along
with the three other approaches).
There are ten questions in each category. We can clearly
see that our method clusters all the French questions tightly
together. The same happens for the Math questions. (There
are eight Math questions that overlap in a small area.) The
other methods do not produce as tight clusters.
The History and Biology questions do not cluster as well.
Further data analysis has shown that there is very little predictability in the History and Biology questions, so this result is perhaps not surprising.1
1

The French and Math questions tended to test a body of
knowledge that is often retained as a coherent block, where as the
History and Biology questions on this exam tended to test more

Figure 1 also shows that the user points and the item points
intermix more evenly with our approach. This meets our
expectation that for any user, we can always find things
they like or dislike (questions on which they perform well
or poorly). In the embedding results of LLE, ET, and
CODE, a large number of user points lie in parts of the
graph outside the convex hull of the the question points.
This makes it impractical to make recommendations to
those users based on the visualizations.
4.5

Evaluation Criteria

There are no prior standard metrics for evaluating the quality of the embedded graph. In this work, we introduce
Kendall’s tau (Kendall, 1955) as a suitable evaluation criterion. Kendall’s tau is used to compute the correlation in
ordering between two sequences X and Y . It is especially
useful for evaluating the correlation between two sequences
that may have many ties.
Given two sequences X and Y of the same length, a pair
(i, j), i 6= j is called concordant if the ordering of Xi and
Xj is the same as the ordering of Yi and Yj . By contrast,
if the relative ordering is different, this pair (i, j) is called
discordant. If Xi = Xj or Yi = Yj , then (i, j) is neither
concordant or discordant, and it is called an extra x pair or
extra y pair, respectively.
Kendall’s tau is defined as
C −D
√
C + D + Ey C + D + E x

τ=p

(7)

where C is the number of all concordant pairs, and D is the
number of all discordant pairs. Ex and Ey are the numbers
of extra x pairs and extra y pairs.
It is easy to verify that τ is always between −1 and 1. τ = 1
indicates the two sequences have perfect positive correlation, and τ = −1 indicates perfect negative correlation.
τ = 0 indicates their orderings are independent.
To evaluate the quality of the graph in the embedded space,
for each test we randomly select a set of users, Ū , and
isolated blocks of knowledge.

Every algorithm was run on the same set of training and
testing sets.

The embedding algorithms will produce the embedded
points for those nodes in Ū and Ḡ given some additional
ratings. In order to evaluate the embedding quality, we generate two sequences and compute Kendall’s tau between
them: sequence X contains the actual ratings between all
the pairs ui ∈ Ū and gj ∈ Ḡ such that δij = 1, and sequence Y contains the distances between the corresponding ui and gj in the embedded graph.

For each of these datasets, Figure 2 shows the comparison
of our methods to LLE, ET, CODE, and a random embedding, as a function of the size of the training set. We also
computed an “ideal embedding” value for τ . Because of
ties, Kendall’s tau cannot always reach −1, so we calculate the lowest possible value for τ on the random dataset
drawn. This takes nothing into account except ties and it is
highly optimistic and probably not obtainable at such low
dimensions. The optimal values for SAT, BGG, and MovieLens datasets are approximately −0.63, −0.87 and −0.90
respectively. We ran LLE algorithm with training size starting at 22 for SAT and 24 for MovieLens because of matrix
inversion problems for smaller training sizes.

A good embedding will place ui far from gj if rij is small,
and close if rij is large. Kendall’s tau for the above two
sequences exactly evaluate this correlation. Denote τ to
be the Kendall’s tau for the sequences X and Y . Negative values of τ indicate good embeddings, and we expect
the values from embedding algorithms to be smaller than 0
(that of a random embedding).
4.6

Experimental Results

We ran our MCMC algorithm both with and without simulated annealing, along with LLE, ET and CODE. We randomly selected one quarter of the users and one quarter of
the items for testing (Ū and Ḡ from above). We randomly
selected other users and items to form a training set (Ũ and
G̃). All ratings between members of G̃ and Ũ , G̃ and Ū ,
and Ḡ and Ũ are used for training. As stated previously,
the ratings between members of Ḡ and Ū are used for testing. It is necessary to include the ratings between G̃ and
Ū (and likewise between Ḡ and Ũ ) in order to connect the
test users and items with the training users and items.
Because the existence of the test set, there are always missing ratings in the rating matrices used. We use linear regression to fill those ratings. We also ran the MCMC algorithm on the same filled data as LLE, ET and CODE used
(MCMC-REG in the graphs).
For each dataset size (number of items in G̃), we ran 25
independent experiments and recorded the means and stan-

Figure 3 shows another experiment with the same evaluation criteria. In this experiment, we fix the testing data as
usual, and use all the remaining data for training. The plot
shows Kendall’s tau as a function of the number of dimensions of the embedding space.

Analysis of the Results

From the experiments above, we can see that when the rating matrix is denser, the embedding algorithm achieve better results. Our sampling method, with (MCMC-SA) and
without (MCMC) simulated annealing, outperformed LLE,
ET and CODE. None of them were designed with this type
of data in mind, so we do not present these results to disparage those methods, but there were no other methods available to test against. Note that our MCMC algorithm on
linear regression filled data (MCMC-REG) has similar performance to directly applying our MCMC method on data
with missing ratings. This implies that it is not our regression that is causing the poor results from the other algorithms, but rather their misfit to this problem. We would
also note that our method also seems more stable (smaller
variance) than the other algorithms compared.

Figure 3: Performance of embedding algorithms on the three datasets as a function of embedding dimensions.
On the SAT dataset, which contains full density of ratings,
our algorithms show strong negative correlations which indicate good visualization results. In most cases, using
simulated annealing helps improve the quality of embedding (compared to “normal” MCMC). As the training size
grows, we have more information on the relations between
all the user and item points, and that leads to better performance for all the algorithms.
The BGG and MovieLens datasets have many missing ratings and the ratings values are more subjective and therefore noisier. Our algorithm is not as competitive with the
“ideal” value for Kendall’s tau, but we feel that this ideal
value is wildly optimistic in these settings. Our algorithm
does perform better than random embeddings, LLE, and
CODE.

Conclusions

We formulated a new problem of visualizing collaborative
data. This is a potentially very useful problem. Not only
are on-line databases of user ratings growing, but personal
databases are also becoming more common. We expect the
collaborative visualization problem to be useful in organizing personal music or photography collections as well as
on-line shopping.
We have not addressed the computational issues nor the
stability of the resulting embedding in this work. Both
are important problems for on-line deployment in changing databases. Because of the anytime nature of sampling
methods and the ease of introducing constraints, we are
hopeful that the solution presented here can be adapted to
provide stable and adaptive solutions.
