Motivating Example

Consider the following hypothetical situation, due to
a leak of some explosive, corrosive gas into a space
station's air, a state of emergency is automatically
declared.

There are two reasons to avoid accumu­

lation of gas - (a) to minimize the damage due to
corrosion, and (b) to prevent critical accumulation
that can cause an explosion.

Since a high concen­

tration of gas can cause an explosion, the response
is time-bound.
Let us presume that a number of methods are
stored in the station's main computer to deal with
various contaminations, utilizing such alternative
tactics as isolating contaminated areas, chemical
neutralization, and dehermetization of non-vital sec­
tors. The methods differ in their effectiveness, in the
amount of damage they cause, and in other material
losses; their effects are uncertain and are encoded by
probability distribution functions.
Given the details of a specific accident, the esti­
mated effect of any method can be determined by
computer simulation. Simulation running times are
also uncertain and depend on the inputs and the

Numerical Example

Consider the following problem: there are only two
methods - M , and M2 (M = {Mt, M2}). The
1
values of the solutions that are produced by these
methods can be only 0, 1, or 2 (D = 3). We need to
compute an optimal strategy for 3 periods (K= 3),
and we start with an alternative solution of cost 2
(i.e., CostAlt = 2, it will cost us 2 if we decide to do
nothing). Distributions of cost(sMk) for k= 1, 2 are
shown on Figure 2.
Starting with an optimal strategy for one (last) pe­
riod ( k = 1), we compute for c Alt = 0, C 1(M; , 0) for
i = 1, 2.
C1(Mt,O) = 0; C1(M2,0) = 0 => M 1(0) = Mt
(we recall that M1(0 ) denotes a method for which
C1(M; , O ) is minimized); C1(0) = 0.
For c Alt = 1, we obtain
C1(Mt, 1) = 0.6; C1(M2, 1) = 0.5 => M1(1) = M2;
C1(1) == 0.5.

the alternative cost was not reduced at Step 3. We
estimate next method M2(2)=M1• When (also ar­
bitrarily ) we find that cost(sM•) = 1, the alternative
cost is reduced to 1 and we continue by estimating
M1(1)= M2• Assume cost(sM2) = 2. At this point
deliberation halts, and since the current alternative

methods are encoded in the input stream.
Every method Mi, i = 1, .. , M is described by the
distribution of the cost of the solution, given as a
set of rational probabilities over the nonnegative in­
teger values, also given in the input. If the max­
imum number of values in cost distributions is D ,
and V = max { CostAlt , K } the length of the input
will be O(MDlogV).

Conjecture 4.1 Computing computationally-opti­

In the next section, we prove the NP-completeness
of a more general problem.

since for every entry we must compare M methods,
and evaluating each requires O(V) calculations.
Informally (Garey and Johnson [4]), an algorithm
has a polynomial-time complexity if it runs in a time
polynomial in the length of its input. I< MVD is
not a polynomial function of MDlogV, but it is a
polynomial function of MDlogV, I<, and V. An
algorithm that runs in time polynomial in its input
length and the largest number in the input has a
pseudopolynomial-time complexity, which is true in
our case.

Delibera­

tion Phase
In this section we extend the basic technique de­
veloped in Section 4 to handle cost and resource
consumption in the deliberation phase. First we in­
troduce the cost alone. Two new assumptions are
needed.
For any i '# j, distributions
and Cost (Mf) are independent.

Cost in the Deliberation Phase,
No Resource Consumption

Presence of the cost in deliberation phase may cause
an optimal strategy to estimate fewer methods. We
will appropriately change the definitions of Ck(cA1t )
and Ck(Mi, cAit):

Definition s:1 Ck(cA1t) is the optimal expected to­
tal cost for all the strategies consisting of at most
k methods and initiated with cAlt .

Ck(Mi, cA1t) is the optimal expected
total cost for all the strategies consisting of at most
k methods, initiated with cA1t, and beginning with
method Mi.

Note that by Assumption 3 only the expected value
of deliberation cost appears in this formula.
Finally, to provide for possibility that in some sit­
uations doing nothing could be the best strategy,
we introduce a new artificial method to be denoted
by M0• It is characterized by cost(Mo) = 0 and
cost(sMo) = CostAlt. Since the deliberation cost of
M0 is 0 it can be used without restriction and since
cost(sMo) = CostAlt it will never improve a current
alternative solution.
The definition of Ck(cA1t) will be altered to in­
clude M 0:
c�<(cA/t) = . min Ck(Mi,CAit)
•=D,l, .. ,M

(4)

c�<(cAit) computed recursively by {3}
and (4) is the optimal expected total cost for all the
strategies consisting of at most k methods with cost
in deliberation phase and initiated with cAlt .

Theorem 5.1

Proof is similar to that of Theorem 4.1. We
must only notice that since the deliberation cost is
independent of execution cost, the expected deliber­
ation cost is included in (3) and since the dummy
method Mo may now be selected, (4) must include
Mo. •
By Theorem 5.1, if Strategy 4.1 will compute
Ck(cA1') using ( 3) and (4) it will be an optimal strat­
egy with deliberation cost.
The space and computational complexity with de­
liberation cost are the same as without them, as pre­
sented in Section 4.

It is assumed that the interrupted method produces
no solution and incurs full computational cost.
In order to account for the resource consumption,
we must add a resource dimension to the strategy
table. Other than that, our discussion parallels the
development of the previous models. As with the
cost, we make an independence assumptions for re­
source consumption distribution functions.

In this model the estimate of every method causes
the consumption of some quantity of a single re­
source, described by the distribution Res(Mi), i =
1, 2, . . , M, from the total level - r- available in the
beginning of the process.
With one exception, we assume uninterruptability
of methods: when the total resource consumption
reaches r the deliberation process is interrupted and
the best solution available at this point is executed.

For any i and j, distributions
and Res(Ml) and

Res(M l) and Cost ( sMf ) ;
Cost(Ml )are independent.

Similarly to the previous case, we define:

5.3 c�< (cAit' r ) is the optimal total ex­
pected cost for all the strategies consisting of at most
k methods, initiated with cAlt, and that can be exe­
cuted within resource limit r.

5.4 ck(Mi' CAit' r ) is the optimal total
expected cost for all the strategies consisting of at
most k methods, initiated with cAit, that can be exe­
cuted within resource limit r , and begin with method
Mi .

We also define:
Ck(cAl t,r ) = min Ck(M i,CAlt,r )

Theorem 5.2

The proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.1.
We must only notice that since the resource con­
sumption is independent from cost, (6) is correct.
Proof:

It remains to modify Strategy 4.1 to include resource management. The optimality of the Strategy
5.1 follows from the Theorem 5.2.

for every entry we must com­
pare M methods, and evaluating each requires V2
calculations. The algorithm has pseudopolynomial­
time complexity.
Computing computationally-optimal
real-resource strategy is NP-complete problem.

Theorem 5.3

Our problem can be easily solved
by nondeterministic automaton by branching non­
deterministically every time a new method must be
generated. Next, we will show that our problem re­
stricts to Integer Knapsack Problem (see p. 247 [4])
i.e., Integer Knapsack Problem is a special case of
our problem. Set C = K. Define a method for each
u E U: set cost(Mi) =0, res(Mi) = s(u), and define
the distributions of execution cost by p(cost(sM•) =
1) = 10-v(u), p(cost(sM;) = 0) = 1-10-v(u). Set
r = B, GostAlt = 1. Solving this real-resource strat­
egy problem will solve Integer Knapsack Problem.

insisting that the strategy be bounded; otherwise it
may never terminate, but we may not be given a
specific bound.
This section shows that in some cases - namely
when all methods have positive deliberation costa problem with unspecified bound may be reduced to
K-bound problem by calculating the upper bound.
In other cases the oo-bound problems may have no
bounded, optimal strategies- resource permitting,
it will always be beneficial to add another method
in hope to reduce the execution cost even further.
Theorem 6.1 finds the bound for problems with
positive deliberation cost.

Prede-

fined Step Limit
We now consider the most general case, correspond­
ing to our example in Section 2. In real-life situ­
ations we do not typically restrict the number of
steps, or iterations to be taken by a strategy. Our
concern is that the strategy be optimal while the ex­
act number of steps is not important. We are still

Proof: Let P be an instance of a problem with
positive deliberation cost. The deliberation cost of
any strategy for P using more than J{' steps will ex­
ceed the alternative cost, so such a strategy cannot
be optimal. Since the number of the possible strate­
gies containing at most I<' steps is finite, an optimal
strategy exists, and has at most K' steps. •
The implementation of oo-bound strategy is obvi­
ous: 1) compute K'; 2) implement K'-bound opti­
mal strategy.

Related Work
Our work emphasizes the analysis of computationa­
lly-optimal control of deliberation before action.
Several approaches were suggested to related prob­
lems involving the control of deliberation.
Tokawa and Kim (10] treat a similar component­
selection problem in design-automation domain.
They suggest selecting components in random, and
evaluate the resulting strategy by its rank in a list of
all possible strategies. Ono and Lohman [7], consider
the problem of query optimization. They construct
a polynomial strategy for some types of queries us­
ing a dynamic programming formulation, but they
do not allow for uncertainty, and do not consider a
resource constraint.
Brooks [2], and Agre and Chapman [1] suggest
reactive approach to deliberation problem, and al­
though Brooks provides for deliberation when reac­
tion fails, neither Brooks', nor Agre and Chapman's
work offers optimal deliberation control methods as
those presented here.
Kaelbling [6] and Rosenshein and Kaelbling [8]
suggest avoiding deliberation by compiling in ad-

vance the programs responding within the given re­
source limit, but they do not allow for uncertainty,
and do not claim optimality with respect to all the
programs meeting the limit.
Horvitz [5] offers a decision-theoretic algorithm to
select a single method among the set of alternative
interruptible methods, and Fehling and Breese [3]
present a computational architecture and decision­
theoretic principles for real-time control.
In general, the reactive approaches focus on elimi­
nating the deliberation by sacrificing the optimality,
while the decision-theoretic work is traditionally ig­
noring the computational issues in pursued of an op­
timal solution. By introducing the computationally­
optimal strategies we reach an optimal balance be­
tween the deliberation and execution costs.

Summary and Future Work

In this paper we have stated a problem of finding
computationally-optimal real-resource strategies for
independent, uninterraptible solution methods, and
shown how to solve it for all practical purposes. The
problem, which we have shown to be NP-complete,
appears in numerous practical applications. We de­
veloped an algorithm that solves it in a polynomial
time if the alternative cost, resource limit, and num­
ber of steps have small values.
The results can be readily extended to the case of
multiple resources. This extension involves adding
a dimension to the strategy table for each new re­
source, it does not require any new technical ideas
and is left to the reader.
Future work may address validating our NP­
completeness conjecture, allowing dependencies
among the methods, and considering interruptible
methods.
