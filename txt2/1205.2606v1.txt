setting, which is not i.i.d. and where realizing what
portion of the model needs to be explored is crucial to
optimizing reward.
Recently, the introduction of the KWIK (Knows What
It Knows) framework [11] has provided a characterization of sufficient conditions for a model-learning
algorithm to induce sample-efficient behavior in a
reinforcement-learning agent. One of the first algorithms developed for this framework was a KWIK linear regression algorithm [15], which was used to learn
the transition function of an MDP with linear dynamics. In this paper, we present an algorithm that improves on both the sample and computational bounds
of this previous algorithm and apply it to a stable
of learning problems for reinforcement-learning agents
that employ “compact” representations. Specifically,
we use KWIK linear regression (KWIK-LR) to learn
the reward function in a factored MDP and the transition probabilities in domains encoded using Stochastic
STRIPS [12] or Object Oriented MDPs (OOMDP) [5].
We note that learning these parameters is not typically
associated with linear regression—this paper shows
that KWIK-LR can be used to help learn models beyond its standard usage in learning linear dynamics.
Because of the KWIK guarantees, agents using this
algorithm in these settings are guaranteed to make at
most a polynomial (in the parameters of the learned
model) number of sub-optimal steps with high probability. We present algorithms and theoretical arguments to this effect, including a general reinforcementlearning algorithm for agents that need to learn the
probabilities of action outcomes when these effects
may be ambiguous in sample data. Experimental evidence is also presented for benchmark problems in the
application areas mentioned above.
Our major contributions are an improved and simplified algorithm for KWIK linear regression, and
the sample-efficient algorithms that use KWIK-LR to
efficiently learn portions of compact reinforcementlearning representations, none of which have previ-

ously been shown to be efficiently learnable. We
also discuss extensions, including combining KWIKLR with other KWIK algorithms to learn more parameters of these compact representations.

KWIK Linear Regression

KWIK [11] (Knows What It Knows) is a framework for studying supervised learning algorithms and
was designed to unify the analysis of model-based
reinforcement-learning algorithms. Formally, a KWIK
learner operates over an input space X and an output space Y . At every timestep t, an input xt ∈ X
is chosen and presented to the learner. If the learner
can make an accurate prediction on this input, it can
predict ybt , otherwise it must admit it does not know
by returning ⊥ (“I don’t know”), allowing it to see
the true yt or a noisy version zt . An algorithm is
said to be KWIK if and only if, with high (1 − δ)
probability, ||b
yt − yt || < ǫ and the number of ⊥s
returned over the agent’s lifetime is bounded by a
polynomial function over the size of the input problem. It has been shown [10] that in the model-based
reinforcement-learning setting, if the underlying model
learner is KWIK, then it is possible to build an RL
agent around it by driving exploration of the ⊥ areas using an R-max [4] style manipulation of the value
function. Such an agent will, with high probability,
take no more than a polynomial (in the parameters
of the model being learned) number of suboptimal actions. In this paper, which deals with compact representations where the parameter sizes are far smaller
than the enumerated state space, we will call agents
that satisfy these conditions, but may require superpolynomial (in the size of the compact parameters)
computation for planning, PAC-compact-MDP.
One of the first uses of the KWIK framework was in
the analysis of an online linear regression algorithm
used to learn linear transitions in continuous state
MDPs [15]. This algorithm uses the least squares estimate of the weight vector for inputs where the output
is known with high certainty. Certainty is measured
by two terms representing (1) the number and proximity of previous samples to the current point and (2)
the appropriateness of the previous samples for making a least squares estimate. When certainty is low for
either measure, the algorithm reports ⊥. In this work,
we present a KWIK-LR algorithm that is more sample
and computationally efficient than this previous work.
First though, we define some notation.
Let X := {~x ∈ Rn | k~xk ≤ 1}, and let f : X → R
be a linear function with slope θ∗ ∈ Rn , kθ∗ k ≤
M , i.e. f (~x) := ~xT θ∗ . Fix a timestep t. For
each i ∈ {1, . . . , t}, denote the stored samples by

UAI 2009

~xi , their (unknown) expected values by yi := ~xTt θ∗ ,
and their observed values by zi := ~xTi θ∗ + ηi , where
the noise ηi is assumed to form a martingale, i.e.,
E(ηi |η1 , . . . , ηi−1 ) = 0, and bounded: |ηi | ≤ S. Define
the matrix Dt := [~x1 , ~x2 , . . . , ~xt ]T ∈ Rt×n and vectors
~yt := [y1 ; . . . ; yt ] ∈ Rt and ~zt := [z1 ; . . . ; zt ] ∈ Rt , and
let I be an n × n identity matrix.
2.1

A New KWIK Linear Regression
Algorithm

Suppose that a new query ~x arrives. If we were able to
solve the linear regression problem Dt θ = ~zt , then we
could predict yb = ~xT θ, where θ is the least-squares
solution to the system. However, solving this system directly is problematic because: (1) if Dt is rankdeficient the least-squares solution may not be unique
and (2) even if we have a solution, we have no information on its confidence.
We can avoid the first problem by regularization, i.e.
by augmenting the system with Iθ = ~v , where ~v is
some arbitrary vector. Regularization certainly distorts the solution, but this gives us a measure of confidence: if the distortion is large, the predictor should
have low confidence and output ⊥. On the other hand,
if the distortion is low, it has two important consequences. First, the choice of ~v has little effect, and
second, the fluctuations caused by using ~zt instead of
~yt are also minor.
Let At := [I; DtT ]T . The solution of the system At θ =
[(θ∗ )T ; ~ytT ]T is unique, and equal to θ∗ . However, the
right-hand side of this system includes the unknown
θ∗ , so we use the approximate system At θ = [~0T ; ~ztT ]T ,
which has a solution θb = (ATt At )−1 ATt [~0T ; ~ztT ]T . Define Qt := (ATt At )−1 . The prediction error for ~x is

If kQt ~xk is small, then both terms of (1) will be small,
although for different reasons. If kQt ~xk is larger than
a suitable threshold α0 , our algorithm will output ⊥,
otherwise it outputs yb, which will be an accurate prediction with high probability.

Algorithm 1 describes our method for KWIK-learning
a linear model. Notice it avoids the problem of storing
At and ~zt , which grow without bound as t → ∞. The
quantities Qt = (ATt At )−1 and w
~ t = ATt [~0T , ~ztT ]T are
sufficient for calculating the predictions, and can be
updated incrementally (see Algorithm 1). The algorithm is KWIK, as shown next.

Fix t and drop the subscripts of ~xt , At and Qt . Suppose a new sample ~x arrives and the algorithm decides
that it is “known”, i.e., kQ~xk ≤ α0 . The first term
of the P

αk+1 < kQ~xk ≤ αk . The number of ~x inputs falling in
the range (αk+1 , αk ] is at most mk+1 . We can bound
the squared sum of the weights of the noise terms:

This result is a Θ(n2 / log2 n) improvement over the
sample complexity of Strehl & Littman’s KWIK online
linear regression, and requires Θ(n2 ) operations per
timestep, in contrast to their O(tn2 ) complexity.

Proof sketch of Theorem 2.1

The second term of the prediction error (1) is ~xT Qθ∗ ,
which can be bounded by ~xT Qθ∗ ≤ kQ~xk kθ∗ k ≤
α0 M. This will be no more than ǫ/2 if α0 ≤ ǫ/(2M ).
We now consider the first term of (1). Fix a constant
α ∈ R, and let m be the number of timesteps when
kQt~xt k > α. We show that m < 2n/α2 . We proceed
by showing that the traces of the Qt matrices are positive, monotonically decreasing, and decrease considerably when kQt~xt k is large. Q1 = I, so trace(Q1 ) = n.

Application 1: Learning Rewards in
a Factored-State MDP

A Markov decision process (MDP) [16] is characterized by a quintuple (X, A, R, P, γ), where X is
a finite set of states; A is a finite set of actions;
R : X × A → R is the reward function of the agent;
P : X × A × X → [0, 1] is the transition function; and
finally, γ ∈ [0, 1) is the discount rate on future rewards.
A factored-state Markov decision process (fMDP) is a
structured MDP, where X is the Cartesian product
of m smaller components: X = X1 × X2 × . . . × Xm .
A function f is a local-scope function if it is defined
over a subspace X[Z] of the state space, where Z
is a (presumably small) index set. We make the
standard assumption [9] that for each i there exist
sets Γi of size O(1) such that ~xt+1 [i] depends only on
~xt [Γi ] and at . The transition probabilities are then

Algorithms exist for learning transition probabilities [9] and dependency structure [14], but until now,
no algorithm existed for learning the reward functions.
For J > 1, we can only observe the sums of unknown
quantities, not the quantities themselves. Doing so requires the solution of an online linear regression problem with a suitable encoding of the reward model. Let
Nr be the total number of parameters describing the
reward model (Nr ≤ J|A|nnf ), and consider the indicator function χ(~x, a) ∈ RNr , which is 1 on indices
corresponding to Rj (~x[Zj ], a) and 0 elsewhere.
Our solution, Algorithm 2, is a modification of Algorithm 1. We initialize all unknown rewards to some
constant R0 (analogous to the common maximum reward parameter Rmax [4]). If R0 is sufficiently high,
the algorithm outputs optimistic reward estimates for
unknown states (instead of ⊥), and otherwise gives
near-accurate predictions with high probability. This
property follows from standard arguments [17]: for unknown states, the noise term of the prediction error
can be bounded by Azuma’s inequality, and R0 can
be set high enough so that the second term is positive and dominates. This form of optimistic initialization has proven consistently better than R-max in flat
MDPs [17]. For known states, the KWIK guarantees
suffice to ensure near-optimal behavior. Because it
combines a KWIK model-learner with R-max style exploration, this algorithm is PAC-compact-MDP—the
first efficient algorithm for this task. In Section 5.1 we
combine this algorithm with another KWIK learner
that learns the transition dependency structure and
probabilities [11] to learn the full fMDP model.

Experiments

We carried out reward-learning experiments on the
Stocks domain [14], with 3 sectors and 2 stocks per
sector. Rewards were uniformly random in the interval [0.5, 1.5] for owning a rising stock, and random in [−1.5, −0.5] for owning a decreasing stock.
We compared six algorithms: (1) Algorithm 2; (2)
Algorithm 1 modified to output Rmax in unknown
states; (3) the previous state-of-the-art KWIK-LR algorithm [15] modified to output Rmax in unknown
states; (4) a flat tabular reward learner; and to demonstrate the need for efficient exploration, (5) linear regression without exploration and (6) linear regression
with epsilon-greedy exploration.
Each algorithm was run 20 times for 250 steps, updating the model every 5 steps. For the Stocks(3,2)
domain, Rmax = 6. We used R0 = 10 for Algorithm 2,
α0 = 1.0 for the second approach and α1 = α2 = 1.0
for the third one. The values of the learned policies
are shown in Figure 1. All curves except (1) and (2)
differ significantly on a 95% confidence level. Notice
(3) and (5) take longer to learn the model, (4) takes
far longer, and (6) fails to explore and find the correct
model.

Learning Transition Probabilities

We consider another novel application of KWIK linear regression—learning action-effect probabilities in
environments where these effects may be ambiguous. Specifically, we consider environments where actions are encoded as stochastic action schemas (e.g.
travel(X, Y) rather than travel(Paris, Rome)) and the
effects of these actions are stochastic. For instance,
the action travel(X, Y) may result in the effect at (Y)
with probability .9 and the effect at (X) with probability .1. More formally, every action a ∈ A is of the

UAI 2009

WALSH ET AL.

form a = [(ω0 , p0 ) · · · (ωn , pn )] where each ωi ∈ Ωa is
a possible effect. When the action is taken, one of
these effects occurs according to the probability distribution induced by the pi s. The schemas may also
contain conditional effect distributions, the nature of
which is determined by the specific language used (as
discussed in the following subsections). This form of
generalization has been used to encode many different types of environments in RL, including stochastic
STRIPS [12], Object Oriented MDPs (OOMDPs) [5],
and typed dynamics [13]. Learning these probabilities
is non-trivial because for a given state action pair (s,
a), the effects are partitioned into equivalence classes
E(s, a) = {{ωi , ωj , ωk }, {ωl , ωm }, ...} where each e ∈
E(s, a) contains effects that are identical given state
s. For instance, if an action has two possible effects
Holding(X) and Holding(Y), but is taken in a state
where X and Y are both already held, we cannot tell
which actually occurred. Notice that the probability
of any equivalence class is equal to the sum of the
probabilities of the effects it contains, hence the link
to linear regression.
The standard “counting” method for learning probabilities cannot be used in such a setting because it
is unclear which effect’s count (Holding(X)s or Holding(Y)s) we should increment. However, KWIK-LR
can be used to learn the probabilities. While standard
linear regression could also be used if transition data
was available in batch form, an RL agent using KWIKLR can learn the probabilities online and maintain
the PAC-compact-MDP guarantee needed for effective
exploration. Algorithm 3 presents a PAC-compactMDP algorithm for an agent that is given full actionoperator specifications, except for the probabilities.
That is, since our focus is on learning the probabilities,
we assume that each ωi is known, but not the pi s. We
also assume the preconditions and reward structure of
the problem are known. We discuss methods for relaxing these assumptions in Section 5. This algorithm can
be used with several representations including those
mentioned above.
Intuitively, Algorithm 3 computes an optimistically
optimal action at using a planner (Line 7, detailed
below) and then gathers experience indicating which
of the equivalence classes et ∈ E(st , at ) actually occurred. For instance, it may see that Holding(X) occurred, instead of Holding(Y). This equivalence class
contains one or more effects (ωi , ωj ... ∈ Ωa ), and an
indicator vector ~x is created where ~xi = 1 if ωi ∈ et
(Line 10). For instance, if the agent was not holding anything, and then Holding(X) occurred and not
Holding(Y), the vector would be [1; 0], but in a state
where both were already held, ~x would always come
out [1; 1]. Note that each equivalence class in E(s, a)

induces a unique (and disjoint) ~x. Each of these is used
to update the KWIK-LR learner (Lines 9-11), with an
output (y) of 1 associated with the ~x that actually
happened (which may have 1s in multiple places, as
in the ambiguous Holding case). Given any possible
action and equivalence class in the state/action space,
the KWIK-LR agent can now be queried to determine
the probability of the equivalent transition (Lines 5-6),
though it may return ⊥, identifying transitions from
equivalence partitions that have unlearned probability.
Planning in Algorithm 3 is done by constructing a
transition model in the grounded state space (Lines
4-6). KWIK-LR determines for each E(s, a), the
probability of the possible next states (one for each
e ∈ E(s, a)). A modified version of value iteration [16]
(Line 7) is then used to plan the optimal next action.
The modification is that at every iteration, for every
state-action pair that has effects with known probabilities K = {ωi , ωj ...} and unknown probabilities
U = {ωk , ωl ...}, the effect in U that leads to the highest value
P next state is considered to have probability
1 − ωi ∈K P (ωi ). This change is designed to force
value iteration to be optimistic—it considers the most
rosiest of all models consistent with what has been
learned. We note that planning in the flat state space
can require exponential computation time, but this is
often unavoidable, and since the model is still learned
in a sample efficient manner, it satisfies the conditions
for PAC-compact-MDP.

Application 2: Stochastic STRIPS

STRIPS domains [8] are made up of a set of objects
O, a set of predicates P , and a set of actions A. The
actions have conjunctive (over P ) preconditions and
effects specified by ADD and DELETE (DEL) lists,
which specify what predicates are added and deleted
from the world state when the action occurs. Stochastic STRIPS operators generalize this representation

by considering multiple possible action effects specified by hADD, DEL, PROBi tuples as in Table 1.
Notice this representation is an instance of the general action schemas defined above. While others have
looked at learning similar operators [12], their work
attempted to heuristically learn the full operators (including structure), and could not give any guarantees
(as we do) on the behavior of their algorithm, nor did
they identify an efficient algorithm for learning the
probabilities, as we have with Algorithm 3. To make
the planning step well defined, we consider Stochastic
STRIPS with rewards [18].
Table 1 illustrates a variant of the familiar
Paint/Polish domain in the Stochastic STRIPS setting. There are several ambiguous effects. For instance, executing paint on a scratched but not painted
object, and observing it is now scratched and painted,
one cannot tell which of the first two effects occurred.
We used this domain with a single object to empirically test Algorithm 3 against a version of the algorithm that does not use KWIK-LR, instead attempting to learn every possible equivalence class partition
distribution separately (Partition). Because the focus
here is on learning the transition probabilities (pi s),
both learners were given the preconditions and effects
(ωi ) of each action. We discuss relaxing these assumptions later. Figure 2 shows the results (with the
known/unknown thresholds empirically tuned) averaged over 1000 runs with randomized initial states for
each episode (both learners receive the same initial
states). Algorithm 3 learns much faster because it effectively shares information between partitions.

Figure 2: Average steps to the goal over 1000 runs.

Application 3: Stochastic Object
Oriented RL

Object-oriented MDPs [5] consist of a set of objects O,
a set of actions A that take elements of O as parameters, and (in the original deterministic description)
a set of condition-effect pairs hc, ωi associated with
each action. Objects have attributes, and the set of
all objects and their attribute values at a given time
t constitute the state st . When an action a is executed from st , the environment checks which condition
ci ∈ C is satisfied (if any), and applies the corresponding effect wi ∈ Ωa , which updates the attributes of the
affected objects. Stochastic OOMDP effects generalize
this representation so that a given condition induces
not just a single effect (ω) but a distribution over possible effects (Ωca ), only one of which (ωi ) will actually
occur on a single timestep. In the parlance of action
schemas as defined above, each {c, Ω} pair for action a
can be thought of as its own action with preconditions
specified by c. Again, this model can be viewed as a
specific version of the action schemas presented above.
Previous work [5] presented an efficient algorithm for
learning deterministic effects. Here, we demonstrate
Algorithm 3 learning the probabilities associated with
each effect in the stochastic setting when the possible
effects given a condition and the conditions themselves
are known in advance. Methods for relaxing these assumptions are discussed in later sections.
We demonstrate Algorithm 3 for stochastic OOMDPs
on a simple 5 × 5 Maze domain, illustrated in Figure 3.
The agent starts at location S and the goal is to arrive
at G. Each step has a cost of −0.01, and arriving at
the goal results in a reward of +1. The agent’s actions
are N, S, E and W. When executing an action, the
agent will attempt to move in the desired direction
with probability 0.8 and will slip to either side with
probability 0.1. If it hits a wall, it stays put. This
rule is what produces ambiguity in the effects. For

example, imagine the agent has a wall to its North
and East. If it attempts the N action, it could move
to the West (with probability 0.1), or stay in place. If
it stays in place, it might be because it attempted to
move North (with probability 0.8) and hit the North
wall, or it attempted to move East (with probability
0.1) and hit the East wall.
Figure 4 presents the results. As in the previous experiment, we can see that the KWIK-RL algorithm learns
much faster than the “Partition” learner by sharing information between equivalence partitions.

Extensions

We now discuss extensions for learning more of the
compact representations discussed in this work. We
will outline how to learn full fMDPs and larger parts
of STRIPS and OOMDP models by combining KWIKLR with other KWIK learners, and provide empirical
support in the fMDP case. We also discuss a variation of KWIK-LR that can be used to learn stochastic
action-schema outcomes (Ωa ).

Combining with Other KWIK Learners

Existing work [11] describes methods for combining
simple KWIK agents to learn in increasingly com-

plex domains. We follow this “building blocks” approach and show how to combine the fMDP rewardlearning algorithm (Algorithm 2) with an implementation of the Noisy-Union [11; 10] algorithm (which
is also KWIK) to learn the transition structure (Γ),
transition probabilities (P ), and reward function (R)
of an fMDP all at once. The only knowledge given to
the agent is the number of parents a factor may have
(|Z|) and the reward-function structure, resulting in
the only algorithm to date that learns all of these parameters efficiently. Experience is fed to both building
block algorithms in parallel. The reward learner outputs an optimistic approximation of the reward function, which is given to Noisy-Union, which then learns
the transition structure and probabilities. We conducted experiments to validate this algorithm in the
Stocks domain. For comparison, we also ran the NoisyUnion algorithm with the rewards given a priori. Figure 5 displays the results, which show that all three
quantities can be learned with small overhead.
We note that there are many other settings that could
benefit from combining KWIK-LR with other KWIK
learners for different parts of the model. For instance,
in stochastic STRIPS and OOMDPs, the preconditions of actions (STRIPS) or the conditional effects
(OOMDP) can be learned using an existing KWIK
adaptation of Noisy Union [6] as long as their size is
bounded by some known constant. Together, these
learners could be used to learn all but the effects (Ωa )
of each action operator, a problem we now consider.

Future Work: Learning Effects

All of the effect distribution / condition learning variations require the possible effects (Ωa ) as input. Unfortunately, relaxing this assumption in the stochastic
case is unlikely, since the effect learning problem is
known to be NP-Hard [12]. When the number of possible effects is very small, or each ωi is of constant size,

enumeration techniques could be used. But, these assumptions are often violated, so researchers have concentrated on heuristic solutions [12]. Here, we suggest
a novel heuristic that extends KWIK-LR for probability learning to the setting where the whole action
schema (including Ωa ) needs to be learned.
We propose using sparsification; we consider all possible effects and use KWIK-LR to learn their probabilities, with an extra constraint that the number of “active” (non-zero) probabilities should be small. This
minimization can be efficiently computed via linear
programming, and techniques such as column generation may be used to keep the number of active constraints small in most cases. Together with the other
learners discussed in this paper, the implementation of
such an extension would form a complete solution to
the action-schema learning problem: the probabilities
and preconditions can be learned with KWIK-learners
and the effects themselves can be learned heuristically
using this sparsification extension. It remains a matter for future work to compare this system to other
heuristic solutions [12] for such problems.

Related Work

Online linear regression has also been studied in the
regret minimization framework (see e.g. [1]). Applications to restricted RL problems also exist [2], but
with different types of bounds. Furthermore, regret
analysis seems to lack the modularity (the ability to
combine different learners) of the KWIK framework.
Previous work on linear regression for model-based RL
has focussed on learning linear transition functions in
continuous spaces. However, these approaches often
lacked theoretical guarantees or placed restrictions on
the environment regarding noise and the reward structure [7]. In this paper, we have both improved on the
current state-of-the-art algorithm for linear regression
in RL [15], and used it in applications beyond the standard linear transition models. Our theoretical results
and experiments illustrate the potential of KWIK-LR
in model-based RL. In the future, we intend to identify
other compact models where this technique can facilitate efficient learning and perform expanded empirical and theoretical studies of the extensions mentioned
above.
