gray will indicate similar levels of both values.

For

instance, figure 4 shows the result for three close con­
curring "black" observations next to a single "white"
observation. In one case the information is corrected to
take into account the fact that close points are related
and do not express independent sources. In the other
one we have made a plain Dempster combination. We
can see that the three black points combined have an
influence similar to a single point.

In the limit case

where the three points are exactly identical we would
have exactly the same result as with only one point
(illustrating this would not be very spectacular). Fig­
ure 2 nonetheless shows different levels of interpolation
varying with the distance between concurring observa­
tions, with or without the Choquet-like correction.

We chose the following experimental framework: we

Information intensity maps

Our framework can be used to measure the variations
of the quantity of information over space.

In order

to do so, we may compute a probability distribution
on S at each point of E, using for instance the pig­

nistic transform, and the information level at each

point can then be computed using usual information-

Minimal entropy is obtained at points at which

at a complete observation has been made.

Maximal

entropy is obtained at points associated with a uni­
form probability distribution (if any). Note that this
uniform probability distribution may come either from
conflictual observations or from a lack of information:
as explained in Section 3.2, once the combined mass
assignment has been transformed into a probability
distribution, there is no longer a way to distinguish

An information intensity map already gives some hints
about where it should be interesting points to make
new measures: measures seem more useful in regions
in which the information quantity is low.

However,

picking the point of E with the lowest amount of in­
formation is not sufficient in general.

Especially, it

is relevant to make a difference between points where
nothing is known because the observations are too far,
and the ones where there is conflict between observa­

measurement has to be made; (2) the measurements
have uniform costs; (3) the utility of a gain of infor­
mation does not depend on the value observed nor
on the location of the measurement.

The more gen­

eral problem of determining an optimal measurement
policy over a given number of steps can be cast in
' the framework of Partially Observable Markov De­
cision Processes.

This requires the specification not

only of measurement costs but also a utility function
which grows with the global amount of information
(and which possibly takes account of the relative im­
portance of some values or of some regions). This point
is left for further research, and should be positioned to
the recent work of [D. Kortenkamp and Murphy, 1997]
extending the idea of occupancy grids with the use of
MDP.
Once a series of measurements has been done, one may
decide either to stop the measurements, or, if the quan­
tity information is considered high enough (relatively
to the expected cost of new measurements), we can
then easily compute a "plausible map" from the re­

We are now interested in the following problem: given
a set of observations 0, where (and what) is it worth­
while to measure next? This problem, already consid­
ered in the field of robotics (where it has received a
pure probabilistic treatment), is relevant not only for
exploring geographical data but also for the question of
granularity dependent representations. Indeed, given a
coarse-grain representation of spatial information seen

correction decreases the likeliness of a value near con­
curring measures.

In practise, it would probably be

better to decide of a threshold under which the belief
in a value is irrelevant before pignistic transformation.
If we know indeed that the belief in value 1 is 0.05,
and belief in value 2 is 0.04, (thus the belief in the
set {1,2} is 0.91), we don't want to assume it is more
likely that value 1 holds and thus we would like the
map to remain undetermined at this point.

9This heuristics is widely used in model-based diagnosis
when choosing the next test to perform.

By modelling intuitions about the likelihood of spa­
tial properties which depend only on distance factors
(persistence, influence), we have shown how to infer
plausible information from a set of observations. The
field is now open to experimental investigations of the
various parameters we have introduced in a generic
way, as our ideas have been quite easy to implement.
Our way of extrapolating beliefs could be applied to
other fields than spatial reasoning.

However, these frameworks do not consider

possible interactions before combining, probably be­
cause this issue is less crucial in the contexts they con­
sider than in spatial reasoning.
We think a number of paths can be now followed
that would show the relevance of this work for spatial
representation and reasoning.

First of all, we now

need to focus on the intrinsic characteristics of spatial
properties that may influence the parameters we have
considered here.

Persistence is certainly dependent

on more factors that mere distance (for instance,
rain is influenced by terrain morphology), and it
would be useful to isolate which kind of information
could be combined with our framework. The second
orientation we have only sketched here is related
to spatial decision problem.

If we are interested in

identifying the extension of a spatial property (let's
say the presence of oil in the ground for the sake of
argument), it would be useful to take into account
information about the possible shape (convex or not)
or the possibly bounded size of the observed fluent,
as it will influence the location of an interesting (i.e.
informative) new observation.
