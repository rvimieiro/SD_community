To plan is to find a policy that will lead an agent to

the shortest sequence of actions that leads the agent
to the goal.

POMDPs by using MDPs. This paper generalizes the
idea. We transform a POMDP by assuming that, in
addition to the observations obtained by itself, the
agent also receives a report from an oracle who knows
the true state of the world. The oracle does not report
the true state itself. Rather, he selects, from a list of
candidate regions, a region that contains the true state
and reports that region. The transformed POMDP is

number of researchers concern themselves with plan­
ning in stochastic domains (e.g.

Dean and Wellman

1991, Cassandra et al 1994 , Boutillier et al1995, Parr

and Russell 1995). Partially observable Markov deci­

sion processes (POMDPs) can be used as a model for
planning in such domains.

In this model, nondeter­

minism in effects of actions is encoded by transition
probabilities, partial observability of the world by ob­
servation probabilities, and goals and criteria for good
plans by reward functions.
POMDPs are difficult to solve and approximation is

W hen all candidate regions are singletons, the oracle
actually reports the true state of the world. In such
a case, the region observable POMDP reduces to an
MDP. MDPs are much easier to solve than POMDPs.
One would expect the region observable POMDP to
be solvable when all candidate regions are small.

In terms of quality of approximation, the larger the
candidate regions, the less extra information the ora­
cle provides and hence the more accurate the approx­
imation. In the extreme case when there is only one

to the original POMDP.

A policy 1r prescribes an action for each possible belief

possible belief states to A. For each belief state b,
1r(b) is the action prescribed by 1r for b. The value
function of 11" is defined for all belief states b by v11" (b) =
Eb(L:o ·lrt], where 0<-y<1 is the discount factor and
rt is the reward received at the tth step in the future.
Intuitively, it is the expected discounted reward the
agent can expect to receive starting from belief state
b if it behaves according to policy 1r. An policy 1r* is
optimal if v,..• (b);::: V,..(b) for all b and all other policies
1r.
The value function of an optimal policy is called
the optimal value function and is usually denoted by
v•.
Policies for POMDPs can be found through value it­
eration (Bellman 1957). Value iteration begins with
an arbitrary initial function "Y(t{b) and improves it by
using the following equation

Vt(b) = maxa[r(b,a) +-y LP(o + lb,a) Vt 1( b+)], (3)

where P(o+ lb ,a) = Ls,s+ P(s+, o+ls,a)b(s), and b+ is
a shorthand for b+(-lb,a, o+)· If V0*=0, 'V;* is called
the t-step optimal value function.
It is well known that when the Bellman residual

to V* and the greedy policy based on vt*

is a good approximation of the optimal policy (e.g.
Puterman 1990).
Since there are uncountably infinite many belief states,
value iteration cannot to carried out explicitly. For­
tunately, it can be carried out implicitly due to the
piecewise linearity of the t-step optimal value function
(Sondik 1971). More specifically, there exists a list Vt
of function of s, usually referred to simply as vectors,
such that for any belief state

vt*(b) = maxvEV1 L V(s)b(s).

find a minimum list of vectors that satisfies the
above equation. Unfortunately, even the most effi­
cient algorithm can only solve POMDPs with no more
than twenty states and fifteen observations exactly
{Littman et al1995, Cassandra et al1997). Approxi­

Most previous approximate methods (e.g. Cheng 1988,
Lovejoy 1991b, and Parr and Russell 1995) attempt to
find a list of vectors that satisfies equation (5) approxi­
mately. This paper proposes to approximate POMDPs
themselves by others that have more informative ob­
servations and hence are easier to solve.

PROBLEM CH ARACTERJSTICS
AND APPROXIMATIONS

We make the following assumption about problem
characteristics. Even though in a POMDP M the
agent does not know the true state of the world, he
often has a good idea about it. See the introduction
for justifications of this assumption.
Consider another POMDP M' which is the same as
M except that in addition to the observation made by
itself, the agent also receives a report from an oracle
who knows the true state of the world. The oracle does
not report the true state itself. Rather he selects, from
a list of candidate regions, a region that contains the
true state and report that region.
More information is available to the agent in M' than
in M; extra information is provided by the oracle.
When the agent already has a good idea about the true
state of the world, the oracle does not provides much
extra information even when the candidate regions are
small. In such a case, M' is a good approximation of
M.
In M', the agent knows for sure that the true state of

the world is in the region reported by the oracle. For
this reason, we say that it is region obseroable. The
region observable POMDP M' can be much easier to
solve than M when the candidate regions are small.
For example, if the oracle is allowed to report only sin­
gleton regions, then he actually reports the true state
of the world and hence M' is an MDP. MDPs are much
easier the solve than POMDPs.
We now set out to make the idea more concrete. Let
us begin with the concept of region systems.

POLICY FOR THE ORIGINAL

POMDP

Suppose we have solved the region observable POMDP
M'. The next step is to construct a policy 1r for the
original POMDP M based on the solution forM'.
Even though it is our assumption that in the original
POMDP M the agent has a good idea about the state
of the world at all time, there is no guarantee that its
belief state will always be in B"R.· There is n o oracle in
M. A policy should prescribes actions for belief states
in Bn as well as for belief states outside BR.. An is­
sue here is that the policy 1r' for M' is defined only
for belief states in BR.. Fortunately, 1r1 can be natu­
rally extended to the entire belief space by ignoring
the constraint bEB"R. in equation (6). We hence define
an policy 1f forM as follows: for any bEB,
1r(b)

=

arg m axa[r(b, a)+ 1 L P(z+lb, a)Ui(b+)]. (7)
Z+

Let k be the radius of the region system underlying
M'. The policy 1r for M given above will be referred
to as the mdius-k approximate policy for M. The en­
tire process of obtaining the policy, including the con­
struction and solving of the region observable POMDP
M', will be referred to as region-based approximation.
It is wor t hwhile

to compare this equation with equa­
tion (4). In equation (4), there are two terms on the
right hand side. The first term is the immediate re­
ward for t aking action a and the second term is the
discounted future reward the agent can expect to re­
ceive if it behaves optimally. Their sum is the total
expected reward for taking action a. The action with
the highest total reward is chosen.

The second term is difficult to obtain. In essence,
equation (7) approximates the second term using the
optimal expected future reward the agent can receive
with the help of the oracle, which is easier to compute.
It should be emphasized that the presence of the oracle
is assumed only in the process of computing the radius­
k approximate policy. The oracle is not present when
executing the policy.
QUALITY OF APPROXIMATION

6

AND SIMULATION
In general, the quality of an approximate policy 1f is
measured by the distance between the optimal value
function V"'(b) and the value function V..-(b) of 1f. This
measurement does not consider what the agent might
know about the initial state of the world. As such, it is
not appropriate for a policy obtained through region­
based approximation. One cannot expect such a policy
be of good quality if the agent is very uncertain about
the initial state of the world because it is obtained
under the assumpti on that the agent has a good idea
about the state of the world at all time.

This section describes a scheme for determining the
quality of an approximate policy in cases where the
agent knows the initial state of the world with cer­
tainty. The scheme can be generalized to cases where
there is a small amount of uncertainty about the ini­
tial state; for example, cases where the initial state is
known to be in some small region.

The agent might need to reach the goal fro m dif­
ferent initial states at different times. Let P(s) be
the frequency it will start from state sl. The qual­
ity of an approximate policy 1r can be measured by
Ls IV*(s)- V��"(s)IP(s), where V*(s) and V��" denote
the rewards the agent can expect to receive starting
from state s if it behaves optimally or according to 1f
respectively.
By definition v• (s);?: V"��" (s) for all s. Let u• be
the optimal value function of the region observable
POMDP M'. Since more information is available
to the agent in M', U*(s);?:V•(s) for all s. There­
fore, 'E.[U • (s) - V��"(s)]P(s) is an upper bound on
L8[V*(s)- V��"(s)]P(s).
Let

1r1 be the policy for M' given by (6). When the
Bellman residual is small, 7r1 is close to optimal for M 1
and the value function v.,..' of 1f1 is close to u·. Con­
sequently, L:8[V��"' (s)- V��"(s)]P(s) is an upper bound
on L:,[V*(s)- v1r(s)]P(s) when the Bellman residual

is to conduct a large number of simula­

M'. In M, the agent chooses, at each step, an action
using 1r based on the its current belief state. The ac­
tion is passed to a simulator which randomly generates
the next state of the world and the next observation

F igure 2: Experiments with standard action and noisy
models. The POMDPs are accurat el y approximated
by region observable POMDPs with radius zero or one.

Complexity of Solving the POMDPs

8.3

One of the POMDPs have 280 possible states while
the other has 200. They both have 64 possible ob­
servations and 4 possible actions. Since the l argest
POMDPs that researchers have been able to solve exactly so far have less than 20 states and 15 observations, it is safe to say no existing en.ct algorithms can
solve those two POMDPs.

Quality of Approximation for Standard
Models

To determine the quality of the radius-0 and radius-1
approximate policies for the POMDPs with s tand ard
action and observation models, 1000 simulation trials
were conducted using the scheme described in Section
6. It was assumed that the agent is equally likely to

We see that the radius-1 approximations took much
longer time to solve than the radius-0 approximations.
Also notice that the region observable POMDPs with
noisy action and observation models took more time
to solve that those with the standard models.
We were unable to solve the radius-2 approximations.
Other approximation techniques need to be incorpo­
rated in order to solve th e approximations based on
region sy stems with radius larger than or equal to 2.

Simulation results are shown in Figure 2. The curves

simulations in the radius-0 region observable POMDPs
(i.e. with the help of the oracle) using their opti­
mal policies. In contrast, the curves rO represent the
g-functions for simulations in the original POMDPs
(without the help of the oracle) using radius-0 approx­
imate policies. For readability, only top portions of the
g-functions are shown.

in the opposite room, or in the left most room, or in

the room to the right of the goal location. The perfor­
mance would be close to optimal if the goal location
had some distinct features.

In environment A, the agent, again under the guidance
of the radius-! approximate policy, was able to reach
and declare the goal successfully once it got to the
neighborhood. However, it often took many unneces­
sarily steps before reaching the neighborhood due t o
the undesirable effects o f the turning actions.

Take

the lower left corner as an example. When the agent
reached the corner from above, it was facing down­
ward. The agent executed the action turn_left. Fif­
teen percent of the time, it ended up facing upward
instead of to the right - the desired direction. The
agent then decided to move-forward, thinking that it
was approaching the goaL But it was actually moving
upward and did not realize this until a few steps later.

CONCLUSIONS

We propose to approximate a POMDP by using a
region observable POMDP. The region observable
POMDP has more informative observations and hence
is easier to solve. A method for determining the qual­
ity of approximation is also described, which allows
one to make the tradeoff between quality of approxi­
mation and computational complexity by starting with
a coarse approximation and refining it gradually. Sim­
ulation experiments have shown that when there is not
much uncertainty in the effects of actions and obser­
vations are informative, a P OMD P can be accurately
to approximated by a region observable POMDP that

be solved exactly. However, this becomes infeasi­
the degree of uncertainty increases. Other ap­
proximate methods need to be incorporated in order to
solve region observable POMDPs whose radiuses are
not small.
