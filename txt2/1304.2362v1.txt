Although early work on automated diagnostic systems was much inspired by probabilistic inference and
decision theory (Ledley & Lusted, 1959;. Gorry & Barnett, 1968), many researchers later became
disenchanted with this approach. Reasons cited include the difficulty of obtaining the required numerical
probabilities and utilities, computational intractability, restrictive assumptions, and the apparent mismatch
between the quantitative formalism of decision theory with human reasoning (Szolovits & Pauker, 1978).
Thus, in the 1970s, this work was partly eclipsed by the development of AI approaches, which appearea
more tractable and compatible with human thinking. More recently, however, there have been signs of
renewed interest in the application of decision theoretic ideas in AI (Lemmer & Kanal, 1986; Horvitz,
Breese & Henrion, in press). This has partly been due to increased misgivings about the assumptions and
reliability of widely used heuristic methods for reasoning under certainty, and to the emergence of more
tractable approaches based on probabilistic representations and decision analysis
(e.g. Pearl, 1986;
Henrion & Cooley, 1987).
Our focus here is on the application of decision analysis to troubleshooting, and particularly to sequential
diagnosis, that is decisions about which diagnostic test to perfonn next and when to stop testing. We
defme the test sequencing task as the problem of finding the testing strategy that minimizes the total
expected cost. This task is central in any kind of diagnosis, from medicine to mechanical and electronic
devices.
If one has a causal model of the device that is entirely deterministic, logical analysis can identify possible
explanations of the observed faults (e.g. Reggia et al, 1983; Genesereth, 1984; Milne, 1987). Intuitively it
seems clear that test selection should involve some kind of balancing of the cost of the test against the
chance it will provide useful information. This suggests that it is desirable to quantify the degree of belief
in the logically possible explanations. Decision theory provides a way of quantifying the value of tests in
the form of the expected net value of information (ENVI). This is a measure of the informativeness of the
test, in terms of the expected value due to improved decision making, less the expected cost of performing
the test.
Gerry & Barnett (1968) demonstrated the application of this approach to test sequencing in medical
diagnosis. As they illustrate, the use of the ENVI can give one a voracious appetite for numbers. In

205

I
addition to the expected costs of the tests and quantifications of their diagnosticity, one requires the prior
probabilities of the alternative hypotheses (diseases), and the expected total cost to the patient for each
combination of treatment and disease (both correct and incorrect diagnoses). Further. the ENVI for
multiple tests are not additive, so the expected value of two tests is not the sum of their expected values.
Typically, the ENVI for each testing strategy must be computed separately. With many possible tests, the
number of strategies is vast For this reason, Gorry & Barnett used a "myopic" approach that considers
only one test at a time, rather than an entire strategy. This is suboptimal in general, but they found it to be
a good heuristic.

In many ways troublesho.oting of mechanical and electronic devices is much easier than medical

diagnosis. The usual end point is the positive identification of the faulty component to be repaired or
replaced, so the possibility of ultimate misdiagnosis can often be neglected. If all testing strategies result
in the same end point, the costs of treatment (or mistreatment) are irrelevant. Only the costs of performing
the tests are of concern when selecting tests. Typically these costs may be quantified relatively easily in
terms of the time required, that is the costs of the diagnostician's time and/or the machine downtime.
Further simplifying matters is the fact that there often exists a causal model of the device which is largely
or entirely deterministic. Such a luxury is not usually available to the medical diagnostician. Moreover,
for many machine components and subsystems, tests can determine with virtual certaintly whether they
are faulty. These aspects of troubleshooting make test selection far more amenable to a decision analytic
approach than in medicine. In some cases, the optimal test selection algorithm can be very simple, as we
shall see.
·

Our purpose in this work is twofold: First, to demonstrate the practicality of decision analysis for test
sequencing for troubleshooting; and second, to compare experimentall y the performance of this decision
theoretic approach with a more conventional expert system approach employing test selection rules
obtained from expert diagnosticians. After presenting the decision analytic formulation we will describe
its application to the example of diagnosing of motorcycle engines, to examine its performance in terms
of the expected cost (or time) to complete the diagnosis. Finally, we will examine the robustness of the
results, and discuss their practical implications.

2.

Decision analytic approach

We start by presenting a decision analytic approach to sequential diagnosis for a device representable by a
deterministic fault model. We will not develop the formulation beyond the generality required for the
experimental example.

2.1. Single level test sequence task

Suppose the system to be diagnosed consists of a set of elementary components, i from 1 to n. We
assume that each component is in one of two states, working or faulty, and that the system fails in some
observable way if there is a fault in any element Given the system failure, we assume that there is a fault
in exactly one component This is a reasonable assumption for most systems, where the chance of two
. elementary components failing simultaneously is negligible. We assume that, given the system has failed,
the probability of a component i failing is Pi· Since the failures are mutually exclusive, the probabilities
sum

to unity.

We further assume that for each component there is a corresponding test which will tell us for certain
whether it is working. The test might involve simple inspection, replacement of the component by an
identical one known to work, probing with electronic test gear, or a variety of other operations. We
assume that for each element i, the cost of testing is ci, independent of the test sequence. We assume for
simplicity that even if the fault is in the last element, which we can deduce if none others are faulty, we
will test it anyway for positive identification.
The test sequence task is to fmd the strategy that minimizes the expected cost to identify the faulty
component. It turns out that the optimal strategy is extremely simple: Select as the next element to test
the one that has the smallest value of the ratio C/Pi• and continue testing until the faulty element is
identified. We will call this the

CIP algorithm.

It is not hard to prove this result. Let Sjk be the strategy of testing each element i in sequence for i from 1
ton, until we find the faulty component We certainly will have to incur the cost C1 of testing the first
component e1. If that is working, we will have to test the second element, and so on. The probability that
the jth element having to be tested is the probability that none of its predecessors failed, which is also the
probability that either the jth element or one of its successors has failed, i.e. L.7=JPi· Let j and k be two
successive elements in this sequence, so k=j+ 1. Then the expected cost of strategy Sjk is:

Let Skj be the same strategy, but with elements j and k exchanged. The expected cost of this strategy is:

i=2

i=k

i=j

The difference in expected cost between these two strategies is then:

EC(Sjk)-EC(Skj) =Cjpk- C kPj
Assuming the probabilities are positive, we get:

EC(Sjk)>EC(S�g)<=>C/Pj>Ck!Pk
In other words, strategy S1g is cheaper than Sjk if and only if the ClP value for element j is greater than the

C!P value fork. Thus any strategy with an element that has a higher C/P value than its successor can be
improved upon by exchanging the successive elements. So for an optimal strategy, all elements must be
in non-decreasing sequence of C/P value. This gives us our C/P algorithm.
This task is an example of what Simon & Kadane (1975) have called satisficing search. They show that a
similar algorithm is optimal for the related search task, in which the events that each element contains a
fault (or prize in their version) are independent rather than exclusive. They cite a number of similar
results, and provide an algorithm for the generalized task with an arbitrary partial ordering constraint on
the search sequence. See also Kadane & Simon (1977).

3. Experiment:
For the purposes of experimental comparison we chose the problem of diagnosing motorcycle engines.
This choice was guided by two reasons. Firstly we had available an existing knowledge base for
motorcycles. This allieviated the task of knowledge engineering. Secondly the motorcycle domain
provided us with a problem that was small and simple enough to be manageable but still promising
enough to make an interesting comparative study. The first goal was to explore the feasibility of
implementing it in a real-world task domain, and obtaining the numerical probabilities and test costs
required. The second goal was to evaluate its performance in terms of average cost to arrive at a diagnosis
compared to the test sequence rules derived from human experts.
3.1. The rule· based approach:

Given the task domain, we identified 5 commonly occuring symptoms. Symptoms are understood as any
deviations from expected behaviour. Symptoms can be directly observable or can be detected as a result
of some measurement(s). Associated with each symptom is a set of elementary faults which might cause
the given symptom. These elementary faults correspond to components that need to be repaired or
replaced by the mechanic. The symptoms along with their corresponding symptoms are listed in table
3-1. Associated with each symptom is an expert rule that specifies the sequence of elements to be tested
in that situation. These rules were obtained from extensive consultations with experienced mechanics and
a standard reference manual (Harley Davidson). While eliciting these rules we asked the experts to keep
in mind that the objective was to diagnose the fault as quickly as possible.
We interviewed three different mechanics. One of the mechanics refused to prescribe rules on the claim
that all symptoms were quite straightfoward and with appropriate audio visual tests the faulty component

could be exactly located. Unfortunately he was not able to characterize these tests beyond asserting that
they are based on long years of experience. The other two experts did provide us with rules. Sometimes
for a given symptom these rules differed marlcedly between experts. This difference did not affect our
experimental study as we were only comparing the rules and C/p sequences for each given expert.

3.2. The decision analytic approach:

For purposes of comparison we applied the decision analytic approach to the same set of symptoms we
developed for the rule-based approach. We preserved all the assumptions made in section 2 for both
approaches. Firstly all variables (namely symptoms and components) are binary, either working or not
working. Both approaches also assume that there is only a single elementary component at fault.

The failure probabilities and test costs were obtailll!d by interviews from motorcycle mechanics of many
years' experience. The failure probabilities were assessed in groups. conditional on their common
symptom. Given a symptom, the approximate absolute probabilities for different components (which
cause the symptom) were assessed. The numbers were subsequently noimalized. The costs were
estimated as the average time in minutes the expert would take to deteimine whether each component was
working.
The. cost estimates between experts differed by upto a factor of three. The ordering of costs for a given
symptom was consistent between experts. The difference in the absolute cost estimates can be attributed
to personal differences. On the other hand, the probability estimates across experts was starkly different.
For a given symptom, even the relative ordering of failure rates of components did not match across
experts. One likely cause for this is the fact that different experts saw different samples of motorcycles.
The mechanics who worked at dealerships were more likely to service new bikes which they had recently
sold. Mechanics working in garages were more likely to see older bikes. As mentioned earlier these
differences are not critical for this study.
For each symptom, we applied the C/P algorithm to obtain a test sequence, which we will refer to as the
CIP sequence to distinguish it from the expert rule. We also showed the C/P sequences to the expert to
check real world feasibility.

The C/p algorithm provides a reduction in expected cost of diagnosis for 3 to 4 out of 5 cases, reducing
the diagnostic time by an average (across experts) by 14%.

3.4. Sensitivity Analysis

The failure probabilities and test costs are of course quite approximate, being subjective judgments by the
expert. An important question for any approach based on expert judgment, be it decision analytic or
heuristic, is how much the results depend on the precise numbers used. Is it possible that the expert rules
could in fact be optimal according to the C/P algorithm, if only we had obtained the expert's "actual"
probabilities and costs? Let us examine how much bias or error would there have to be in the assessment
process for this to happen.
For a given symptom, we associate with each component a probability distribution over the failure rate
and the cost of testing. Since the failure rate itself is a probability it's range is [0,1]. Therefore we
describe the failure rate as a logoddnormal distribution with the mean as the estimated value p and an
error factors. The range [mls,ms
. ] encloses 70% of the probability distribution. Similarly we associate a
lognormal distribution for the cost with mean as the estimated value C and an error factor s. Now the
difference between the expected cost for C/p sequence and the expert rule is itself a probability
distribution with s as a parameter. We assume that s is the same for all the distributions. Figure 3-1

209

I
shows the cumulative density function of the difference (of the expected cost between the C/p sequence
and expert rule) for a selected symptom with s=2. Figure 3-1 also graphs the boundaries for difference
2.5, the
which encloses 70% of the distribution around the mean. From this graph we see that for s
lower boundary intersects the zero-line. In other words if the error factor is 2.5 then the expert rule and
the C/p sequence have the same expected cost.

Sensitivity Analysis for "poor-idling'

I

Such an analysis for all symptoms, over all experts shows that the C/p sequence dominates the expert rule
for error factors up to 2.5. This suggests that the results obtained are fairly robust to errors in cost and
failure rate estimates.

I

3.5. Further consulations with experts

I

A major motivation for constructing fonnal models is the possibility that such models may improve on
the intuitive inference of the expert. Hence when the fonnal models lead to results different from those
suggested by experts, it becomes critical to explain these differences to the experts. If explanations (from
within the fonnal framework) are acceptable and the results insightful then the fonnal models have served
their purpose.
Keeping the above criterion in mind, we went back to the experts with the C/p sequences. Firstly, both
experts found the C/p sequences to be feasible. Hence the C/p sequences did not violate any implicit
realworld constraints. When it came to convincing the experts about the superiority of the C/p sequence
the results were mixed. Expert 2 was a little surprised at the difference between his sequencing and the
C/p sequencing. A careful explanation of the C/p algorithm convinced him of the dominance of the C/p
sequence. He readily agreed that the C/p sequence was better at minimizing the expected cost. On the
other hand expert 1 was not impressed by the C/p sequence. He felt that his sequences followed a causal
pathway while checking for faults which he thought was more desirable. This bias for causal paths made
him reject the C/p sequences.

4. Discussion

The results presented in section 3.3 suggest that the expected cost of diagnosis is significantly lower (at
least for some cases) for the decision analytic approach. This result can be understood in light of the
difference in test sequences obtained from human ex�rts relative to those derived from the C/p
algorithm. In order to explain and draw conclusions from this result we need to discuss three possible
shortcomings of the experimental setup.

The cost and failure rate estimates are approximate. Therefore it is possible that the inaccuracies in these
estimates might affect the test sequences derived from the C/p algorithm. However the sensitivity
analysis in section 3.4 shows that the results are quite robust to inaccuracies in the cost and failure rate
estimates.
The decision analytic approach sequences tests to optimize the expected cost of diagnosis. This approach
is in fact too simple to model other constraints on test sequences which might arise from the shape and
structure of the machine under consideration. As a result the C/p algorithm might in fact be ignoring
implicit but vital constraints on the test sequences. On the other hand the expert rule might have
implicitly accounted for such constraints and the difference in the two approaches might be attributed to
this factor. In order to check for this possibility, we presented the experts in question with the C/p
sequence for their comments. Specifically we were interested in the real world feasibility of the C/p
sequences. We encouraged the experts to suggest reasons as to why the expert sequences might be
preferable, so as to identify any implicit real world constraints that might be violated by the C/p sequence.
The C/p sequences used are ones that were found acceptable to the experts. We interpret this to mean that
the C/p sequences are indeed feasible ones.
The last question we need to worry about is whether the human experts (in the task domain) were actually
attempting to minimize the expected time for diagnosis. There is a real possibility that the experts in fact
had some other objective function. It is indeed more than plausible that experts have over time evolved
these sequences to maximize economic return for each given symptom. The rules might maximize the
time for diagnosis, subject to constraint that customer will not think it unreasonable.

5. Conclusions

The results of this study clearly indicate that the test sequences provide by the experts (in the task
domain) are suboptimal. Unfortunately there is uncertainty regarding the objectives which motivate the
expert test sequences. This restrains us from drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of human
intuition for this task domain. But it is important to remember that one of the experts accepted the
validity of the C/p sequence and felt that the results are likely to be of practical interest. This suggests
that normative theories of decision making are capable of obtaining results which go beyond current
expert opinion.
This study also provides some valuable insights regarding knowledge acquistion for diagnostic expert
systems. Diagnostic problem solving can be understood as follows:
·

•

Given a symptom we have a set of components which can potentially explain the symptom.
The physics and the structure of the problem provides a partial order on the set of test
sequences allowable on the set of components. Since the partial order does not completely
constrain the test sequence, we can optimize the expected cost of diagnosis over this set of
feasible test sequences.

The knowledge required for this optimization could be acquired in two ways:

1. As an expert rule which picks one test sequence from this set of feasible test sequences.
This corresponds to the rule-based approach of our study.

2. We can push level of knowledge acquistion a level deeper and explicitly represent the cost
and failure rates.

These are once again assessed from experts.

This corresponds to the

decision analytic approach of our study.
Our study suggests that it possible to explicitly represent the cost and failure rates and it provides better
control on the objective of optimizing the expected cost of diagnosis.
