the agent's degree of belief in Tweety !l yi ng

is 0.8, is n ot

objective, as its truth is determined by whether or not tlle
pr obability of the set of worlds where Tweety flies is

0.8.

Although we cannot easily characterize an agent's degr ees
of beliefs as being correct or incorrect, it is nevertlleless
clear that these beliefs should have some rel ation to objec­
tive reality. One way of guaranteeing this is to actually

generate them from the objective information available to
the agent. Several ways of doing this h ave been consid­
ered in the literature; for example, [BGHK92, PV92] each

discuss several possibilities. The appr oach es in {BGHK92)
are based in a very natural way on tlle semantics des cr ib e d
above. Assume we have a (prior) probability distribution
over some set of worlds.

We cru1 t11e n generate degr ees

of belief from an objective know ledge ba�e KB by u sin g
standard Bayesian conditioning: to t11e formul a 'P we a�­
sign as its degree of belief the conditional prob ab i lity

of

r.p given KB. In [BGHK92] we considered three particu­
lar choices for a prior, and i nve stigat ed the properties of
the resulting inductive inference sy stem s.

In

[BGHK93]

we concentrated on the simp lest of these methods-the
choice of prior is essen­

random-worlds m eth od-whose

tially the uniform prior over the se t of possible worlds.

More precisely, suppose we re strict our attention to worlds
(i.e., interpretations of ru1 appropriate vocabul ary for first­

order logic) with t11e domain

{ I, . . . , N}.

Assumin g we

have a finite vocabulary, there will be only finitely many

such worlds. Random worlds ta kes a'> the set of worlds all

of these worlds, and uses p erh ap s the s i mpl e st probability
distribution over them-the uniform distribution�thus as­
suming that each of t11e worlds is eq u ally likely. This gi ves
a prior distribution on the set of pos sibl e worlds. We can
now induce a degree of belief i n 'P gi ven KB by using the
conditional probability of 'P

given Kll with respect to this
of

uniform distribution. II is ea-;y to see that the degree

belief in r.p given KB is then s i mply tJ1e fraction of possible
worlds satisfying KB that also sati s fy 'P· In general . how­

ever, we do not know the domai n size N; we know only
that it is typically large. We cm1 therefore appro x i mate the

degree

of belief for the true but unknown

N

by computing

the limiting value of this degree of be l ief as N g rows large.
This limiting value (if it exists, which it may not) is denoted

�( r.piKB), and it is what the rando m -w orld method takes

to be the degree of belief in 'P given

Hence, we would like to

Why do we wrun to take into account subjective beliefs?

Generating New Beliefs from Old

like to extend it so that it can also deal with subjective infor­
mation. This is an issue that has received some attention re­
cently [PV92, Jae94b, Jae94a]. We discuss lhree techniques

by us in g cross-entropy [KL51]. Given two probability dis­
tributions p and p', the cross-entropy of p1 relative to J.l,
denoted C(1/, 1•), is a meao;;ure of how "far" J.t1 is from J.l

here, and consider their application in the specific context
of random worlds. As we shall see, all of our techniques

yet there are some interesting connections between them.
In particular, in the context of random-worlds they gener­
ally yield the same answers (where the compruison makes
sense; the various methods have different nmges of applica­
bility). Many of the results we discuss are, in general terms

if not in specific details, already known. Nevertlleless, th eir
combination is quite interesting.
We now describe the three methods in a lillie more detail.
The first method we exrunin e is

perhaps the simplest to ex­

Fix N. Random worlds considers all of the worlds that have
domain { 1, ... , N}, ru1d assumes they are equal ly likely,
which seems reasonable in the ab sence of information to
the contrary. But now suppose that we have a degree of
belief such as Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8. In thi s case it is no longer
reasonable to assume that all worlds are equally likely; our
knowledge base tells us that the worlds where b is red are
plain. We consider it first in

[SJ80, Sho86]. Given an inference method that generates

approach of making all worlds equally likely. Intuitively,

we can deal with at least tl1i s examp le.

We simply use the

the worlds in the sets determined hy Red(b) and -.Red( b),
and then scale these weights wi thin each set so that the sets
are assigned probabi l i ty 0.8 ru1d 0.2 respectively (Readers

generally, we might hope that given an inference
and a knowledge bao;;e of t11e form KB A BB,
we can gen erate from i t a collection of objective knowl­
edge hase� KD i, .. , KB,. suc h tlmr I( 'PIKB /\ BB) is a
weighted average of I(;pJKBI), ..., I(lf'IKBm). as in the
example. In general. ho wever achieving this in a reasonable
fas h ion is not so easy. Consider t11e belief base BB�;rd =
(Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8) 1\ (Pr(.'inw/!(b)) = 0.6). In this case,
we would like to d efi ne 1 (Cardinal( b )JKBbird 1\ BB�;rd) us­

Snwll(b)), I(Cardinal(b)IKBbint 1\ Red(b) 1\ --,Smnll(b)),

the we i ght of the tenn l(Cardinal(b)JKBbird 1\ Red(b) 1\
Small( b)) to he the degree of belief in Red( b) 1\ Smnll(b).
Unfortunately, while ss;,;rd tells us t11e degree of belief in
Red( /1) and Small( b) separately, it does not give us a degree
of hel ief for their conjunction. A superficially plausible
heu ri sti c would he to ao;; sume that Red( b) and Smnll(b) are
independent. and thus assi gn degree of belief 0.8 x 0.6 to

at other times it is completely inapp rop riate For example,
if our knowledge base asser ts that all small things are red,
then Red( b) and Snwll( b) cannot be independent, and we
should dearly take the degree of belief in Red(b) 1\ Smnll( b)
to he the same a� the degree of belief in Small( b), namely,

One reason­

to computing t11ese degrees of belief is to
make the smaflesr c hange possible to achieve consistency
with the hclief hase. Here, as before, cross-entropy is a
u seful tool. Indeed, a� we shall show, there is a way of
able approach

40

Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller

applying cross-entropy in this context to gi ve us a general
approach. We call Ibis method CEF, for cross-entropy on
formulas. Altbough both CEW and CEF use cross-entropy,
they use it in conceptually d i fferen t ways. As the names
suggest, CEW uses cross-entropy to compare two probabil­
ity distributions over possible worlds, while CEF uses it to
compare two probability distributions over formulas. On
the other hand, any probability distribution on worlds gen­
erates a probability distribution on formulas in th e obvious
way (tbe probability of a formula is the p rob abil i ty of the set
of worlds where it is true), and so we can use a well-known
property of the cross-entropy function to observe that the
two approaches are in fact equiv ale nt when they can hmh

be applied.

It is worth noting that the two approach es are actua.lly in­
comparable in their scope of application. Because CEF is
not restricted to inference processes tlJat generate a pri or
probability on a set of possible worlds, it can be app lied
to more inference processes than CEW. On the other hand,
CEW is applicable to arbitrary KB's while, as we shall see,
for CEF to apply we need to make mo re restrictions on the
form of the KB.

the metho ds also agree when appli ed to our version of the
ME process and when applied to random worlds. Putting
t11e results together, we can show that all these metbods­
CEW, CEF, and RS-agree when applied to random worlds
and in fact, CEW and CEF agree in general. In addition,
,

t11e r esu lt ing extension of random worlds agrees with the
approach obtained when we apply CEF and RS to the ME

process.

The rest of this paper is organi zed as follows. In the next

sect i on we r evi ew the formal model of [Ha190] for degrees

of belief and statistical information, and some material from
[13GHK93] regarding the random-worlds method. We give
the formal definitions of t11e three metbods we consider in
S ecti on 3, and discuss their equivalence. In passing, we
also d i sc uss the conn ecti on to Jeffrey's rule, which is an­
other very well known met11od of updating by uncertain
infonnation. We conclude in Section 4 witb some discus­
sion or computational issues and possible generalizations
of lhesc approaches.

The third method we consider also app l i es only to certain
types of in ference processes. In panicu1ar, it take� a.<. its
basic intuition that all degrees of belief must ultimately he
the result of some statistical process. Hence, it re q u ires an
inference process tlmt cm1 gene rate degrees of belief from
statistics, like random-worlds. S uppo se we have the belief
Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8. If we view th is belief as havin g arisen
from some statistical sampling process, then we can regard
it as an abbreviation for statistical information ahout the
class of individuals who are '�just li ke b". For example, say
that we get only a quick glm1ce at b, so we are not certain
it is red. The above asser ti on could be con strued as being
an abbreviated way of saying that 80% of the objects that
give a similar sense perception are red. To capture this
idea formally we can view b as a membe r of a small set
of (possibly fictional) ind ividual s S that are "'just like b" to

the best of our knowledge, and ass u me that our degrees of
belief about b actually represents the statistical information
aboutS: IIRed(x)IS(x)llr � 0.8. Once all degree ofhelief
assertions have been convert e d into statistical assertions.
we can tben apply any method for in fer r in g degn:es of
belief from statistical knowledge bases. We call this the
RS method (for representative set). The general intuition
for this metbod goes back to s tatistical mechanics [Lan80J.
It was also defined (independently it seems) by Paris and
Vencovska [PV 92); we follow their presentation here.
Paris and Vencovska showed t11 a t the RS method and the
CEF metbod agree when app li ed to their version of the ME
process. Using results of[GHK92, PV89], we can show that

CEW

As w e ment ioned in

the introduction, our first metllod,

CEW, assumes as input an inference process I that proceeds
by generati ng a pri or Jl f on a se t of possible worlds W1 and
t h e n conditioning on th e objective i n formati on . Given such
an inference process I , a k n owl ed ge base KB (that can con­
tain subjective infonnation) and an objective formula cp, we
wish t o co m p u te CEIV ( I)(<piKB), where CEW(I) i s a

new degree of belief generator that can handle knowledge
bases that can include subjective infmmation.

We say that an inference process I is world-based if there is
some structure M1 = (Wr , llt )and a tolerance r such that

l(�PIKB) = [Pr(lf'IKB)]M 1,T . Notice that Pr;_;rw is world­
based for each N (where the structure corresponding to
Pr;_;rw is MjV ). �, on the other hand, is not world-ba<;ed;
we return to this point shortly.

Given a world-based inference process I, we define
as follows: Given a knowledge base KB which
can be an arbitrary formula in the full language .C, let Jt.}8
be the probability distribution o n WI su ch t11at C(Jl}8, JlJ )
is minimized (if a unique such distribution exists) among all
distributions tl such that (WI , p' , T ) I= Pr(KB) = l. Intu­
itively, pf8 is the probability distribution closest to t he prior
Jli that gives KB probability l . Let Mf8 = ( WI , JLf8). We
can then define CEW(I)( c.oiKB ) = [Pr( cp)J.�1Ks ' T .

CEW(I)

The first thing to observe is that i f KB is objective, then
standard properties of cross-entropy can he used to show
that pf8 is t11e condilional distri b u t i o n I'· I C l KI3 ) . We thus
immediately get:
Proposition 3.1: lfKB is objective, then CEW( I ) ( <.p j K I3 )
l(lf' I KB ) . Thus, CEW(I) is a true extension of !.

Another important property of CEW fo llow s from the wel l ­
known fact that cross-entropy generalizes Jeffrey 's rule
[Jef92]. Standard probability theory tells us that if we
start with a probability function p an d observe that event
E holds, we should update to the conditional probabi lity
function Jl. ( · I E). Jeffrey's rule is mean t to ueal w i th the
possibility that rather than get ting certain i n formation. we
only get partial information, such a<; that E hold s with proh­
ability o:. Jeffrey's rule suggests that in tl1 i s case. we should
update to the probability function p' such that

tt'(A)

=

o:JI.( A I E ) + ( I - rr )p ( A IE) .

where E denotes the complement of E. 111 i s rul e uniformly
rescales the probabilities within E and (separately) those
within E so as to satisfy the constrain t Pr( E) = a. Clearly,
if o: = 1 , then Jl1 is j ust the conditional prohab i l i t y p( · I E ) .
This rule can be generalized i n a strai ght forward fashion .

The formulas lf' l , . . . , lf't.: conespond to mu tually ex clu sive

that to compute the degree of belief in If' g i ven this knowl­
edge base, we should compute tile degree of belief in 'P

combination. Using t11e fact Umt cross-entropy generalizes

As we observed above, CEW as stated does not apply di­

wor l d - based . It is, however, the limit of world-based meth­
ods . (This is also true for the ot11er methods considered in
[BGH K92].) We can ea<;ily extend CEW so that it applies
to limits of world-ba<;ed methods by taking limits in the
obvious way. In particular, we define
CEW( Pr':;;;; H 'f' I K B )

observation that the distri bution that minimizes the cross­

maximum entropy is playing a different role. It is being used here
to extend rnndom worlds rather than to characterize properties of
random worlds as in [GHK92, PV89).

Generating New Beliefs from Old

would be to assume that, after conditioning, the a<>sertions
'if;; are independent. But, as we observed in the i ntroduction,
assuming independence is inappropriate in general .
Our solution is to first employ cross-en trop y to find appro­
priate probabi l i ti es for these atoms. We proceed as follows.
Suppose I is an arbitrary i n feren c e process, 1313 E C f1a t ,
and 1/J1 , . . . , 1/Jk are the formulas that appear in subexpres­
sions of the form Pr( 'if;) in B B . We form the K = 2k at oms
generated by the 'if;; , de no ting them by A 1 , . . . , A K . Con ­
sider the probab i l ity Jl defin ed on the space of atoms via
t-t(Aj ) = I(Aj [ KB ) .7 There is an obvious way of defining
whether the formula B B is satisfied by a probability distri­
bution on the atoms A 1 , . . . , Ak (we defer t11e formal details
to the full paper), but i n gen eral B B will not be sat isfied by
the distribu tion 11. For a si mpl e example, if we take the
in ference procedure to be random worlds and consider the
knowledge base KBb;nJA(Pr(Red(b)) = 0 . 8 ) from the intro­
duction, it turns out that P1-: ( Red ( b ) [ K B ,;,-d ) is around 0 . 5 7 .
Clearly, the di stri bu tio n 11 such that p.(Red( b ) ) i s around
0.57 does not satisfy t11e constraint Pr(Red( b ) ) = 0 . 8 . Let
Jl' be the probability d i stribution over the atoms that mini­
mizes cross-entropy relative to p among those t hat satisfy
BB, provided tl1ere is a unique such distribution. We then
define

Both CEW and CEF use cross-entropy. However, t h e two
applicatio ns are quite different. In the cm;e of CEW, we
apply cro ss- en trop y witl1 respect to probabi lity di s t ri bu ­
tions over pos si ble worlds, whereas with CEE we apply i t
to probabi lity distributions over formulas. Nevert hel e ss , as
we mentioned in the i n trod u c ti o n , there is a tight connection

between the approaches, since any probahi l i t y distri bution
over worlds defines a proba bi l i t y distribution over fonn u ­

typical ly ru·ises only in pathological examples. In fact, as
we show in Theorem 3 .8, there is an i mportan t class of cases
where the existence of CEF(Pr:; ) g u arant ees that of Pr�F.
Suppose KB is [[Fly( x ) [Bird(x)[[ r �

Pr(Red( Tweety) = 1 ) . Then , just as we would expect,
Pr�,"'(Red( lll'eet v) [ KB 1\ BB) = 1 . On the other hand,
CEF( P1�.,: ) (Red( 1\veety ) [ KB A BB) is undefined. To see
why, let ;t be the probabi lity distribution on the four atoms
ucfineu by Fly( 7\veery) and Red ( Tweety) determined by
Pts-:;:: ( · I K B ) . S i nce Pts� ( Fly( Tweety)IKB) = I , it must

Thus, there is not a

The last method we consider, RS, i s based on t he intu­

from statistical statements. This general idea goes hack to
work in Ule field of statistical mechanics [LanRO), whe re
it has been applied to the problem of reasoning abou t the
total energy of physical systems. If the system consi sts of
many particles then what is, in essence, a random-worlds
analysis can be appropriate. If the energy of the system is
known exactly no conceptual problem arises: some possibl e
configurations have the specified energy, while others are
impossible because they do not. H owever it turns out that i t
is frequently more appropriate to assume that all we know i s
the expected energy. Unfortunately, i t questionable whether

analogous to that which motivated our paper. Like us, one
response they have con si dered is to modify the assump­
t i o n of unifonn probability and move to maximum entropy
(thus u si n g essent i al l y, an in st ance of our CEW applied to
a uniform prior). But another response is the fol lowing.
Ph ysi cal l y, expected energy is appropriate for systems in
th ermal equilibrium (i e , at a con stant temperature). But
in practice this means Ulat Ule s yste m is in Ulennal contact
with a (general l y much larger) system, sometimes called a
heat bath. So another approach is to model the system of
i n teres t a> being part of a much larger system, including
the h e a t bath, whose total energy is truly fixed. On Ulis
l arger scale, random-worlds is on ce again applicable. B y
ch oosi ng the energy for the total system appropriately, Ule
ex pec t ed energy of the sm all subsystem will be as speci­
fied . Hence. we have converted s u bjective statements into
objective ones, so that we are able to u se our standard tech­
niques. In this domain, there is a clear physical intuition
for the con nec t i on between t11e objective infonnation (Ule
