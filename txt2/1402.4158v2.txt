In the past few decades, many computational efforts have been devoted to simulate Euler
or Navier-Stokes equations in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Many of classical numerical methods for Navier-Stokes equations involve solving convection and viscous
terms separately on one set of computational grid. For the nonlinear convection term, the
design of numerical fluxes at element interfaces is crucial to the success of numerical algorithms. Various approximate Riemann solvers have been proposed to approximate the wave
structure of exact Riemann solutions, e.g. Godunov scheme [9], the approximate Riemann
solvers due to Roe [30], Osher [29], Harten, Lax and van Leer [11], etc. For a summary on this
topic, see [33]. For the viscous diffusion term, central difference method is often used. Another approach is to design fluxes at cell interfaces based on integrating particle distribution
function in the phase space at kinetic scale. The kinetic flux vector splitting method for the
Euler equations (KFVS-Euler) based on the collisionless Boltzmann equation is introduced
in [25]. When viscous effect is considered, the particle distribution function contains both
equilibrium (Maxwellian) and nonequilibrium parts of the gas flow; the inviscid and viscous
terms can be treated simultaneously. For example, the kinetic flux vector splitting method
for Navier-Stokes equations (KFVS-NS) was developed by introducing the nonequilibrium
term in particle distribution obtained by Chapman-Enskog expansion in [4]; the gas-kinetic
BGK method for Navier-Stokes equations (BGK-NS) was introduced in [40, 36].
To improve the performance of numerical schemes, high order schemes are introduced
in 80’s and underwent great development since then. For example, in the finite volume or
finite difference framework, there are the second order MUSCL scheme [34], the essentially
2

non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme [10] and the weighted ENO (WENO) scheme [19, 12]. The
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, as a class of finite element methods, has been very
popular in the CFD community [7, 1, 8]. The high-order accuracy of DG is achieved by using
high-order polynomial approximations within each element, where more than one degrees of
freedom per element are stored and updated. The DG method has been well-known for its
flexibility, h-p adaptivity, compactness and high parallel efficiency [5]. There have been many
work in existing literatures in improving the BGK-NS method to be of high order accurate by
interpolations or reconstructions such as WENO [24], by piecewise parabolic reconstruction
of high order BGK fluxes [16], and by the DG framework [37, 18, 28]. These methods have
been successfully applied in many engineering problems, such as the hypersonic viscous and
heat conducting flows [15, 39, 17], 3D transonic flow [26], among many others. Comparisons between the schemes with approximate Riemann solvers and the particle distribution
functions of the Boltzmann equation are provided in [24, 14].
The central scheme uses staggered meshes to avoid solving Riemann problems at cell interfaces and provides a black box solution to nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws [27, 13].
Liu [20] introduced central schemes based on two sets of overlapping meshes. Taking advantages of the redundant representation of the solution on overlapping meshes, approximate
Riemann solvers are not needed at cell interfaces, and the high order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods can be directly applied by the method of lines
approach. Following similar spirit, central DG (CDG) methods are proposed and developed
for hyperbolic equations in [21], and central local DG methods are proposed for diffusion
equations in [23].
We propose to couple the CDG framework [21] with the BGK-NS method [36] for NavierStokes simulations. Compared with the DG BGK methods [37, 18, 28], CDG methods
evolve two pieces of approximate solutions defined on two sets of overlapping meshes. Such
redundant representation of numerical solution offers great convenience in the design of
gas-kinetic BGK fluxes. Specifically, the evaluation of fluxes at cell interfaces of one set of
computational mesh is right inside a cell of the staggered mesh (i.e. continuous regions of the
solution at the staggered mesh). Hence, the particle distribution function, without involving
two different Maxwellian distributions from the left and right states and the corresponding

3

equilibrium state, is much simpler than existing gas-kinetic BGK methods [36, 37, 18, 28].
One of the key components that contributes to the success of the gas-kinetic BGK scheme [36]
is the exact time evolution of the BGK equation along characteristics; such mechanism,
despite its rather complicated formulation, brings the distribution function at cell interfaces
to the equilibrium state in a very effective way. In the CDG framework, since the distribution
function is continuous (at the interior of the other set of solution), such exact evolution is
not as crucial. In our scheme, the method of lines approach is adopted; a third-order TVD
RK method is used for temporal discretization. As the central scheme, the proposed CDGBGK has doubled the memory requirement, since two sets of solutions have to be stored
and updated simultaneously; on the other hand, for the convection part, the CFL time step
constraint of the CDG method for numerical stability is relatively large compared with that
for the DG method. The numerical boundary conditions have to be treated with special care.
For example, a class of DG basis functions that preserves the given boundary condition, in
the spirit of [6], are proposed for the wall boundary condition.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose the CDG-BGK method
for one and two dimensional problems. The BGK fluxes, as well as numerical boundary
conditions are discussed in details. In Section 3, following the pioneering work of [36, 18],
extensive numerical results are demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. We conclude the paper in Section 4.

CDG-BGK method for compressible Navier-Stokes
equations

In this section, we first introduce a 1D BGK model and the corresponding macroscopic
conservative Navier-Stokes equations in Section 2.1. We propose to use the central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) spatial discretization [20] coupled with a third-order total variation
diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta (RK) temporal discretization [32] for solving the 1D NavierStokes equations in Section 2.2. The BGK type flux for both convection and viscous terms
will be described in Section 2.3 and extension to two-dimensional cases will be presented in
Section 2.4. Finally we discuss the numerical boundary conditions in Section 2.5.

2.1

The 1D BGK model and Navier-Stokes equations

The integro-differential kinetic Boltzmann equation is commonly used to describe the evolution of the particle distribution function. To avoid the complicated bilinear collisional
operator of the Boltzmann equation, a simplified BGK model was proposed by Bhatnagar et
al. [2]. The BGK collisional operator is known to preserve the collisional invariant properties
of mass, momentum and energy, as well as the entropy dissipation property.
For a 1D flow, the BGK model can be written as [36]
ft + ufx =

g−f
,
τ

(2.1)

where τ is the particle collision time, f (x, t, u, ξ) is an unknown function of space variable
x, time variable t, particle velocity u and internal variables ξ. ξ is taking into account
to describe the internal motions, such as rotation and vibration [35]. g(x, t, u, ξ) is the
Maxwellian distribution given by

Remark 2.1. The kinetic flux function G in equation (2.8) encompasses both the convection
and diffusion terms in the macroscopic Navier-Stokes system (2.10) with the approximation
to the f function by equation (2.9). The convection term in the Navier-Stokes system (2.10)
is due to the contribution from the Maxwellian function g in (2.9), while the diffusion term
is due to the O(τ ) term in equation (2.9).

2.2

The RK CDG method

We propose to use the RK CDG method [21] to solve equation (2.7). The CDG method
evolves two sets of approximate solutions defined on overlapping cells. Compared with the
DG method, the CDG method does not need a numerical flux at the cell interface. The
evaluation of the flux at the interface of one cell is right inside a cell of the other staggered
cells. The CDG method uses the flux function of the solution at the staggered cells, which
has no ambiguous values there. This is convenient for us to define the BGK flux in the next
subsection. In the following, we first follow [21] to describe the CDG method.
i=N
We first consider a 1D domain [0, L] with a partition of {xi }i=1
. Denote xi+ 1 = 12 (xi +
2

xi+1 ), and let Ii = [xi− 1 , xi+ 1 ] and Ii+ 1 = [xi , xi+1 ] be two sets of overlapping cells. Two
2

2

2

discrete spaces associated with the overlapping cells Ii and Ii+ 1 are defined as
2

Zh = Zkh = {z : each of its 3 components z|Ii ∈ P k (Ii ), ∀i},
Wh = Whk = {z : each of its 3 components z|Ii+ 1 ∈ P k (Ii+ 1 ), ∀i},
2

2

where the local space P k (I) consists of polynomials of degree at most k on I.
The semi-discrete CDG method for solving (2.7) is given as follows: find two sets of
approximate solutions WhZ ∈ Zh and WhW ∈ Wh , such that for any ηh ∈ Zh , ζh ∈ Wh and

where x±
i are the right and left limits at the point xi . Here, the operations for vectors
are in the component-wise sense [7]. ∆τ n is the maximum time step determined by the
CFL condition, the specification of which can be found at the beginning of Section 3. The
first terms on the right side of equations (2.12) and (2.13) are used to remove its O(1/∆t)
dependency of numerical dissipation [21].
We focus our discussions on the approximate solution WhZ on cell Ii . It can be expressed
as
WhZ (x, t)

=

k
X

WiZ,l (t)ηil (x),

(2.14)

l=0

where {ηil } is a basis function of P k (Ii ). For example, the Legendre polynomials are a local

orthogonal basis of P k (Ii ). In the 1D case, ηi0 = 1, ηi1 = ( ∆x
), ηi2 = ( ∆x
) − 13 ,. . ., where
i /2
i /2

∆xi = xi+1/2 − xi−1/2 . The approximate solution WhW on cell Ii+ 1 can be defined similarly.
2

The fluxes G at the cell interfaces and the integrals on the right side of equations (2.12) and
(2.13) are calculated by the gas-kinetic formulation presented in next section. The integrals
on the right side of equation (2.12) contain solutions WhW , WhZ , which are continuous over two
subintervals [xi− 1 , xi ] and [xi , xi+ 1 ]. These integrals are computed by Gaussian quadrature
2

2

rules on each of the subinterval. Similar comments apply for the integral on the right hand
side of equation (2.13). If the solutions are discontinuous, the TVB limiter proposed by
Cockburn and Shu [7] will be used to eliminate spurious oscillations and enforce the stability.
In this paper, we use a method of lines RK method for temporal discretization. Let
Wh = (WhZ , WhW ), the third order TVD RK time discretization [31] for equations (2.12)
and (2.13) is the following,
(1)

Wh = Whn + ∆tn Lh (Whn ),

where ∆tn = θ∆τ n is the current time step with θ ∈ (0, 1] and Lh (Wh ) is the spatial
operators on the right side of the semi-discrete equations (2.12) and (2.13).
Remark 2.2. For the third-order TVD RK method (2.15), the CDG method has a little
larger CFL number than the DG method for convection part, e.g., the CFL numbers of the
8

CDG method are 0.58, 0.33, 0.22, while the CFL numbers of the DG method are 0.4, 0.2, 0.13,
for P 1 , P 2 , P 3 respectively [22].

2.3

The BGK flux

In this section, we describe how to evaluate the vector G from the BGK model for the
CDG method in equations (2.12)-(2.13). As pointed out in Remark 2.1, both convection and
viscous terms in Navier-Stokes equations (2.10) comes from the vector G, the evaluation of
which mimics the Chapman-Enskog expansion [3]. Below, we provide a brief review of the
existing algorithm in numerically approximating the BGK flux for the gas-kinetic scheme
in the finite volume framework [36], with some of the ideas originally developed in [40, 35].
Further development of such schemes in the DG framework could be found in [37, 18, 28].
We note that it is very difficult to completely describe the BGK gas-kinetic scheme, hence
we only outline main steps with intuition below, but refer readers to the original manuscript
[36] for technical details.

be performed analytically.
Proposed CDG-BGK method. We propose to use the CDG method for spatial discretization with the BGK flux for convection and diffusion terms in the Navier-Stokes system. In
the CDG framework, two pieces of approximate solutions defined on overlapping cells are
evolved. Since the cell interface on one set of cell is right inside a cell of the staggered cells,
the solution at the staggered cell is continuous for flux evaluation without ambiguity, and
we have
g l = g r = g0 ,

al = ar = a,

Al = Ar = A,

(2.26)

in equation (2.19). In other words, the before-collision and after-collision equilibrium states
are the same. Due to this fact, the use of exact time evolution formula (2.18) is not as crucial.
11

Therefore, we propose to use the third-order explicit TVD RK method for time evolution by
the method of lines approach. Below we describe in details several numerical approximations
needed for the proposed CDG-BGK method. They are, in some sense, special cases for the
BGK scheme reviewed above.
Approximation of the distribution function f . The particle distribution function f at any
spatial location x and time t is approximated by
f (x, t, u, ξ) = g [1 − τ (au + A)] .

(2.27)

where g = g(x, t, u, ξ) is the Maxwellian distribution (2.2) at time t. Similar to equations
(2.21) and (2.22), a is related to the spatial slope of g in the form of

The moments evaluation of the Maxwellian distribution function are provided in Appendix A.1.
Remark 2.3. Although the derivation of the numerical flux functions G comes from the
kinetic BGK formulation, the integration in the phase space is done analytically as in Appendix A.1. The actual implementation is at the level of macroscopic variables. Hence, the
computational cost is on the same scale of other existing Navier-Stokes solvers. The same
comments apply to the gas-kinetic BGK scheme in [36].
Remark 2.4. The BGK model corresponds to a unit Prandtl number P r. For a variable

Remark 2.5. In equation (2.29), the spatial derivative is directly taken on the CDG polynomials. It would lead to a k th order scheme with P k polynomial space for viscous flow
simulations (not the optimal (k + 1)th order). For convection dominated problems, the accuracy would still be (k + 1)th order. Such fact is verified in our numerical results in Section 3.

Extension to two-dimensional cases

In this subsection, we extend the proposed CDG-BGK method in previous subsections to
two-dimensional cases. The 2D BGK model can be written as
ft + ufx + vfy =

g−f
,
τ

(2.38)

where f (x, y, t, u, v, ξ) is the particle distribution function of space variables x, y, time
variable t, particle velocities u, v and internal variables ξ. While g(x, y, t, u, v, ξ) is the
Maxwellian distribution given by

2
x, y directions, |ξ|2 = ξ12 + ξ22 + . . . + ξK
with K being the total number of degrees of

freedom in ξ. Based on the conservative constraint condition (2.5), taking the moments
of ψ = (ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 )T = (1, u, v, 21 (u2 + v 2 + |ξ|2 ))T to equation (2.38), we can get the
following system of macroscopic conservative equation

and (2.44) are calculated by the gas-kinetic formulation presented below. Note that in 2D
case, the first two integrals on the right side of equation (2.43) contain four pieces of solutions
on four subcells, each of which is calculated by a 2D Gaussian quadrature rule. The rest
two integrals on the right side of equation (2.43) are associated with two pieces of solutions,
each of which is determined by a 1D Gaussian quadrature rule. Similar comments apply for
the integrals on the right side of equation (2.44).
In the following, we follow the spirit of 1D BGK scheme to propose the 2D strategy
for computing the fluxes G and H. The distribution function f in equation (2.38) can be
expressed as
f (x, y, tn , u, v, ξ) = g [1 − τ (au + bv + A)] ,

(2.46)

up to the first order of τ , where g = g(x, y, tn , u, v, ξ) is the Maxwellian distribution function (2.39) associated with the macroscopic variables (ρ, U, V, λ) at (x, y) on the dual mesh.
Similar to the 1D case, a, b are related to the spatial slopes of g in x, y directions respectively,

Numerical boundary conditions

For the numerical tests in this paper, we follow closely the examples in [36, 18], with similar
boundary conditions, e.g. inflow, outflow and wall boundary conditions. In the CDG method,
two sets of approximate solutions on overlapping cells are updated; thus numerical boundary
conditions are needed for both solutions. The inflow and outflow conditions can be treated,
in a similar manner as those in DG, for both solutions in the CDG method. The more
challenging case is the wall boundary conditions.
18

In the following, we take the Couette flow in a channel with the bottom wall fixed and
the top wall moving (see Section 3.2) as an example to describe the proposed numerical
no-slip boundary condition at both walls. Although the Couette flow is a 2D problem, it
can be implemented as a 1D problem since the solutions do not depend on x. We assume
the overlapping cells in the y-direction as plotted in Fig. 2.2 with the walls located at y0 and
y5 with y0 = 0, y5 = 5. Cells J0 = [y− 1 , y 1 ] and J5 = [y 9 , y 11 ] are cut through by the walls.

For the no-slip boundary condition at wall, the physical macroscopic velocities U, V are zero
on the wall. However, the numerical ones might not be zero due to numerical errors; such
non-zero errors might accumulated during long time evolution and eventually impact the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. We propose to enforce zero velocities at the numerical
level. For example, in cell J0 at the bottom wall, we adopt the following basis functions

Numerical examples

In this section, we present simulation results of the proposed CDG-BGK method for several
1D and 2D viscous flow problems. For comparison, most of the examples are taken from [36,

based on the CFL condition, while the time step in evolution is taken to be ∆tn = 0.9∆τ n

in the x direction and V − C, V, V, V + C in the y direction for convection part, where
p
C = γp/ρ is the speed of sound. CFLc and CFLd are the CFL numbers for the convection
and diffusion parts. In our numerical examples, for the third-order TVD Runge-Kutta
method (2.15), we take CFLc = 0.58, 0.33, 0.22 [22] and CFLd = 0.06, 0.01, 0.005 for P 1 ,
P 2 and P 3 solution spaces respectively. Our CFLd numbers are larger than those taken
in [23] for the central local DG method, yet they are working properly for all our numerical
examples. The Prandtl number modification (2.36) will be used in all numerical examples
except the laminar boundary layer case.

3.1

Accuracy test

We first solve the Navier-Stokes equations (2.7) with smooth solutions, where the initial
conditions are given by
ρ(x, t = 0) = 1 + 0.2 sin(πx),

U (x, t = 0) = 1,

p(x, t = 0) = 1.

(3.1)

The computational domain is [0, 2] with periodic boundary condition. Two different viscosity
coefficients are tested, µ = 0.00001 and µ = 0.1, corresponding to a convection-dominated
20

flow and a viscous flow, respectively. For this example, the Prandtl number is P r = 2/3
and the ratio of specific heats is γ = 5/3. We compute the solutions up to time t = 2.
TVB limiter is not used for this case. Since the exact solution is not available for this
problem, the numerical errors and orders of density ρ are computed by comparing to the
reference solution
which is obtained
by the P 3 solution space with 1280 cells. Here we take

The results are shown in Table 3.1. (k + 1)th -order convergent rate can be observed for the

convergent rate for even k and (k + 1)th -order convergent rate for odd k can be observed for
the solution with µ = 0.1 and P k solution spaces.

3.2

Couette flow

In the second example, we consider the couette flow in a channel of height H, with the bottom
wall fixed and the top wall moving at a constant speed U1 in the horizontal direction. We
assume isothermal boundary condition at the bottom and top walls with temperature being
T0 and T1 respectively. If the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients µ and κq are constant,
an analytical solution for the steady state temperature distribution can be obtained, that is

where the Eckert number is Ec = U12 /(Cp (T1 − T0 )). Cp is the heat capacity at a constant
pressure, for a monatomic gas Cp = 25 R and for a diatomic gas Cp = 72 R.
The solution of this problem does not depend on x, hence we solve it as a reduced 1D
problem from equation (2.41) in the y direction, that is,
Wt + Hy = 0,
i.e. the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (2.42) without the x-derivative term.
We take the computational domain to be [0, 5] (H = 5) and divided by 5 cells with cell
size ∆y = 1. The isothermal no-slip boundary condition with pressure gradient being zero
in y direction is used on the bottom and top walls [36]. Here we consider the temperature λ0
and λ1 at the boundaries with different ratios of specific heats γ = 5/3, 7/5, different Prandtl

numbers P r = 0.72, 1.0 and different Eckert numbers Ec = 10, 50. For specific settings, see
Table 3.2. We take U1 = 0.1 and µ = 0.1. The initial conditions are
ρ(y, t = 0) = 1,

U (y, t = 0) = 0.1,

V (y, t = 0) = 0,

M (y, t = 0) = 0.1,

where M = U/C is the Mach number.
The results with different boundary settings are shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2. The Prandtl
number modification (2.36) is used in P r = 0.72 cases. From the figures, we can see that: (1)
numerical results match the analytical solutions very well with different parameters even on
such a coarse numerical cell; (2) the implementation of the Prandtl number modification is
needed compared with the analytical solutions and (3) P 2 solution space gives more accurate
results than P 1 solution space with the same cell size. Numerical errors and orders of convergence to analytical solutions are summarized in Table 3.3. Roughly k th order convergent
rate is observed for the method with P k polynomial space.

Navier-Stokes shock structure

Now we consider the shock structure problem for a monatomic gas by solving the NavierStokes equations (2.7). γ = 5/3 and the dynamical viscosity coefficient is µ = µ−∞ (T /T−∞ )0.8 ,

−∞ and ∞ denote the values at the upstream and downsteam respectively. The dynamical
viscosity coefficient at the upstream keeps to be a constant µ−∞ = 0.0005. The collision time
τ in the BGK model is local via the relationship τ = µ/p in each cell. The Mach number
M = 1.5 at the upstream and the Prandtl number P r = 2/3. The initial conditions are

For this problem, the shock would not arrive at the left or right boundary. Hence, we
can impose the boundary condition as the constant left and right states. The reference
solution can be obtained by integrating the steady state Navier-Stokes equations, with the
corresponding Matlab programs available in Appendix C of [36].
The computational domain is [−0.1, 0.1] and the cell size ∆x = 1/800 for both P 1 and
P 2 cases. TVB limiter is used for this example. The results are presented in Fig. 3.3. In the
figures, the normal stress and the heat flux are defined to be

From these results, we can see that the shock structure is captured well with a reasonable

number of grid points. The difference between the results from P 1 and P 2 cases are very
small.

3.4

Shock tube problem

In the fourth example, the Sod problem is tested by solving the Navier-Stokes equations (2.7)
with γ = 1.4 and P r = 2/3. The computational domain is [−0.5, 0.5] with the cell size
∆x = 1/200, and ∆tn = 0.5∆τ n in this case. TVB limiter is used for this example. The
initial conditions are

(
(1, 0, 1),
(ρ, U, p) =
(0.125, 0, 0.1),

x ≤ 0,
x > 0.

(3.3)

We compute the solutions up to time t = 0.2. Similar to shock structure case, we can impose
the boundary condition as the constant left and right states. In Fig. 3.4, we show the results
√
with a kinematic viscosity coefficient ν = µ/ρ = 0.0005/(ρ λ). The solid lines are the
reference solutions computed on a much refined cell size ∆x = 1/1200 with P 2 solution
space. Both the shock and the contact discontinuity are captured well. From the zoom-in
Fig. 3.5, we can see the P 2 case gives slightly better results than the P 1 case. The results
√
with a smaller viscosity coefficient ν = µ/ρ = 0.00005/(ρ λ) are presented in Fig. 3.6. The
CDG-BGK method can capture the sharp discontinuity.

3.5

Laminar boundary layer

The last example is the 2D laminar boundary layer problem over a flat plate and we solve
the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (2.41). The wall starts from x = 0 with a length of L = 3
at y = 0. A uniform rectangular mesh with 480 × 120 cells is used on the computational
domain [−1, 3] × [0, 1]. The initial conditions are set to be
ρ−∞ = ρ(x, y, t = 0) = 1,

U−∞ = U (x, y, t = 0) = 1,

V (x, y, t = 0) = 0,

M (x, y, t = 0) = 0.2.

We take γ = 1.4, P r = 1, and λ−∞ = λ(x, y, t = 0) = γM 2 /2. The kinematic viscosity
coefficient is ν = 3 × 10−4 . The Reynolds number based on the upstream flow states and the
length L is Re =

LU−∞
ν

= 104 . No limiter is used in this case. The no-slip adiabatic boundary

condition is imposed on the flat plate. Mirror-symmetric boundary condition is used for the
other part of the bottom boundary. On the left and top boundaries, the non-reflective
boundary condition is used, which is based on the Riemann invariants. For example, on the
left boundary, let (ρ1 , U1 , p1 ) be the macroscopic density, velocity and pressure right inside
the computation domain adjacent to the left boundary and (ρ0 , U0 , p0 ) be the values on the
ghost cell correspondingly, we have

the top boundary. A first order extrapolation of cell average of the conservative variables is
used at the right boundary.
In Fig. 3.7, we show the P 1 solution of the velocity U in the x direction. The nondimensional velocity U/U−∞ at location x = 0.5 and x = 1 for both P 1 and P 2 cases
are shown in Fig. 3.8, which are compared to the Blasius solution. In the plots, η =
p
y U−∞ /(νx), and we can see that the scheme with the P 2 solution space performs slightly
better than that with the P 1 solution space.

Conclusion

In this paper, a novel CDG-BGK method for viscous flow simulations is proposed. The
new scheme inherits several merits from both the CDG framework and the gas-kinetic BGK
schemes. The fluxes in the BGK method is based on the particle transport and collisional
mechanism via the gas-kinetic BGK model. Such fluxes take into account of both the convective and viscous terms, due to the intrinsic connection between the gas-kinetic BGK model
and the Navier-Stokes equations. The CDG method evolves two pieces of approximate solutions defined on overlapping meshes. The cell interfaces of one computational mesh are
inside the staggered mesh, hence the fluxes are in the continuous region of the staggered
solution. For the CDG-BGK method, the distribution function in the interior of elements
is continuous and is much easier to evaluate than existing finite volume or DG BGK methods. Numerical results in 1D and 2D illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed
CDG-BGK scheme.
