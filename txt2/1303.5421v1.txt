here describe how the probabil ity tables are modifi ed
in the adaptation process.
So, consider a causal probabilistic network into which
information on the state of the variables can be en­
t ered
If the state of only some of the variables is
known, then the probability distributions for the re­
maining variables are calculated. Each time this is
done, we have described a case. Now, a large number
of cases is at hand, an d we want to improve the model

by adjusting the conditional probability tables to the
set of cases.

Direct modelling of table uncertRinty

In Fig u re 1 ( a ) , the state of the variable A is influenced
direct ly by the states of B and C, and the strength

of this influence is modelled by P(AIB, C). If the
this may, for exam­
stren gth is subject to doubt
ple, be due to d ifferent estimates from experts, or it
may be due to a context influence not mod elled (like
soil quality of corn fields or ge ne t i c disposition for a
disease)
then this doubt may be modelled directly
by introducing an extra parent, T, for A ( F igu re 1
( b)) . This variable can be c onsi d e r ed as a ty pe vari­
able modelling, for example, types of context or differ­
ent experts' assessments. To reflect credibility of the
experts or frequencies of the co ntext types, a prior dis­

to the CPN, the calculation of updated probabilities
will yield a new distribution on T, an d we may say that
the change of these probabi litie s reflects what we have
learnt from the case. This process is called retrieval
of experience. The new dist ri bution may now be used
as prior probabilities for the next case and its impact
on the conditional probabilities found by summing out
the type variable. This process is called dzssemination
of experience. The technique has, for example, been
used in Andreassen et al. (199la), where the system
con tain s a model for metab ol i sm in patients suffering
from diabetes. Through a type variable, the syst em
adapts to the characteristics of the individual patient.

Hence v; is a measure of the uncertainty of the prob­

Using this interpretation we also have a tool to model
expert opinion s of the type "the probability is some­
where between p and q, but I believe it is about 1·" . In
the case of two states a and b, consider, for example,
the statement that the probability of a is between 0.3
an d 0.4 and that it is about .35. If we, as in Spiegel­
halter et al. ( 1990), interpret the statement so that
the mean is 0.35 and the standard deviation is 0.05,
then it can be modelled by a 2-dimensional Dirichlet­
distribution (which is called a Beta-distribution). We
then have to determine two counts na an d Ob whi ch

which we solve to get Oa = 31.5 and Ob = 58.5. This
can be an attractive alternative to modelling second
order u n certainty by intervals of lower and upper prob­
abilities.
learning: Let (m1, . . . , mn) and a sample size
s be a given specification of the conditional probabil­
ity table P(Aib, c) . We can then act as if we had a
contingency table of counts (sm1, .. . , smn)· lf we ge t
a case in the configuration (b, c ) and a;, then retrieval
qu ite simply consist in adding 1 to the count for a;,
and dissemination is just to calculate the new frequen­
cies. If global and local independence can be assumed
the scheme is applicable to all tables.
Back to

The scheme only works if both the states of A an d its
parents are known. In general we may anticipate that
the provided evidence, E, may leave uncertainty on
both the states of A and of its parents.
A nai ve approach in the general case could be to add a
count of P( a;, b, cl E) to the counts for a;. This scheme
is known as fractional updating (Titterington 1976).
However, the scheme has several drawbacks. For ex­
ample, if P(A I b, c) = P(A I E) then the scheme may
give unjustified counts yielding a false accuracy. If, for
example, E = (b, c), then nothing can be learned on
the distribution of A, but nevertheless the sample size
will be increased by one. See further discussion of this
issue in Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen (1990a) as well as
in Spiegelhalter and Cowell (1992).
A mathematically correct updating of the distribu­
tions under our interpretation results in a mixture of
Dirichlet-distributions rather than in a si ngl e one (a
mixture is a linear combination with non-negative co­
efficients summing to 1). This complicates the calcu­
lations intractably - in particular when adapting from
the next case where mixtures of Dirichlet-distributions
are to be updated. Eventually the process will yet

agam result in a combinatorial explosion. Instead,
the correct distribution is approximated by a single
Dirichlet-distribution (keeping the approach of modi­
fying counts). First of all, we want the approximated
distribution to have the correct means, and the new set
of probabilities (mj, ... , m;) is set to be the means of
the correct distribution. Secondly, it would be prefer­
able also to give the distrihu t.ion t.he c orrect varian cPs.
However, this is not possible since only one free parant­
eter is left, namely the equivalent sam ple size. Instead,
the equivalent sample size is give n a value such t.h<-tt.

Features of aHUGIN

The program a ii U G IN , wltich is currently 1111der int­
plementation, is an ex t.cnsion of II U GIN (A nders<'n
et at. 1989). JIUGIN is a shell which allows the user
to edit CPNs over finit.e st.at.c variahlcs, and wh en t.ll<'
CPN is specified, TIUG!N creates <1. runtime sysl<'llt
for entering findings and ttpd<�t.inr; prohahilit.i<�s of tlw
variables in the network.
In aiJUGIN each variable lllilY be declared t.o be in
adaptation mode. If, for cx<�mplc, the variab le A with
states a1, . . . , an has parents B, . . . , C, th e n the con·
ditiona! probability table P( A I B, . .. , C) is modified
by declaring A of ndapt.at.ion t.y p e . The t.ahle is i n ­
terpreted as a contingency table such that for ead1
parent configuration b, .. . , c, the set P(Ajb, ... , c) is
interpreted as a set of frequencies based on a sampl e
of cases. Therefore the user will for each p arent config­
uration be prompted t.o specify F:QUIVALENT SAMPLE
SIZE. The l arger the ESS, t.hc more conservative t.hc
adaptation will be. The default val l !!! of ESS is Gk·,
where k is the number of states in 11.

lated to sample sizes using the equivalent of (3). The
ESS used for the given parent configur at io n will now
be chosen as the minimum of the t r anslate d sam p le
sizes for the individual entries .
3.1

Fading

Variables in ada p tati on mode have an extra feature,
fading, which makes them tend to ignore th in gs they
have learnt a long time ago, considering them as less
relevant. Each time a new case is taken into account,
the equivalent sample si ze is discounted by a fading
factor q, which is a re al number less than one but typ­
ically close to one. From the expression ( 1) for the
Dirichlet density, it is seen that the fading scheme es­
sentially corresponds to flattening the density by r ais­
ing it to the power q, known as power-steady d ynamic
modelling (Smith 1979; Smith 1981).

fading the EQUIVALENT SAMPLE SlZE is kept but the
MAXIMAL SAMPLE SIZE provided by the user

If s is the initial ESS, then the maximal ESS after
adaptation from a case is qs + 1. Running n cases will
result in a maximal ESS of
1- q"
q"s + ---

1- q

This gives that 1/(1 - q) is the maximal sam ple size
in the long run.
Therefore the user is given the choice between ACCU­
MULATING (fading factor 1) and FADING. If fa din g is
selected, the user is prompted for MAXIMAL SAMPLE
SIZE, MSS, and the fading factor is then computed as
(MSS- 1)/MSS. Defau lt value is lOOm, w h e re m is the
number of entries in the table.
Note: The result of fad in g is not only that the sample

size is reduced. Consider namely an entry with count
a- and with samp le size s, an d suppose that ret r ie va l of
a case results in an increase of the sample size by 1 and
o f the count by x. Without fading the ratio between
counts from present and past is x ( a-, but with fading
the ratio is xjqa-. This tells us that with fading the

present counts are given more weight. This can also be
seen by assuming that the entry wilt never receive more
counts. Without fadi n g the p roba bili ty will vanis h at
the speed of a-f(s + n ) while wi th fadi ng, the speed of
vanishing is in the order of a-f(s + q-").

These experiments are very similar to those performed

by Spie gelhalter and Cowell (1992). However, we al­
low uncertainty on all conditional probability tables.
In general our results show the same pattern. For com­

plete data the correct values are obtained quite fast,
and the influence of the initial specifications vanishes
after a f e w hundred cases.
Figures 3 {a) and 4 (a) show an interesting phe­

nomenon w h en learning from incomplete data ( 02).
In these experiments, it can only be observed from t he
given data that a maj ori ty of smokers suffer f rom dys­
pnoea (shortness of breath). It can not be inferred
f rom the data whether this correlation is due to the
presence or absence of bronchitis. In the fi rst exper­
iment, where all variables are in accumulating mode,
th e frequency of bronchitis is overestimated (Figure 3
(a)). To compensate for th is , the condition al pr oba­
bility for dy spn oe a given bronchitis and none of the
other diseases, is underestimated ( F igure 4(a)). Thus
t he correlation b etw een what can a ct u ally be observed
in the data is determined correctly, but the intermedi­
ate expl an ation is slightly incorrect.
From these experiments we conclude, not su rpri singly ,
that the method has difficulties learning about con­

ce pts on which dat a are indirect. In such situations the
system rel ies str ongly on p ri or k nowledge . This con­
clusion was also reached by Spiegelhalter and Cowell

(1992).

aHUGIN: A System Creating Adaptive Causal Probabilistic Networks

To s u mmarize, aH U G I N seems to be able to adapt
to chang i n g environments, thereby extending H U G I N
with a valuable fun ctional i ty . Howeve r , special atten­
tion must be directed to the choice of M SS and to
var i ables with systematically missing d ata.
