which includes both theoretical and experimental results,
has concentrated mostly on batch learning methods. In
this setting, the total corpus of data is fully available to the
learning algorithm which outputs a model after multiple
inspections of the data.
In this paper we study the problem of sequential update of
Bayesian networks. This problem is different from batch
learning in two aspects: (I) the learning procedure receives
the data as a "read-once" stream of observations, and (2)
the learning procedure has to output a model, based on the
observations seen so far, at various time points (possibly
after each observation is made).
Sequential update is a crucial capability for building adapt-

able systems that can overcome errors in their initial model,
and that can adapt to changes in the underlying distribu­
tion. We are especially interested in sequential update in
situations where the learning procedure cannot store all of
the past observations (or a complete summary of it) in main
memory. Examples of such situations include monitoring
systems which collect data over extended periods of time
or embedded systems with limited memory capabilities.
Memory constraints also arise in data mining applications
that usually involve massive amount of data that must be
kept on secondary storage. In these applications repeated
inspection of the data is infeasible.
We claim that effective sequential update of structure in­
volves a tradeoff between the quality of the learned net­
works and the amount of information that is maintained
about past observations. We consider three approaches to
sequential update. Two of these approaches lie on the ex­
tremes of the spectrum. The third approach, which is new,
allows for a flexible manipulation of the tradeoff.
The naive approach stores all the previously seen data, and
repeatedly invokes a batch learning procedure after each
new datum is recorded. This approach can use all of the
information provided so far, and thus is essentially optimal
in terms of the quality of the networks it can induce. This
approach, however, requires vast amount of memory to store
the entire corpus of data. 1
We can attempt to avoid the overhead of storing all of the
previously seen data instances by summarizing them using
the model we have learned so far. This approach essentially
assumes that the set of data instances being summarized are
distributed according to the probability measure described
by the current model. This approach, which we call MAP
(for reasons that will become clear in Section 3.1), is space­
efficient. Unfortunately, by using the current model as a
summary of past data, we strongly bias our learning proce­
dure towards that model. As a result, after some number of
iterations, this approach locks itself into a particular model
and stops adapting to new data.

10f course, it suffices to keep counts of the number of times

each distinct case was observed so far. This, however, is also
impractical, since the number of distinct cases is exponential in

the number of variables of interest.

Moreover, it allows flexible

choices in the tradeoff between space and quality of the
induced networks. The incremental approach interleaves
steps in a search process, to find "good" models, with the
incorporation of new data. This approach focuses its re­
sources on keeping track of just enough information to
make the next decision in the search process. The basic
strategy is to maintain a set of network candidates that are

on the

frontier

of this process.

This set contains all of

the networks that are deemed most promising at the cur­
rent time. The procedure also keeps track of the required
information needed for evaluating candidates on the fron­
tier. As we shall see, this information can be maintained
in a space-efficient manner. As each new data case arrives,
the procedure updates the information stored in memory,
and invokes the search process to check whether one of the
networks in the frontier is deemed more suitable than the
current model. (We always assume that the current network
is on the frontier.) If this is the case, it adopts the new model
as current model, and updates the search frontier. As we
shall see, the amount of space required by the procedure is
related to the size of the search frontier.
The dynamics in the recording of information about the
data raises a fundamental question with respect to the scor­
ing functions commonly used to evaluate different models.
All of the scoring functions proposed in the literature as­
sume that alternative candidates are evaluated with respect
to the same training data. In the incremental learning pro­
cedure, however, we can start recording the information for
different candidates at different times. We propose mod­
ifications to the MDL score and the Bayesian score that
deal with this complication. We empirically evaluate these
"extended" scoring functions in conjunction with the incre­
mental learning procedure.

common approach to this problem is to introduce a scoring
function (or a

score)

that evaluates the "fitness" of net­

works with respect to the training data, and then to search
for the best network (according to this score).

The two

main scoring functions commonly used to learn Bayesian
networks are the Bayesian score [3,

with incomplete data in sequential update. To this end,
we propose a combination of two generalizations of the

values of X (from now on, we omit the superscript and the

We call the vector Nx the sufficient statistics of X. As it
turns out, we the optimal choice of parameters Bx,lpa{X;)
is a function of Nx,,pa(X;); see, for example, [7]. Since
the selection of parameters has a closed form, we can focus
on choosing the best structure G for the network. The
parameters are then easily computed from these sufficient
statistics.

'D'
such that N'D

this particular family will be the same. The direct benefit of
this property is computational. To evaluate the effect in the
score that the addition (or removal) of an arc inG will have,
we need only to recompute the local score of the families
affected.
In conclusion, for the purposes of learning using either the
MDL or the Bayesian score, all the required information
about the training data D is summarized by a set of sufficient
statistics. These statistics are of the form Nx, ,pa(X,) for
choices of pa(X;) in the set of networks considered during
the search.

Sequential Update of Bayesian Networks

Sequential update of Bayesian networks is an on-line learn­
ing problem. At each iteration n, procedure receives a new
data instance un. and then produces the next hypothesis
Bn+l . This estimate is then used by to perform the re­
quired task (e.g., prediction, classification, diagnosis, etc.)
on the next instance Un+ 1, which in turn is used to update
the network and so on. In practice, the procedure might
generate a new model after some number of k instances are
collected (see Section 4); this however, does not change the
spirit of this discussion. An update procedure is evaluated
by the cumulative loss in each step. This loss might be de­
fined in several ways, usually depending on the particular
application. Thus, for example, in classification tasks, a
natural measure of this loss is the number of misclassified
instances. In density estimation tasks, the intent is to mea­
sure how well the procedure predicts the next instance, and
the log-loss, which is L n log PB" (un). is commonly used.
We start by formally describing the procedures for sequen­
tial update that define both ends of a spectrum in terms of
the tradeoff between storage requirements and quality of

167

the induced networks. We then introduce the incremental
approach in Section 3.2.
3.1

The Naive and MAP Approaches

The naive approach to sequential update consists of storing
all of the observed data, and then repeatedly invoking a
batch learning procedure on u1 ,
, Un to form the estimate
Bn. Clearly, a procedure based on this strategy uses all of
the observed information to construct the next estimate and
consequently should yield optimal results. However, as
noted in the introduction, this approach has unreasonable
space requirements in the long run. It needs to store either
all of the instances that have been observed, or keep a count
of the number of times each distinct instantiation to all the
variables in U was observed. The former representation
grows linearly with the number of instances collected, and
will become infeasible when the network is expected to
perform for long periods of time. A good example of such
a network, is the "alarm" network [ 1] which is part of a
system for monitoring of intensive care patients. In this
example, the domain consists of 37 variables that can have
253·95 distinct instantiations. Clearly, we cannot store counts
for each possible instantiation observed in the data.
• • •

An alternative approach is motivated by Bayesian learning
methodology. Recall that in Bayesian analysis we start with
a prior probability over possible hypotheses (models and
their quantifications), and compute the posterior given our
observations. In principle, we can then treat this posterior
as our prior for the next iteration in the sequential process.
Thus, we maintain our belief state about the possible hy­
potheses after observing u1,
, Un-I. Upon receiving Un,
we compute the posterior, produce the estimate Bn+ 1, and
store that posterior as our current belief state. This method­
ology has the attractive property that in the presence of
some reasonable assumptions, the belief state at time n is
the same as the posterior after seeing u1, . . . , Un from our
initial prior belief state. If we make the assumption that
the structure of the network is fixed and we use conjugate
priors, we can efficiently represent the posterior and update
it after each iteration using a closed-form formula [15].
• • •

This approach, however, is infeasible when we also attempt
to update the structure of the network. The BDe score is
based on assumptions that allow us to compactly represent
a prior using a single network and an equivalent sample
size [8]. Unfortunately, the posterior cannot be compactly
represented. The conjugate form for this prior essentially
requires storing a complete network, which is equivalent to
storing the counts for all possible assignments to U.
Since we cannot realize the exact Bayesian method, we
can resort to the following approximation. At each step, we
find (or approximate) the maximum a-posteriori probability
(MAP) network candidate. That is, the candidate that is
considered most probable given the data seen so far. We
then approximate the posterior in the next iteration by using
the MAP network as the prior network with the appropriate
equivalent sample size. In other words, this procedure uses
the network Bn as a summary of the first n observations.
This procedure is space efficient since we we only need to

last performed the update of the MAP. An approach similar

networks that are one change away (i.e., arc addition, dele­
candidate

Unfortunately, by using the MAP model as the prior for
the next iteration of learning, we are loosing information,
and are strongly biasing the learning process toward the
MAP model itself. To illustrate this phenomena, consider

a scenario where

U

consists of two variables

X andY.

In

this case, the learning procedure has to basically choose be­
tween two models:

Bt where X is independent of Y, and

B2 where X is dependent on Y. Now suppose that X and

Y are indeed correlated, but after observing the first, say,
50 instances, the posterior probability of the model where

X

is independent of Y is higher. This can happen when

the number of training instances is too small to determine

whether observed correlations between X and Y are gen­
uine correlations or artifacts of sampling noise. Since Bt
is the MAP model, we use it to represent our prior for the
next iteration of the learning procedure. Now suppose we
observe another 50 instances, and reconsider both models.
At this stage, however, our prior is strongly biased toward

The Incremental Learning Procedure

In this section, we propose an approach that explores the
middle ground between the two extremes discussed in the
previous section.

Unlike the naive approach, it does not

keep all possible data records (or an equivalent represen­
tation), and unlike the MAP approach, it does not rely on
a single network to represent the prior information. The
basic component of this procedure is a module that main­

In other words, the average encoding length per instance

For larger datasets, the redundancy in the the average en­

the amount of confidence in the learned parameters: As

2 are averages over the results of running the algorithms on
all 5 datasets.
For all three procedures described above we update the
parameters quantifying the current network candidate after
each instance is received. We set the prior probability to be
a weak uniform prior

(equivalent sample size of 5). We run
k IOO, 400 and 800. As

Naive with both the MDL and BDe scores. Similarly, we
run Incremental with both the modified scores introduced
in Section

3.3.

The evaluation of the quality of the induced networks is
based on the log-loss, that is Ln logPB" (un)· This is

a standard measure of performance in density estimation.
Since we generated the training sets from existing net­

works, we can measure how close the learned models are
to the generating distribution. In particular, we measured

normalized loss Ln(logr(un) -logPB,(un)) =
Ln log ;:·S!;]), where P* () is the probability of the gen­

the

erating distribution. This measure has several attractive
properties. First, it relates the loss incurred by the learn­
ing procedure to the optimal that can

instead of the true model. Second, the normalized loss is
related to the cross-entropy measure of distance between
probabilistic models. It is easy to see that cross entropy can

PB, (u)].
average is based on P*. Thus, the average normalized loss

We compared the performance of the three procedures we
described above. All three procedures take as a parameter
the number k of instances after which the network structure
is reconsidered. The procedures are:

Figure 1 summarizes the performance of each method in
terms of the average normalized loss. As expected, Naive
does better than all the others, since it is able to use all
the information observed in the data in a cumulative way.
The figures do not show significant difference between the
MDL and BDe scores for this procedure.

Figure 1: Performance results of several methods for sequential update. The left column reports results for "alarm" network

and the right column reports results for the "insurance" network. Results in the the top row use the MAP procedure with

the BDe score, the middle row use the incremental procedure using the BDe score, and the lower row use the incremental
procedure with the MDL. All the graphs also display the results of the naive method with the corresponding score as a

point of reference. The horizontal axis measures the number of instances seen. The vertical axis measures the average
normalized loss, where each data point is the average of a window of 250 instances over 5 datasets.

dency to lock on its current model once the prior received
sufficient weight. This can be seen very clearly from the
results of Figure 1 . The qualitative behavior of MAP ap­
proach shows i mprovement, until a stage where the equiva­
lent sample size of the prior is larger than about 5 * k, then
the procedure locks on a particular structure and the perfor­
mance levels off. In the case of k
I 00, the performance
actually degraded after this stage. (Unfortunately the per­
formance of this case falls off the range of the graphs.)
Of course, we might deal with this problem by setting the
prior strength to be smaller than the number of examples
seen. This, however, runs the risk of learning too simple
networks. (Recall that we adopt complex networks only if
the d ata supports it in a sufficiently large number of sam­
ples.) We are currently in the process of experimenting with
different strategies of setting the prior's equivalent sample
size.
=

As described in Section 3.2, we expect Incremental to
converge to the right distribution, albeit more slowly than
N a ive. This is i ndeed the qualitative behavior we can see in
Figure 1 . These curves show that the scores are consistent
and that the incremental procedure is sound, in the sense that
as more data is observed, the procedure outputs networks
that are closer in performance to the golden model and the
best possible sequential learning exhibit by the naive pro­
cedure. Also as expected, runs with larger k needed more
time to achieve a good level of performance. This is due
to the fact that the procedure posts new sufficient statistics
records only every k instances, and thus, it needs several k
instances before it can start maintaining sufficiently com­
plex statistics. However, in the long run, the procedures
with larger value of k seem more robust.
Figure 2 summarizes the space usage for these procedures.
The estimates are optimistic in that we count only the nec­
essary data structures and not any auxiliary ones. For Na ive
and MAP, we measure the space needed to store the dif­
ferent instances. For Incremental, we measure the space
needed to store all of the active sufficient statistics records.
Again as expected, Naive requires more and more mem­
ory since it needs to store all the previously seen instances.
On the other hand, MAP requires a constant amount of
memory, since it stores at most k instances at any time.
Finally, Incremental allocated more memory as it learned
a more complex structure. However, once the structure es­
timate stabilized, the memory usage of this procedure also
stabilized and remained roughly constant.
We remark that the memory usage in Incremental can be
minimized further when we have prior knowledge that limits
the space of possible networks (e.g., ordering constraints).
Additionally, we can use heuristic estimates to estimate
which arc additions are the most promising (using, for ex­
ample, pairwise mutual information), and only maintain the
corresponding records. We suspect that such a scheme can
reduce the space requirements by a large factor at a small
penalty in performance. We are currently in the process of
experimenting with these extensions.

Missing Data

In the above discussion, we have made the assumption that
the data is complete in the sense that each data instance
Un contains values for each variable in U. Unfortunately,

in many real life applications we are forced to deal with
incomplete data. The source of these incompleteness may
come from noisy measurements, or from domains in which
some attributes are not directly observed.
One source of difficulty in learning from incomplete data is
computational in nature. We can no longer decompose the
probability of the data. This means that the score (either
MDL or Bayesian) cannot be written as the sum of local
terms measuring how well we model the probability of each
variable given its parents as in Equation 1 . Moreover, in
order to evaluate the optimal choice of parameters for a
given candidate network structure, we must perform a non­
linear optimization using either Expectation Maximization
EM [ 1 1 ) or gradient descent [ 1 3) . In this paper we focus
on the EM procedure. The standard use of EM is for batch
learning. In addition, it is restricted to induce the parame­
ters under the assumption of a fixed structure. In order to
adapt EM to the sequential update problem we need to re­
lax both these restrictions. Fortunately, two recent methods
deal with each of these restrictions in turn, and as we now
describe, a combination of both methods leads to an elegant
learning procedure for sequential update.
For reasons of space, we keep the discussion at a high
level, and refer the interested reader to the relevant papers
cited below. The standard EM procedure for learning pa­
rameters iteratively and monotonically improves its current
choice of parameters for a fixed structure G using the fol­
lowing two steps. In the first step, the current parameters
e are used for computing the expected value of all the rele­
vant sufficient statistics records, Sujj( G). This computation
evaluates E[N(x) I D , Pa]
L-c ND+ (x)PB (D+ I D),
where B
(G, 6 ) and w e sum over all the possible com­
pletions n+ of D (that is, assignments to all unobserved
values in D). In the second step, e is replaced by the pa­
rameters 01 estimated from those expected statistics. This
second step is essentially equivalent to learning parameters
from complete data. The theoretical justification for this
procedure shows that by proceeding in this manner with
each iteration we i ncrease the probability that the observed
data was sampled from the distribution represented by the
structure and the induced parameters.
=

=

As described the procedure is a batch learning method in
that we must retain all of the training set. Neal and Hin­
ton [12) essentially show that we also i mprove this prob­
ability if we use an i ncremental update of the sufficient
statistics. In their approach, new incoming data cases are
used to continuously recompute the sufficient statistics. The
intuitive j ustification behind this approach is that any two
sufficiently long sequence of of i .i.d. samples are similar.
Thus, instead of storing the training data, this procedure
relays on new data. The second enhancement they describe
justifies updates to the parameters after every instance is
seen. This results in the following procedure for learning
parameters:

Using this decay parameter we gradually decrease the con­
tribution of old samples (which where "completed" by old
parameters).

This procedure is not guaranteed to make

positive progress in each step, however, on the average, it
does make progress and for a sufficiently long sequence,
the procedure will converge.

Jar results apply to the Bayesian score as well. It follows
then that we can use the expected sufficient statistics in our
search procedure to evaluate new models.

There is no intrinsic difficulty in casting the results of [4]
in the incremental framework of [ 1 2]. Combining the two

techniques we get a simple modification of our approach
that deals with incomplete data:

The second restriction of the standard EM is that it deals
only with learning parameters in a fixed structure. Fried­
man [4] shows that if use the expected sufficient statistics
to evalu ate alternative structure s using the MDL score and
choose structures that are assigned a higher score than the
current model, then we are bound to improve the marginal
score of network with respect to the observed data. Simi-

It is well known that EM methods may reach a sub-optimal

local minima. Standard techniques to avoid these minima
such as, for example, running EM several times with differ­
ent random starting points apply here as well. Of course;
we can run parallel executions of this procedure. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of
this procedure.

Discussion

Previous work on the sequential update of Bayesian net­
works have been mostly restricted to updating the param­
eters assuming a fixed structure [ 1 5] . The two notable
exceptions are the approaches by Buntine [21 and by Lam
and Bacchus [ 1 0] . Buntine's method assumes that a total
order on the variables is given, and it maintains sufficient
statistics for the possible parents of each node using lattice
structures. He imposes restrictions on the size of the lattices
in order to bound the amount of information that is main­
tained. Unfortunately, Buntine does not provide any reports
on experimental evaluations of his approach which makes
a rigorous comparison difficult. Lam and Bacchus propose
a different approach based on a modification of the MDL
score. In essence, they use the current network in each iter­
ation as a summary of previously seen data. This is similar,
in spirit, to the MAP approach described in Section 3 . 1 .
They performed experiments with the alarm network, yet
their evaluation criteria is not objective in the sense of a
log-loss scoring of the resulting networks, and once more,
rigorous comparisons are difficult.
The incremental approach introduced in this paper opens
new degrees of flexibility in various dimensions. First, by
using different search strategies, different search frontiers
are achieved, which in turn changes the amount of infor­
mation maintained. Additionally, we are actively consider­
ing different heuristics for pruning the number of sufficient
statistics stored in memory. These heuristics would rule out
statistics that are unlikely to lead to an arc addition.
As mentioned in the introduction, the approach we describe
is useful in applications that involve large amounts of data.
Such applications include data mining problems and mon­
itoring problems. We also note that by keeping a set of
likely candidates readily available, this approach can also
be useful to cases where there are real-time constraints on
the model selection process, and decisions have to be made
in a real-time fashion.
There are two topics that we are currently exploring. The
first is an empirical evaluation of these three methods in
situations where the underlying distribution drifts in time.
Our goal is to characterize the different parameters that
affect the efficiency of the procedure in "tracking" these
changes. The second topic involves learning in the presence
of incomplete data. We established the foundations of a
solution with the procedure described in Section 5. We are
in the process of conducting experiments that will allow us
to evaluate the approach and propose further refinements if
needed.
Finally, even though our results confirm the consistency
and effectiveness of the scores introduced in Section 3.3,

we would like a principled derivation based on a strictly
probabilistic interpretation. As mentioned in that section,
we pose this as an open problem.
