from the topology of two given dags whether they
are equivalent, i.e., whether they specify the same

other [Pearl et al., 1989]1.

Introduction

Directed acyclic graphs ( dags) have been widely used
for modeling statistical data. Starting with the pio­
neering work of Sewal Wright [Wright, 1921] who in­
troduced path analysis to statistics, through the more
recent development of Bayesian networks and influence
diagrams, dag structures have served primarily for en­
coding causal influences between variables as well
between actions and variables.

as

Even statisticians who usually treat causality with ex­
treme caution, have found the structure of dags to
be an advantageous model for explanatory purposes.
N. Wermuth, for example, mentions several such ad­
vantages [Wermuth, 1991]. F irst, the dag describes a
stepwise stochastic process by which the data could
have been generated and in this sense it may even
"prove the basis for d�veloping causal explanations"
[Cox, 1992]. Second, e ach parameter in the dag has
a well understood meaning since it is a conditional
probability, i.e., it measures the probability of the re­
sponse variable given a particular configuration of the

This paper adds a fifth advantage to the list above.
It presents an algorithm which decides for an ar­
bitrary list of conditional independence statements
whether it defines a dag and, if it does, a correspond­
ing dag is drawn. The algorithm we present has its
basis in the "Inferred-Causation" (IC) algorithm de­
scribed in [Pearl and Verma, 1991] and in Lemmas
1 and 2 of [Verma and Pearl, 1990].
Whereas in
[Pearl and Verma, 1991] we were interested in detect­
ing local relationships that we called "genuine causal
influences", we now consider an entire dag as one unit
which ought to fit the data at hand.

Problem

Given a list M of conditional independence statements
ranging over a set of variables U it is required to decide
whether there exists a directed acyclic graph (dag) D
that is consistent with M.

Our analysis will focus on lists that are closed un­
der the graphoid axioms (see Appendix for definition).
Section 5 will discuss possible extensions to lists which
are not closed.
1The criterion for dag equivalence is given in Corol­
3.2.
It follows from Frydenberg's analysis of
chain graphs, which applies to strictly positive distribu­
tions.
The more direct analysis of Verma and Pearl
[Verma. and Pearl, 1990] renders the criterion applicable to
arbitrary distributions, as well as to non-probabilistic de­
pendencies of the graphoid type [Pearl a.nd Paz, 1986).

Definitions

A dependency model is a list of conditional indepen­
dence statements of the form I(A, BjC), where A, B
and C are disjoint subsets of some set of variables U.
A dag D is consistent with a dependency model M
if every statement in M and no statement outside M
follows from the topology of D. In this case, M is
said to be day-isomorphic. A statement I follows from
the topology of a dag D, if I holds in every proba­
bility distribution P that is compatible with D2 can
be decomposed into a product of conditional probabil ­
ities P(aj7r(a)), over all nodes a E U, where 1i'(a) is a
set containing the parents of a in D. Finally, a state­
ment I( A, BjC) holds in a probability distribution P
iff P(AjC)P(BjC) = P(ABjC).
The following definitions and notation are needed to
understand the proposed solution. A partially directed
acyclic graph (pdag) is a graph which contains both
directed and undirected edges, but it does not contain
any directed cycles. An extension of a pdag G, is any
fully directed acyclic graph, D, which has the same
skeleton (underlying undirected edges) as G and the
same vee structures as G. Three nodes form a vee

with the directionality of the D and let Ua stand

Correctness

The if part guarantees that every dag D which has the
same skeleton and vee structures as D*, is consistent
with M. The first step of Phase 1 attempts to con­
struct this invariant skeleton if M is dag-isomorphic.
The arrowheads added in the second step identify the
invariant vee structures, again, ifM is dag-isomorphic.

Note however, that Step 2 of Phase 1 directs arcs im­
mediately upon finding one set S satisfying condition
2 of the lemma. This decision is correct due to the
following lemma:

If M is not dag-isomorphic it would be possible for

Phase 1 to build a graph that is not a pdag if it weren't
for the failure condition in Step 2. The next example
illustrates a failure resulting from an application of
Phase 1 on a non-dag-isomorphic dependency model.

sure of the set {I(a, c[0), I(a, dl0), I(b, dl0)} under

This phase examines M and generates a graph,
G subject to the above guarantees, if possible.
That is, if M is dag-isomorphic then every ex­
tension of G is consistent with M.
The cor­
rectness of Step 1 of this phase follows from
Lemma 3.1 [Verma, 1991][Verma and Pearl, 1990] (a
detailed proof of which is given in the ap­
pendix). This lemma is also the basis for the in­
ference algorithm developed by Spirtes and Glymour
[Spirtes and Glymour, 1991].
Lemma 3.1 Let M be any dag isomorphic depen­

dency model, a dag D is consistent with M iff the
following two conditions hold:
1.

2.

Corollary 3.2 Two dags are equivalent iff they share
the same set of links and same set of vee structures.

One of the two directions would be assigned first,
then upon attempting the second the algorithm would
FAIL.
Phase 2

The task of Ph ase 2 is to find a whether a pdag, G,
has any extensions and to find ()ne if such exists. This
is a purely graph theoretic task; it does not involve M.
To prove that this phase of the construction is correct,
it is sufficient to prove that each of the four rules is
sound, namely, that the orientation choices dictated
by these r u les never need to be revoked.

The only-if portion of this lemma guarantees that:
1. If there exists some dag n• which is consistent
with M, then any dag D consistent with M must
have the same skeleton as n·.
2. Furthermore, every dag D, consistent with M
must have the same vee structures as D*.

as the number of variables grows. Thus it might be im­
practical to specify M by explicit enumeration of i ts !­
statements . In such cases it may be desirable , instead,
to specify a basis, L, such that M is th e logical closure
of L, (i.e. M = CL(L)), rel ati ve to some semantics,
(e.g. the graphoid axioms, correla ti onal graphoids ax­
ioms, or even probability the or y ).
The major difficulty in permitting the dependency
model to be specified as the closure of some basis lies
in solving the so called membership problem. Simply
stated, the problem is to decide if a particular state­
ment, 10, is contained in the closure , .M, of a given
list of statements, L. In general, membership prob­
lems are often undecidable, and of those that are de­
cidable, many are NP-hard. In particular, the mem­
bership problems for both graphoids and probabilistic
independence are unsolved [Geiger, 1990) .
However, in spite of this difficulty, it may still be pos­
sible to have an effic ient dag construction algorithm,
because the queries required are of a special form. The
algorithm makes four types of queries t o M:
1. "Is there any S

Another possible source for simplification is to note
D being tested in Step 2 of Phase 3 is not
dag, but the output of the construction
algorithm. While Example 3.7 demonstrates that it is
possible for D to contain !-statements which are not
in C L(L), it may still be the case that any such !­
statements must have either a certain form or some
other property that would simplify the membership
query.

Appendix: Proof of Lemmas
Definition A.1 (d-separation) For any dag D, two
disjoint sets of nodes, X, Y are d-separated given
a third Z, written ID(X, YIZ), if and only if no path
between any node in X and any node in Y is activated
by the set Z.

A path is active given a set Z if and only if every
head to head node of the path is active given Z and
every other node of the path is not in Z.
A node is active given a set Z if and only if there is
a directed path from it to some element of Z.

In the case that M is assumed to be the graphoid clo­
sure of L, queries of type 1, 2 an d 3 are all manageable.
The queries for Phase 1 can b o th be quickly answered
due to the following lemma5:

The three equivalent terms Z-active, "active given Z"
and "activated by Z" are used interchangeably.

i ) E M then then a and b are adjacent. It suf­
fices to considerS= {x #a, b: xis an ancestor of a or
b}. Since, by assumption, a and b are not d-separated
by any set, it must be the case that I(a, biS) r¢. M thus
there must be a path p connecting a and b in D which
is active given S. Since p is S-active, every head to
head node on p must be in or have a descendent in
S. But by the definition of S, every node wh i ch has
a descendant in S must be in S as well. Thus every
head-to-head node on p must be in S. Every other
node on p is an ancestor of a, b or one of the head to
head nodes of the path. Hence every node on p must
be in S with the exception of a and b. Thus every
node of p, except a and b, must be a head-to-head
node. There are only three paths satisfying this con­
dition: a -+ b, a +- b and a ...... c +- b. However the
last case is not possible because c is in S so it must
be an ancestor of either a or b and thus it cannot be
common child of both a and b as well or there would
be a directed cycle. Hence a and b are adjacent.
Part 2 If D is consistent with M then Condition 2
holds.
If b is head-to-head in between a and c t hen the two
link path cannot be de-activated by any set containing
b. The rest of the only-if portion of condition 2 follows
trivially from the definition of a vee structure.
To complete the proof of Part 2, let abc be a chain
with ...,ac. Furthermore, assume that for any set S,
i ) E M implies b ¢. S. If b were not head­
I(a, hS
to-head on the path abc then any set S for which
I(a, ciS) E M would necessarily contain b in order to
deactivate this path. Since -,ac, there must be a such
an S, however by assumption for any such S, b r¢. S.
Thus b must be head-to-head on the p ath abc, hence
it must be the case that

;bc.

Part 3 If Conditions 1 and 2 hold then D is consistent
with M.
If M is dag isomorphic then there must exist a dag
which is consistent with M, call it D*. By Parts 1 and
2 above , D and D* have the same skeletons and vee
structures, so it is enough to prove Proposition A.2:
Proposition A.2 If any two dags, D and E, have the
same skeletons and vee structures then every active
path in one dag corresponds to an active path in the
other.
Let p be an S-active path in D which is minimal in
the following sense: if k is the number of nodes in p,

p1 is the first node and Pic is the last node then (1)
there cannot exist an S-active path b etween p1 and Pk

with strictly fewer than k nodes and (2) there cannot
exist a different S-active path fjJ between p1 and Pk
with exactly k nodes such that for all 1 < i < k, either
¢;= p; or ¢1 is a descendant of Pi.

Since D and E have the same links p must be a path
in E. It can be shown by induction on the number
of head-to-head nodes that p is S-active in E as well.
By definition, a single nodes will be considered as an
active path. The remainder of the proof has three
sub-parts: the first part proves that if p contains no
head-to-head nodes then it isS-active in E, the second
pa r t proves that if p contains at least one head-to-head
node x = Pi then p is S-active in E iff x is S-active in
E, and the third part proves that x is S-active in E.
Sub-Part 1:
If p does not contain any head-to-head nodes in

D

then it would be S-active in E unless it contains a
head-to-head node in E. It is enough to show that p
cannot have any head-to-head nodes in E. Suppose
that some node x = p; were head-to-head in E with
parents y = Pi-t and z = Pi+!, Figure 2 shows the
possible configurations for D.

D has no head-to-head nodes, but E does.

The parents of p; along p in E would be adjacent in
both D and E since the two graphs share links and
vee structures. But the sequence of nodes formed by
removing p; from p would be a path in D since its par­
ents would be adjacent. Moreover this path would be
5-active since it could contain no head-to-head nodes
(unless D cont ai ned a directed loop). But this path
would contradict Condition 1 of the minimality of p in
D. T herefore if p contains no head-to-head nodes in
D then it is S-active in E.
Sub-Part 2:

Suppose that p contains at least one head-to-head node
x = Pi in D with parents y = Pi-t and z = Pi+t as
shown in Figure 3. Let Pt,i-1 be the subpath of p be-

would be a single node. Both PI and P2 are minimal

head-to-head nodes than pthus by the inductive hy­
pothesis, they are 5-active in E. If y and z were adja­
cent in D then since both nodes are both 5-active in
D (they are parents of an 5-active node) and neith er
is in 5 (because neither is head-to-head on pin D),
it follows that the path formed by removing x from p
would be 5-active. This path which would contradict
Condition 1 of the minimality of p.
Therefore y and z cannot be adjacent in either gr aph
and must be common parents of x in both. Since x is
head-to-head on pin E and both the subpaths Pt,i-1
and Pi+I,!: are 5-active in E it follows that p would be
5-active in E iff x were 5-active in E.
Sub-Part 3:
Since x is 5-active in D there exists a directed path in
D from x to some node w in S. Let ,P be the shortest
such path. It remains to show (by induction on the
length l of¢) that ¢ is strictly directed from x to w in
E. There are three cases, either l:::: 0, I= 1 or l > 1.
If I= 0 then

x

w

and

x

is trivially S-active in E.

If 1 = 1 then ,P is a single link. Consider the parents,
y and z of x. If they were both adjacent to w as in

Lemma

Proof: Suppose abc and 3s s.t. I( a, cfS)

E M and
b tJ. S. In order for S to d-separate a and c, it must be
the case that a---> b <--- c- if b were not head-to-head
then this two link path would be active given any set
not containing b. Now since b is head-to-head it must
be the case that any set S which contains b will activate
this two link path, hence for any 5 if I( a, biS) E M

then b r¢. S.

single link descendant path.

Figure 4 then they would be common parents of w in
D (or there would be a directed loop in D). Thus
the sequence of nodes p' formed by replacing x with
w in p would be an S-active path in D.
This path
would contradict Condition 2 of the minimality of p,
so at least one parent of x must not be adjacent to w.
Without loss of generality, assume y is not adjacent
to w. Since y and w are not parents of x in D, they
cannot both be parents of x in E as the two graphs
share vee structures. Therefore x must be a parent of
w in E and x would be S-active in E.
If 1 > 1 then¢ contains at least two links. Consider the
last two links of¢, shown in Figure 5 whe r e u = ¢1-2,
v = </>r- 1. Note that l- 2 may equall in which case
x = u.
The initial subpath ¢1,1-t must be directed
from x to v by induction. If u were adjacent to w then
there would have been a shorter directed path from
x to w in D, thus u and w are not adjacent and not
parents of v in D so they cannot both be parents of v
in E. Therefore v must be a parent of w in E and ¢
D
is S-active in E.
Corollary 3.2 Two dags are equivalent iff they share
the same set of links and same set of vee structures.
Proof: This result follows directly from the proof of
D
the previous lemma.

Lemma 5.1

Proof: This can be proven by induction on the deriva­
tion of I( a, biS). If th e derivation has length 0 then
the lemma is trivial. If it is of length k then I( a, bf5)

must follow from one of the rules. Each rule has an an­
tecedent with a separated from bin a manner satisfying
the inductive hypothesis. Thus since this antecedent
must have a derivation of length < k the lemma holds.
