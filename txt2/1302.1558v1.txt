Luby, 1993] inference.
The critical factor in exact inference schemes is the
topology of the underlying graph and, more specifi­
cally, its connectivity. The complexity of approximate
schemes may, in addition, depend on factors like the
a-priori likelihood of the observed evidenee or asymme­
tries in probability distributions. There are a number
of ingeniously efficient algorithms that allow for fast
belief updating in moderately sized models.2 Still,
eaeh of them is subject to the growth in complexity
that is generally exponential in the size of the model.
Given the promise of the decision-theoretic approach
and an increasing number of its practical applications,
it is important to develop schemes that will reduce the
computational complexity of inference. Even though
the worst case will remain NP-hard, many practical
eases may become tractable by, for example, exploring
the properties of practical models, approximating the
inference, focusing on smaller elements of the models,
reducing the connectivity of the underlying graph, or
by improvements in the inference algorithms that re­
duce the constant factor in the otherwise exponential
complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a computational frame­
work for reasoning in Bayesian belief networks that
derives significant advantages from focused inference
and relevance reasoning. We introduce a technique
called relevance-based decomposition, that computes
the marginal distributions over variables of interest
by decomposing a network into partially overlapping
sub-networks and performing the computation in the
identified sub-networks.
As this procedure is able,
for most reasonably sparse topologies, to identify sub­
networks that are significantly smaller than the en­
tire model, it also can be used to make computa­
tion in large networks doable, under practical limi­
tations of the available hardware.
In addition, we
demonstrate empirically that it can lead to signifi­
cant speedups in large practical models for the dus2 For an overview of various exact and approximate ap­

The cornerstone of most relevance-based methods

is probabilistic independence, captured in graphical
models by a condition known as d-separation lPearl,

dence node blocks the propagation of information from

The next step in reducing the graph is removal of
barren nodes [Shachter, 1986]. Nodes are barren if
they are neither evidence nodes nor target nodes and
they have no descendants or if all their descendants

are barren. Barren nodes may depend on the evi­
dence, but they do not contribute to the change in
probability of the target nodes and are, therefore,

Schemes based on d-separation can be f urther en­

344

Lin and Druzdzel

such independences are listed by Druzdzel and Suer­
mondt [1994]. Other relevant work is by Boutilier et
al. [1996], Heckerman [1990), Heckerman and Breese
[1994], Smith et al. [199:3], and Poole [ 1 99:3].
The above example illustrates that relevance reasoning
can yield sub-networks that are much smaller and less
densely connected than the original network. The net­
work in Figure 1-b, in particular, is singly connected
and can be solved in polynomial time. This can lead to
dramatic improvements in performance, as most rele­
vance algorithms operate on the structural properties
of graphs and their complexity is polynomial in the
number of arcs in the network (see Druzdzel and Suer­
mondt [1994] for a brief review of relevance-based al­
gorithms).
There are two additional simple methods that we im­
plemented in our framework. The first method, termed
evidence propagation, consists of instantiating nodes
in the network if their values are indirectly implied by
the evidence. The observed evidence may be causally
sufficient to imply the values of other, as yet unob­
served nodes (e.g., if a patient is male, it implies that
he is not pregnant). Similarly, observed evidence may
imply other nodes that are causally necessary for that
evidence to occur (e.g., observing that a car starts im­
plies that the battery is not empty). Each instanti­
ation reduces the number of uncertain variables and,
hence, reduces the computational complexity of infer­
ence. Further, instantiations can lead to additional
reductions, as they may screen off other variables by
making them independent of the variables of interest.
The second method involves absorbing instantiated
nodes into the probability distributions of their chil­
dren. Once we know the state of an observed node,
the probabilities of all other states becomes zero and
there is no need to store distributions which depend
upon those states in its successors. We can modify the
probability distribution of its successors and remove
the arcs between them. The practical significance of
this operation is that the conditional probability ta­
bles bec.ome smaller and this reduces both the memory
and computational requirements. Evidence absorption
is closely related to the operation by that name in
the Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter's [1988] clustering al­
�orithm and has been stud.ied in detail by Shachter
l1990].
We should remark here that in cases where all nodes
belong to the target set T, most of the techniques re­
viewed in this section cannot reduce the size of any
cliques in the network - since everything is relevant,
nothing can be removed. Evidence absorption, how­
ever, removes all outgoing arcs of the evidence nodes
and, thereby, reduces the size of some cliques and guar­
antees to produce less complex networks, unless all ev­
idence nodes are leaf nodes. Of course, the clustering
algorithms can be improved to reduce the clique size
in practice, but this reduction usually amounts to re­
duction in computation and not in memory size taken

by a clique, as it is done after the network has been
compiled into a clique tree. The evidence absorption
scheme achieves such reduction before eonstruc.ting the
junction tree. Lastly, we want to point out that evi­
dence absorption often results in more removal of nui­
sance nodes, whieh is the subject of the next section.

Nuisance Nodes

Druzdzel and Suermondt [1994] introduced a class of
nodes called nuisance nodes and emphasized that they
are also reducible by relevance reasoning.
Nuisance
.
nodes consist of those predecessor nodes that do not
take active part in propagation of belief from the evi­
dence to the target.
Before discussing removal of nuisance nodes, we will
define them formally- we believe that this might help
to avoid misunderstanding. Of the definitions below,
trail, head-to-head node, and active trail are based on
Geiger e.t al. [1990a].

nodes, the assumption was that only the evidential
trails from £. to T are relevant for explaining the im­
pact of£. on T. N uisanc.e node is defined with respect
to T, £., and all evidential trails between them.
7 (nuisance node) A nuisance node,
given evidence £. and target T, is a node that z.s com­
putationally related toT given£ but is not part of any
evidential trail from any node in £. to any node in T.

Relevance Reasoning

Nuisance nodes are computationally related because
they are ancestors of some nodes on a d-connecting
path (please, note that they cannot be d-separated or
barren, as they have to be computationally related).
We will introduce the concept of nuisance anch or de­
fined as follows:
Definition 8 (nuisance anchor) A nuisance an­
chor zs a node on an evidential trail that has at least
o ne immediate predece.s.sor that is a nuisance node.

We will aim to remove entire groups of connected nui­
sanc-e nodes, which will be captured by the following
two definitions:

is a subgraph consisting of an anchor and all its nui­
sance ancestors.

Since no barren nodes exist in a network that contains

The definition of nuisance nodes provides a straight­
forward criterion for identifying them in a graphical
model. Identification of nuisance graphs can be per­
formed by a variant of the Depth-First-Search algo­
rithm that has complexity O(e), where e is the number
of arcs in the network. The algorithm in Figure 2 for
identifying nuisance nodes in directed acyclic. graphs
is a revised version of the non-separable component
algorithm (Even, 1979]. Since all descendant nodes
of target or evidence in the (pruned) computational
relevant subnetwork can not be nuisance nodes, we
mark them A CTIVE first. Then following an arc from
an active node to its parent, we find a non-separable
component, which is a nuisance graph if it does not
contain any active nodes.
To marginalize a nuisance graph into its anchor we
need to know the joint probability distribution of those
nodes in the graph that are the anchor's parents. In
ease the graph is a tree, the parents are independent
and the tree can be reduced by a recursive marginaliza­
tion of its bold nuisance nodes until the entire nuisance
tree is reduced.
Suppose (Figure :3-a) that the evidence set is £ = { d}
and the target set is T = { e}. Nodes a and b form a
nuisance tree with anchor at c and node f forms a one­
node nuisance tree with anchor in c. Nuisance nodes a

Marginalization of nuisance graphs that are not nui­
sance trees is less straightforward: to be able to remove
a nuisance graph, we need to first construct a new

Relevance-Based Decomposition

It is quite obvious that relevance rea.soning can lead
to signific.ant computational savi ngs if the reasoning
is focused, i.e., if the user is interested only in a sub­
set of nodes in the network. (We report almost three
orders of magnitude improvement in a very large rned�
ical diagnostic network in Section 5 .) Relevance-based
methods can be very useful even if no target nodes
are specified, i.e., when all nodes in a network are of
interest. When the original network is large, comput­
ing the posterior distribution over all nodes may be­
come intractable: for example, due to excessive mem­

cases, we can attempt to divide the network into sev­
eral partially overlapping subnetworks, where all sets
combined cover the entire network, Focusing on eac:h
of these small subnetworks in separation leads eventu­
ally to updating the beliefs of all nodes in the network.
The main problem is, of course, dividing the network.

conditional probability table for the nuisance anchor.
Temporarily forgetting about the evidence present in
the network, we condition on the non-nuisance par­
ents of the nuisance anchor and treat the nuisance an­
chor as a target node. The rest of the network below
the nuisance anchor is computationally irrelevant to
the target. Any standard inference algorithm can be
used to compute the conditional probability distribu­
tion of the nuisance anchor, which can then be used
to merge the entire nuisance graph into the anchor.
When all parents of the nuisance anchor themselves
are nuisance nodes, we can remove the entire nuisance
graph by computing the prior probability distribution
of the nuisance anchor. While computing the prob­
ability distribution over a nuisance anchor is hard in
general, this probability distribution can be precom­
puted in advance for some of the those subnetworks
that are potential nuisance graphs. Please, note that
the probability distribution over a potential noise an­
chors is not conditioned on any evidence, which makes
such precomputation feasible.
Removal of a nuisance tree originating from a nuisance
anchor reduces one dimension of the conditional prob­
ability table (and hence, clique) containing the nui­
sance anchor and its remaining parents. In the case
of nuisance graphs that are not trees, while their re­
moval may lead to significant computational advan­
tages, the computation related to establishing their
marginal probability may be in itself complex. To
make the marginalization of nuisance graphs worth­
while, it is possible to cache conditional probability
tables for those cases that are commonly encountered.
These cache tables can be computed at the time the
model is constructed and stored for the efficiency of
later reasoning. Please note that tables only at those

We accomplish that by choosing at each step i a small
set of target variables T; and pruning those nodes in
the network that are not computationally relevant to

updating the probability of T; given [.
Since not
all nodes in the network are computationally relevant
to T;, the size of relevant subnetworks can be much
smaller than that of the original network. The order
in which the target sets T; are selected is crucial for
the performance of the algorithm. Obviously, with a
wrong choice ofT;, the subsets may overlap too much
and lead to performance deterioration. lJ seful heuris­
tics that will minimize the overlap among various sub­
networks remain still to be studied. We have observed,
however, that even with a very crude choice of the tar­
get sets T;, not only can we handle many intractable
networks, but also decrease the total computation time
in tractable networks. ( We report four-fold increase in
speed in Section 5.) This, of course, is not guaran­
teed and depends on the topology of the network. In
very densely connected networks, everything may be
relevant to everything, no matter what target set we

choose. Such

networks, however, would be

intractable

for any exac.t inference algorithm.
A sketch of the algorithm outlined informally above is
given in Figure 4. We choose at each step i a set of tar­
get nodes T;. Subsequently, we use the relevance rea­
soning techniques outlined in Sections 2 and :3 to iden­

subset of .'h, which leads to redundant computation.
We could avoid this by choosing h as a target before

Empirical Results

In this section, we present the results of an empm­
cal test of our relevance-based framework for Bayesian
belief network inference. We focused our tests on the
most surprising result: impact of relevance-based net­
work decomposition on the computational complexity
of the inference. The algorithm that we used in all
tests is an efficient implementation of the clustering
algorithm that was made available to us by Alex Ko­
zlov. See Kozlov and Singh [1996] for details of the
implementation and some benchmarks. We have en­
hanced Kozlov's implementation with relevance tech­
niques described in this paper. We have not included
caching the probability distributions of nuisance an­
chors in our tests.
We tested our algorithms using the CPCS network, a
multiply-connected multi-layer network consisting of
422 multi-valued nodes and covering a subset of the
domain of internal medicine [Pradhan et a/., 1994).
Among the 422 nodes, 14 nodes describe diseases, 3:3
nodes describe history and risk factors, and the re­
maining 375 nodes describe various findings related to
the diseases. The CPCS network is among the largest
real networks available to the research community at
present time.
Our computer (a Sun Ultra-2 workstation with two
168Mhz UltraSPARC-1 CPU's, each CPU has a
0.5MB L2 cache, the total system RAM memory of

:384 MB) was unable to load, compile, and store the
entire network in memory and we decided to use a sub­
set consisting of 360 nodes generated by Alex Kozlov
for earlier benchmarks of his algorithm. This network
is a subset of the full422 node CPCS network without
predisposing factors (like gender, age, smoking, etc..).
This reduction is realistic, as history nodes c.an usually
be instantiated and absorbed into the network follow­
ing an interview with a patient.
We generated 50 test cases consisting of ten ran­
domly generated evidence nodes from among the find­

cases, we (1) ran the clustering algorithm on the whole
network, (2) ran the relevance-based decomposition al­
gorithm without nuisance node removal, and (:)) ran
the relevance-based decomposition algorithm with nui­
sance node removal. In case of the relevance-based de­
composition, we selected at eaeh step one target node
from among those nodes that had not been updated.
We always took the last node on the node list, which
was ordered according to the partial order imposed by
the graph structure (i.e., parents prece ded their chil­
dren on the list). This procedure gave preference to
nodes dose to the bottom of the graph. The results of
our tests are presented in Figure 6 with the summary
data in Table 1. It is apparent that the relevance­
based decomposition in combination with the cl us­
tering algorithm performed on average over 20 times
faster than clustering algorithm applied to the entire
network. This difference and the observed variance
was sm all enough to reject possible differences due
to chance at p < 10-38. Nuisance node removal ac­
counted on the average for over :30% improvement in
speed (p < 10-4).

case. In no other of the 50 eases was the dustering al­
gorithm faster. We also run tests on several networks
that we took from a student model of the Andes intelli­
gent tutoring system [Conati et a/., 1997] with similar
results. Some of the Andes networks were too large
to be solved by the clustering algorithm, but were up­
dated successfully by the relevanc.e-based decomposi­
tion. Performance differences in ease of random tests
of tractable Andes networks were minimal and often
relevance-based decomposition performed worse than
the clustering algorithm applied to the whole network,

which confirms that the advantages of relevance-based
decomposition are topology-dependent. Focused in­
ference b ased on relevance reasoning was, on the other
hand, consistently orders of magnitude faster than be­
lief updating in the entire network.
One weakness of our experiments that we realized only
recently is that we d i d not h ave full control over the
triangulation algorithm used by the available imple­
mentation of the clustering algo rithm . We realized
that the· triangulation algorithm did little in terms of
optimizing the size of the junction tree and was sen­
sitive to the initial ordering of the nodes . Relevance
algorithm run i n the p reprocessing phase usually im­
pac ted this ordering. Still, we c.onsider it impossible
that the observed differences in performance can be
attributed to noise in triangulation algorithm - our
results are too consistent for this to be a eompetitive
rival hypothesis.

D iscussion

Computational com pl exity remains a major problem
in application of probability t he ory and decision the­
ory in k n owledge based systems. It is important to
develop schemes that will reduce it - even though
the worst case will remain NP-hard , many practical
cases may become tractable. In this paper , we pro ­
posed a computational framework for belief updating
in directed p robabilistic graphs based on relevance rea­
soning that aims at reducing the size and connectiv­
ity of networks in cases where the i nfer enc e is focused
on a su bset of the network 's n o des . We introd uced
relevance-based decomposition, a scheme for comput­
ing the marginal distributions of target variables by
decomposing the set of target variables into subsets,
determining which of the model variables are relevant
to those subsets given the new evidence, and perform­
ing the computation in the so-identified sub-networks.

As relevance-based decomposition can, for most
reasonably sparse topologies, identify sub-networks
that are significantly smaller than the entire model.
Relevance-based decomposition can also be used to
make c.omputation tractable in large networks. A
somewhat surprising empirical finding is that this pro­
cedure often leads to signi fi c an t performance improve­
ment even in tractable networks, compared to exact
inference in the entire network. One explanation of
this finding is that relevance-based techniques are of­
ten capable of reducing the c.lique size at a small com­
putational cost. Roughly speaking, the clustering al­
)!;orithm constructs a junction tree, whose nodes de­
note partially overlapping dusters of variables in the
original network. Each duster , or clique, encodes the
marginal distribution over the set val( X) of the nodes
;t' in the cluster. T he complexity of inference in the
j unction tree is determined roughly by the size of the
largest clique. Reducing the size of the junction tree
and breaking large cliques can reduce the complexity of
reasoning drastically. Another reason for the observed

speedup

that smaller networks are more wrnpatible
hardware r.ache o n most computer configura­
tions and lead to faster computation by avoiding cach e
p age thrashing. For every corn pu ter system , there
exist networks that do not fit in its cache or work­
ing memory. D e co mpos i ti on described in t h is paper

in such cases.

w i t h the

Clustering algorithms aim at distributing the compu­
tational com])lexity between the process of cornpiling
a graph, in which the pror.ess of triangularizing the
graph is the most important, and belief updating. This
is particularly advantageous when a domain model is
static in the sense of no t b ein g modified w hile entering
evidence and processing probabilistic queries. M eth­
ods, as out lined in this paper, seem to be not very
suitable for such situations: the framework for rele­
vance reaso n in g presented in this paper always starts
with the initial network and produces reduced net­
works that need to be c o mp il ed from snatch. The
cost for using this scheme and all relevance schemes
that work on directed graphs is the c.ost to recompile
relevant sub-networks into clique trees before compu­
tation. We have found that the relevance algorithms
prove themselves worth the cost by sufficient savings
in terms of reduced size and connect i vi ty of the ne t­
work. This can be further enhanced , as one of the
reviewers suggested, by caching results of reasoning in
overlapp ing subgraphs. Compilation of and reasoning
with the reduced networks may achieve results faster
than reasoning with the original network. Applica­
tion of the p r op os ed schemes suggests that efforts be
direc.ted at deve lo ping efficient triangularization algo­
rithms that can approach optimality fast and can be
used in real-time. Some hope for such schemes has
been given in the recent work of Becker and Ueiger
[1 996] .
We believe that the relevance-based preprocessing of
role in improving - the
tractability of probabilistic inference in practical sys­
tems. T heir computational complexity is low and they
can be used as an enhancement to any algorithm, even
one that draws significant advantages from p recompi­
lation of networks, such as the dustering algorithm
used in all test runs in this paper.
net works will play a signifi cant
