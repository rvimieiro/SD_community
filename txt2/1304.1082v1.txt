qualitative belief propagation, traces the
qualitative effect of evidence through a belief
network from one variable to the next. This
propagation algorithm is an alternative to the
graph reduction algorithms of Wellman (1988) for
inference in qualitative probabilistic networks. It is
based on a qualitative analysis of intercausal
reasoning, which is a generalization of Pearl's
"explaining away", and an alternative to Wellman's
definition of qualitative synergy. The other,
Scenario-based reasoning, involves the generation
of alternative causal "stories" accounting for the
evidence. Comparing a few of the most probable
scenarios provides an approximate way to explain
the results of probabilistic reasoning. Both
schemes employ causal as well as probabilistic
knowledge. Probabilities may be presented as
phrases and/or numbers. Users can control the
style, abstraction and completeness of
explanations.
1 Introduction

The developers of expert systems and decision
support systems have long been aware of the
importance of facilities to explain the computer­
based reasoning to users as a prerequisite to their
more widespread acceptance (e.g. Teach &
Shortliffe, 1981). Unless users can come to

Foundation under grant IRI-8807061 to Carnegie Mellon

understand the assumptions and reasoning of
such systems, it is impossible to develop the kind
of human-machine collaboration that is the basis
for successful use of such systems. For
explanations to be effective, their form and content
must be carefully matched to the users'
competence, knowledge, and styles of reasoning.
The approach that underlies the classic "expert
systems" paradigm is to employ computer
representations and inference mechanisms
intended to emulate human reasoning. To the
extent that this emulation is successful, the
computer-based reasoning ought to seem familiar
to people and so relatively easy to explain. While
there is ample evidence that normatively appealing
probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes are
poor models of human reasoning under
uncertainty (e.g. Kahneman et a/. 1982), there is
surprisingly little experimental evidence that the
rule-based alternatives, such as certainty factors
or fuzzy logic, are any better as descriptive
models. And even if successful descriptively, the
emulative approach would merely reproduce the
documented deficiencies of our intuitive reasoning
rather than complement and enhance it. Are we
forced to choose between the unreliable and the
inexplicable? Our approach to this dilemma is to
explore whether in fact it may be possible to
explicate probabilistic reasoning in ways better
attuned to human thinking.
Only recently has much attention begun to be paid
to the automatic generation of comprehensible
explanations for probabilistic and decision analytic
schemes. Horvitz et a/. (1986) present a system
which can explain its recommendations about
what test to perform to gather diagnostic evidence.
Langlotz et a/. (1986) present a scheme for
quantitative analysis of decision trees, which
explains qualitatively how one decision may
outweigh another in terms of expected utility.
Klein (1990) presents a scheme for qualitatively

explaining the implications of hierarchical additive
value functions. Elsaesser (1988) provides some
empirical evidence on the efficacy of explanations
of simple Bayesian inference, with one variable
and one observation. Strat's (1988) system
explains the dynamics of Dempster-Shafer
reasoning based on sensitivity analysis, with
interesting implications for probabilistic schemes.
Sember and Zukerman's (1989) scheme
generates micro explanations, that is local
propagation of evidence between neighbouring
variables in a belief net.
Our focus here is on approaches for generating
macro explanations, intended to explain
probabilistic reasoning over larger networks. We
wish to avoid dogmatism about what kinds of
explanation scheme will be most effective, but
rather explore a variety of approaches, including
graphical, numerical, and linguistic
representations. We are interested in both
quantitative and qualitative forms of explanation in
various combinations. This paper gives an
account of several of the key ideas that have
emerged from our initial work.
Since our goal is to produce interpretations of
probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible
with human reasoning styles, we started out with
an empirical study of human strategies for
uncertain reasoning. This provided us with the
inspiration for the design of two new and
contrasting modes of explaining probabilistic
reasoning, namely qualitative belief propagation
and scenario-based reasoning.
It is useful to distinguish explanation as the
communication of static knowledge or beliefs from
explanation of the dynamics, of how beliefs are
changed in the light of new evidence. Explanation
of the statics, though relatively straightforward, is a
prerequisite for explanation of the dynamics.
Among the issues in static explanation we discuss
are the use of belief nets, the use of linguistic
phrases to express probabilities, and the
importance of causal knowledge. Next we outline
the use of qualitative belief propagation as a
means of dynamic explanation. This includes an
analysis of qualitative intercausal reasoning,
generalizing Pearl's notion of "explaining away",
with a theorem giving a precise characterization of
when it applies. Finally, we describe a scenario­
based approach to explanation. This is illustrated
by explanations generated from our prototype
implementation in Allegro Common Lisp, QIQ
(Qualitative Interface to the Quantitative).

2 Human reasoning under uncertainty

The essence of effective explanation is to design
its content and form to mesh with the knowledge
and modes of thought of the person to whom you
are explaining. Thus, producing good
explanations of formal reasoning under uncertainty
requires an understanding of the way people
reason intuitively under uncertainty. There is a
vast literature on human judgment under
uncertainty for very simple inference problems,
typically with a single hypothesis variable and a
single observation (e.g. see Kahneman et al.,
1982 and Morgan & Henrion, 1990 for reviews),
but relatively little is known about cognitive
processes in more complex situations. To improve
our insights into this and to seek inspiration for
alternative approaches to explanation, we
conducted a series of cognitive process-tracing
studies. We recorded and analyzed verbal
protocols from subjects asked to think aloud as
they performed uncertain reasoning tasks
(Druzdzel, 1989). Here is a sample task:
Harry is in the house of a new acquaintance and
suddenly finds himself sneezing. This could be
due to an incipient cold, or to an allergy attack
brought on by a cat. Before he started sneezing
he would have judged the cold and allergy both
about equally unlikely.

(a) Given he is sneezing, roughly what is the
probability Harry is getting a cold?

I

(b) Suppose Harry now notices small paw-prints
on the furniture. How should this affect his
degree of belief that he is getting a cold?

I

(c) Suppose he then hears a barking of a small
dog in the room next-door. How does this
further affect his degree of belief that he is
getting a cold?

I

Most subjects were able to provide qualitative
answers to these questions rather easily. In (a)
they judged a cold was about as likely as not. In
(b) that the paw-prints should decrease his belief
in the cold, since the sneezing might be explained
by a cat, suggested by the paw-prints. And in (c),
that hearing the barking dog should increase belief
in the cold again, since the dog provides an
alternative explanation of the paw prints.
One unsurprising finding was that subjects
generally used qualitative terms for probabilities,
using quantitative terms almost not at all. This
finding is consistent with previous studies of
intuitive reasoning (e.g. Kuipers, Moskovitz &
Kassirer, 1988}. Another finding confirming
previous work (e.g. Kahneman and Tversky, 1980)

was the importance of causal reasoning in
uncertain inference.
Less expected and of considerable interest in the
current context, was evidence of two quite
different strategies for plausible reasoning. One,
which we call qualitative belief propagation,
involves propagating the qualitative impact of
evidence from event to event, following local
causal and diagnostic relationships. For example,
barking indicates the presence of the dog. The
dog explains the pawmarks, which are th�n

weaker evidence for the cat. Reduced belief 1n the
cat in turn reduces belief in the allergy. This is
noJ.. less of an explanation for the sneezing and so
requires an increased belief in the cold.
The other strategy, scenario-based reasoning, is
quite different, and was more common in the
protocols. The reasoner identifies one or more
scenarios, that is consistent instantiations of the
variables, forming a coherent, often causal,- story,
compatible with the known evidence. For
example, Harry has a cold, which explains the
sneezing; there is no cat, and so no allergy; the
dog explains the paw-prints and barking. Subjects
often appeared to develop one or more such
quasi-deterministic scenarios. Figure 1 shows two
such scenarios, as a subset of the event tree.

probabilistic information is the Bayesian belief net

about conditional dependence and Independence.
Figure 2 provides a belief network for probabilistic
knowledge for the "sneeze" example.
The nodes depict the key variables. (NB, we use
the abbreviated term "Cat" to mean "the presence
of a cat in the vicinity", and so on.) As usual, the
directed arcs depict dependences between them,
(or more strictly the absence of arcs depicts
independence). The same. information could, of
course, be represented in text as a list of the
dependencies, such as,

and so on.

sneeze problem

The probability of some target event (e.g. the cold)
can then be judged by the relative probability of
the scenario(s) that contain(s) it. If one considered
all possible scenarios, then this strategy is an
exact algorithm for Bayesian reasoning. This is
generally too much mental effort, but it can be a
good approximation if one considers only the few
most probable scenarios. On the other hand, if a
likely scenario is ignored or its relativ� probab �lity
misestimated, it can lead to severe b1ases. Th1s
scenario-based reasoning appears related to
explanation-based reasoning identified by a
number of psychologists as strategies for complex
reasoning tasks (e.g. Pennington & Hastie, 1988).
Both qualitative belief propagation and s�en�rio­
based reasoning can be seen as approx1mat1ons
of exact algorithms for probabilistic inference.

Figure 2: A belief network for the
"sneeze example"

The improved perspicuity of the graphical
representation in showing the locality of
relationships is immediately clear. Although for
some purposes the textual form is valuable,
particularly for those not familiar with the belief
network notation. To complete the static
explanation we need to add the probabilities in
some form.

13

3.2 Linguistic probabilities
One appealing approach to render numerical
probabilities more digestible is to translate them
Into verbal phrases, such as "very likely" or
"somewhat improbable". A considerable empirical
literature reports people's interpretations of verbal
probability phrases in terms of numerical
probabilities or ranges. In general this research
has found a degree of consistency in usage, at
least in the ordering people assign to sets of such
phrases (Budescu & Wallsten, 1985; Wallsten et
a/, 1986; Kong et a/. 1986). But it has also found
significant variability in interpretation between
people, and considerable context dependence
(Brun & Teigen, 1988). Nuclear safety engineers
mean something quite different by "uncommon"
than physicians. People interpret other people's
use of phrases somewhat differently (and with
wider range of uncertainty) from what they
themselves claim to mean by the phrases
(Wallsten et al; 1986); that is, they are sensitive to
the variability among people. This suggests
mappings from phrases to numbers, needed for
encoding, should be somewhat different, with
broader ranges than mappings from phrases to
numbers, as used here for explanations.

Probability

o-..-.-- impossible

Adverbs

even by event within a network. For example,
"unlikely" may mean something quite different
when applied to the chance of allergy to an
antibiotic than the chance of dying in an operation.
If desired, a different mapping may be used for
each event and influence. However we expect a
small number of mappings will be sufficient to
cover the contexts for a given network.
Relevant phrases can be divided into belief
phrases, such as "very probable" or "unlikely", and
frequency phrases, such as "common" or "rare".
Most come in both adjectival form, as above, and
adverbial form, such as "probably" or "commonly".
We have found it most natural to express marginal
prior and posterior probabilities of events in terms
of adjectival probabilities, for example,
Cold is very unlikely (p=0.08)
Cat is unlikely (p=O.l)
Dog is unlikely (p=O.l)

and to express conditional probabilities or causal
strengths (see below) in terms of adverbial
frequencies:

Cat commonly (p=0 8) causes allergy.
Dog as often as not (p=O.S) causes
barking.

structure in uncertain reasoning (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1980). People find it easier to reason
from cause to effect than vice versa. As we
mentioned, this was also apparent in our protocol
studies. Some, notably Pearl (1988), have
explicitly identified the directed arcs of belief nets
with cause-effect relations. Others have argued
that there is no inherent relationship with causality:
After all, the arcs can be reversed simply by
application of Bayes' rule, but causality cannot. But
in any case, it is usually most natural to assess
influences in causal direction. We view knowledge
of causal relations as an important semantic
enrichment to the pure belief net. It is not
essential for Bayesian inference, but can be of
great help in communicating with people, both for
encoding expert opinion and for explanation.
QIQ can encode a cause-effect relationship as
supplementary knowledge about each influence
arc. This information is used in generating text
descriptions of influences, for example:
Cat commonly (p=0. 8) causes allergy.
Cat is the only cause of allergy.

The quantities described here are causal
strengths, that is the probability that the specified
precursor event, if present, is sufficient to cause
the successor. If no other cause of the successor
is present then the causal strength is the same as
the conditional probability of the effect given the
cause. This is the case with the link from cat to
allergy, where no other cause is known (in this
example). However, if other causes are possible,
then the causal strengths may be different from
the conditional probabilities. Causal strengths are
an equivalent representation to the conditional
probability representation, and each can be
derived from the other.
The best known application of causal strengths is
in the noisy-OR gate, which often arises in
situations with multiple alternative causes of a
common effect. Each link from cause to effect is
characterized by its causal strength, the probability
of the effect given only that cause is present. The
condition it embodies is sometimes called causal
independence, namely that the probability that
each present cause is sufficient to produce the
effect is independent of the presence or sufficiency
of other causes. For example, we have,
Cold very commonly (p=0. 9) causes
sneezing.
Allergy very commonly (p=0. 9) causes
sneezing.

Causal independence can be expressed as:
Cold does not affect the tendency of
allergy to cause sneezing, and vice
versa.

In this case we also assume no leaks (Henrion,
1990), i.e. no "spontaneous" occurence of the

effect in the absence of explicitly modelled causes:
There is no other cause of sneezing
than cold and allergy

In other cases we cannot rule out leaks, for
example:
Cat as often as not (p=O.S)

causes

paw marks.
Dog as often as not (p=O. S)

causes

paw marks.
There are also other very unlikely
(p=O.l) causes of paw marks.

The latter assertion gives the leak probability, that
is the probability of paw marks given no cat or dog.
Note that the former two assertions do not give the
simple conditional probability of paw marks given
the cat (dog), but given also none of the "other
causes" mentioned in the last assertion.
The entire static description of the belief net used
in these examples is completed by the following
assertions:
Dog as often as not (p=O. S)
barking.

causes

Dog is the only cause of barking.

4 Qualitative belief propagation
The goal of qualitative belief propagation is to find
the direction of the impact of an observed variable
on the degree of belief in another variable,
whether increased, decreased, or unchanged (+0). Wellman (1988) presents a scheme for
qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs) which
provides an appealing formal basis for this task for
arbitrary belief nets. Wellman's scheme uses an
inference algorithm for QPNs using arc reversal
and graph reduction, modelled on Shachter's
algorithms for inference in quantitative belief
networks. However, human qualitative belief
propagation appears to trace the impact of
evidence locally from node to node, which seems
more reminiscent of the quantitative belief
propagation or message-passing algorithms
developed by Pearl and others than the reduction­
type algorithms.
Wellman (1988) provides a persuasive argument
for first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) as the
best formal interpretation of the informal notion of
the sign of an influence, whether knowledge of A
being true (high) increases or decreases belief in
B being true (high). Thus a positive influence of
binary variable A on variable B is defined thus:
I+(A, B)<=> P(b Ia y) 2: P( b I

a

y), 'Vy

[1]

15

(NB: We use the convention that uppercase letters
denote variables, and lowercase their values: a
means A is false.) Signs may be assigned to arcs
in the network either by direct assessment or, for
qualitative explanation of quantitative reasoning,
as an abstraction from quantitative assessments.
In the sneeze example, it is intuitively clear (and
consistent with the numbers used in the example)
that all influences are positive. For simplicity, we
will assume the network is singly connected and
limit ourselves to binary variables.

4.1 Three types of Inference
As a prerequisite to describing the algorithm for
qualitative belief propagation, we must first
distinguish the three types of inference: Predictive
(or causa� inference is in the same direction as
the original qualitative influence. Diagnostic
inference is in the reverse direction. lntercausal
inference gives the qualitative impact of evidence
for one variable A on another variable B, when
both have influences on a third variable C, about
which we have independent evidence. These
three situations are illustrated below in Figure 4.

•,.�-....

--....

Predictive
inference

Diagnostic
inference

But propagating across convergent arrows is less
straightforward: If there is no diagnostic evidence
for the common effect (or direct observation), e.g.
for C, then the two influencing variables A and B
are of course independent, and so knowledge
about A has no effect on B. On the other hand, if
we observe C (or have diagnostic evidence for it)
A and B become dependent. Thus, intercausal
inference is not a simple concatenation of
predictive and diagnostic inference. While there
has been much informal discussion of "explaining
away" (a form of intercausal reasoning) (Henrion,
1986; Pearl, 1988), a precise characterization
seems to be lacking of the general conditions
under which explaining away or other qualitative
intercausal reasoning applies. So we now turn to
this issue.

4.2 Qualitative lntercausal Influence
"Explaining away" applies when A and B are two
alternative causes of C, for example if the
influence of A and B on C is a noisy OR. Given
evidence for C, then evidence for A generally
produces a reduced belief in B. But what if the
influence is not a noisy-OR? What precisely are
the conditions on the influence of A and B on C
under which this qualitative pattern applies? Figure
5 presents the question schematically.

..

lntercausal
inference

16(E, A) & 16(A, B) => ll>*l>(E, B)
Diagnostic inference is similar to predictive
inference, although a little more complicated since
variable A inherits any relevant predecessors of B
in inverting the direction of the arrow. If we want to
propagate the effect of evidence across two
divergent arrows, we can simply chain the
diagnostic and predictive inference. Observation of
pawmarks increase belief in the cat, which in turn
increases belief in the allergy.

Figure 4: Three types of Inference.

Qualitative predictive inference is quite simple. If
we have positive evidence E that increases our
belief in A, and the influence of A on B is positive,
then E should also increase our belief in B
(actually, not decrease it, given Wellman's weak
definition of the direction of influence). More
generally, concatenation (chaining) produces an
influence whose sign is the product of the signs of
its component influences.

This result is easily derived from [2] by the
application of Bayes' rule. Condition [3] is
reminiscent of Wellman's (1988) definition of
qualitative synergy, but instead of the multiplicative
form he employs the additive form (for binary
variables),
P(c Ia b x)+P(c Ia 6 x) 2: P(c Ia 6 x) + P(c Ia b x),
'Vx [4]
It can be shown that if either or both of the
influences from A to C and from B to C are
positive, then multiplicative synergy [3] implies
ad�itive synergy [4]. It is also easy to show that
no1sy-OR gates are subsynergistic for product
synergy, just as Wellman showed they are
subsynergistic for additive synergy. Hence, if
P(CjA,B) is a noisy O R gate and C is observed
present, there is a negative influence between A
and B. So any further evidence for B will decrease
belief in A, and vice versa, since they provide
alter�ative explan�t.ions for C. In other words [3] is
prec1sely the cond1t1on under which explaining
away applies.
Note that if the influence has positive multiplicative
synergy, A has a positive influence on B, the
�nverse of. explaining away. For example, if the
Influence 1s a "leaky noisy AND gate", in which C
has an increased chance of occurring if A and B
both occur, then given C, knowledge of A may
increase belief in B. For example, suppose that
the presence of flammable material and an ignition
source together can cause combustion, which in
turn may cause smoke (which also has other
possible causes). Observation of smoke can
create a positive influence from flammable
material to the ignition source.

in the cold, given we already have observed
sneezing and pawmarks? Since both the cases of
convergent influences (sneezing and paw marks)
are noisy ORs with observed effects, explaining
away applies, that is they can be reduced to
negative influences between the causes. We can
generate a trace of the explanation thus:
Observe sneezing and paw-marks.
Impact of barking on cold?
1.

Observation of barking is

evidence for dog.
2. Increased probability of dog
helps explain paw marks, and so
weakens evidence for cat.
3. Reduced probability of cat
reduces probability of allergy.
4. Reduced probability of allergy
reduces ability to explain sneezing,
and so increases probability of
cold.
In summary, observation of barking
increases probability of cold.

This illustrates all three kinds of propagation. Step
1 involves simple diagnostic inference over a
positive influence. Step 2 involves intercausal
inference, producing a negative influence from dog
to cat. Step 3 involves simple predictive inference,
propagating negative evidence over a positive
influence. And step 4 involves intercausal
inference, producing another negative influence
from allergy to cold. Since there are two positive
steps and two negative steps (the intercausal
inferences), the chaining produces a cumulative
positive influence between barking and cold as
shown in Figure 6. We should point out that the
scheme as described is limited to singly
connected networks of binary variables.

4.3 An example of quaiHatlve propagation

We illustrate how these ideas may be applied to
provide qualitative explanation using the sneeze
example, somewhat like that provided by some of
our subjects. Consider question (c) from above,
how does observation of barking affect our belief

5 Scenario-based explanations

Whereas inference schemes using propagation
operate on a belief network representation of
knowledge, scenario-based explanations are
based on scenario trees (also known as probability
trees, or decision trees without the decision
variables). Each path from root to an end node
represents a scenario, or sequence of events.
The psychological literature suggests that it may
be easier to understand scenarios if they are
presented as coherent causal stories. So in an
attempt to make scenarios easier to grasp, we can
order the events in a scenario so that effects follow
their causes, and employs causal conjunctions to
link them when appropriate, for example:
No cold; cat causes allergy, which
causes sneezing.
Dog causes barking and paw marks; no
cat, hence no allergy; cold causes
sneezing.

In some scenarios, an event may deviate from
what is expected, having a low probability given
its predecessors. Even though a cat is present
there may be no allergic reaction. In such cases,
we can aid interpretation by indicating such
surprises by an exception conjunction such as
"but" for an event with low conditional probability:
No cold; cat,
no sneezing.

but no allergy,

hence

The probability of each scenario is the product of
the conditional probabilities of all the events in it.
Exact Bayesian inference to find the posterior
probability of an event can be performed by
looking at the ratio of the sum of the probabilities
of all scenarios compatible with the event to the
sum of all those not compatible, after eliminating
all scenarios not consistent with the observations.
The number of possible scenarios is generally
large of course, and cognitively unmanageable.
But fortunately, it is often possible to understand
the essentials of what is going on by examining
only a few of the most probable scenarios.
The following is a simple scenario-based
explanation from the sneeze example. We ask it
to explain the probability assigned to cold given
sneezing has been observed:

less likely than no cold in B
(0. 08/0. 92) '
although no cat in A is a great deal
more likely than cat in B (0. 9/0. 1) .
Therefore cold is slightly more
likely than not (p=0. 52) .

QIQ first displays what is known and what can be
definitely inferred from it. It then gives a list of one
or more scenarios which are compatible with the
target variable (cold) and a second list of
scenarios which are incompatible with it. Since
currently our only observation is sneezing, the
variables paw marks, dog, and barking are
irrelevant, and so the scenarios mention only cold,
cat, and allergy.
In general there may be a vast number of possible
scenarios (exponential in the number of uncertain
variables), so it only gives the most probable
one(s) in each list. The rest are grouped as "other
less probable scenario(s)", those which collectively
contribute less than 15% of the overall probability
for that list. This parameter can be varied to
control the length and precision of the explanation.
The next part of the explanation compares the
probabilities of the most important pairs of
scenarios in terms of significant differences in the
probabilities of their component events. Any
contrasts that are significant (probabilities differing
by a factor of more than 1 .2 in the default option)
are mentioned in explaining the relative
probabilities. The explanation lists, after
"because", the contrasts favoring the more
probable s�enario, and then, after "although", the
contrasts, if any, supporting the other scenario.
This scheme is based on the principle that it is
easier to judge the relative probability of two
scenarios by comparing their differences than by
judging their absolute probabilities. The
co'!lparisons use the relative probability phrases
calibrated against numerical probability differences
by Elsaesser & Henrion (1990). In this case the

relatively low probability of cold in scenario A is
just about balanced by the low probability of cat in
scenario B. Another possible scenario which has
both cold and cat (hence allergy) is not even
mentioned, because having two very unlikely
events its relative probability is negligible relative
to the two scenarios each with a single unlikely
event. So, it is contained in the "other less
probable scenario(s)" group.
A second example explanation assumes that paw
marks and barking as well as sneezing have been
observed:
why

cold

Given:
Sneezing must have been caused by
cold or allergy.
Paw Marks could have been caused by
cat or dog or another unknown cause.
Barking must have been caused by
dog.
The following scenario(s) are
compatible with cold:
A. Cold and no cat hence no
0. 38
allergy and dog
B. Cold and cat causing allergy
and dog
0. 05
Other less probable scenario(s) 0.01
Total probability of cold

0. 44

The following scenario(s) are
incompatible with cold:
C. No Cold and cat causing
allergy and dog

0. 56

Scenario A is much more likely than
scenario B (0. 38/0. 05)
because no cat in A is a great deal
more likely than cat in B
(0.90/0. 10) .
Scenario A is somewhat less likely
than scenario C (0. 38/0. 56)
because cold in A is a great deal
less likely than no cold in C
(0. 08/0.92) 1
although no cat in A is a great deal
more likely than cat in C
(0. 90/0. 10) .
Therefore cold is fairly unlikely
(p=0. 44) .

Note that several techniques are provided to
abstract and simplify the explanation. First, only

relevant events are considered, that is events
whose consideration affects the target probability
given available observations. Second, only those
scenarios that contribute more than 10% of the
probability to the target event (or its complement)
are listed explicitly. This can·drastically simplify the
explanation, since many real cases seem to be
like the example above, where a few (two to four)
scenarios turn out to have the bulk of the
probability, and the vast mass can be ignored
without significant error. Thirdly, in comparisons of
the relative probability of pairs of scenarios, only
those events with substantially different
probabilities are mentioned.
Additional abstraction techniques could provide
further simplification. Some linked variables might
be combined so that they can be treated as one.
For example, allergy might be combined into cat,
considering cat to cause sneezing directly. This
reduction of variables can reduce the number of
distinct scenarios and also the complexity of each
scenario. Another improvement in a decision
context would be to consider the importance of a
scenario in terms of expected utility rather than
simply probability. In a medical context, low
probability scenarios leading to death may have a
stronger claim to be listed explicitly than higher
probability scenarios with less interesting
consequences.
There is considerable psychological evidence for
the prevalence of scenario-based reasoning in
human thinking, and of the importance of
coherent, causal stories (e.g. Pennington & Hastie,
1988). The psychological literature has focussed
generally on the ways in which this leads to
systematic distortions and biases in probabilistic
judgment. Our approach here is to generate
explanations matched to human preferences for
explanatory stories, but to select and present the
scenarios in such a way that they provide a
reasonable guide to the relative probabilities of
interest.

6 Conclusions
We have outlined a variety of approaches to
explaining probabilistic knowledge, including
combinations of graphic, textual, and numeric
information, and two new schemes for explaining
probabilistic reasoning. Any specific explanation
will be too verbose for some, too brief for others,
and simply confusing for yet others. The art in
designing a good explanation is to match the style
and focus to the skills and interests of the person
to whom you are explaining. Users are generally
the best judge of their preferences and interests,
and so it is important to provide them with levers to

19

control the style and completeness, such as the
probability cut-off parameters mentioned in
scenario generation. Providing both phrases and
numbers should please most people, and may
even give numerophobes the opportunity to
become familiar with the relationships.

This paper summarizes work from an initial
exploratory phase of our research program into
explaining probabilistic reasoning. There is
considerable scope for developing and refining of
these techniques. Initial experimental evaluation
suggests the value of such explanations in
improved user insight (Druzdzel, 1990). But a
more definitive understanding of the merits of such
schemes must await more extended empirical
comparisons of their effectiveness under a variety
of conditions.
