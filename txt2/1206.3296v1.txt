modes [14].
Aside of the independences that are imposed by the
model’s structure, often there exist additional independences stemming from the specific values of the
functions. These independences are not systematically exploited by the traditional inference algorithms,
resulting in an unnecessary computational cost. For
such non-structural independences we use the name
context-specific independence (CSI), which was suggested in previous studies [2, 20]. We note that the
term CSI takes here a more general meaning as it is
not restricted to any specific type of independence.
Several studies have suggested changes in the traditional representation of graphical models in order
to capture context-specific independences. These include similarity networks suggested by Heckerman
(1991) [12], multinets (Geiger & Heckerman 1996) [9],
asymmetric influence diagrams (Fung and Shachter
1990) [8], and structured representations of the functions ψ based on decision trees (Boutilier et al.
1996 [2], Poole& Zhang 2003 [20]). Other studies resorted to revised representations for specific functions
(e.g. Quickscore algorithm by Heckerman 1989 for
noisy-OR functions [11]).

Although the new representations proved useful from
an empirical view point, they lack the ability to encompass a wide variety of CSI. In addition, the theoretical
complexity of inference using these representation remained a function only of the topology of the graph
underlying the model.
In this paper we approach the problem of inference
from a more general perspective. We introduce a set of
models called multiplicative models in which the functions ψ that account for the dependency of variables
are in a multiplicative representation, where a value of
an instance is a product over a set of parameters. We
show that multiplicative models generalize over loglinear models, factor graphs, and graphical models. In
addition, we show that multiplicative models can capture multiple forms of CSI, including CSIs captured
via decision trees, decision graphs, and via noisy-OR
functions. This leads to the question whether an inference algorithm that takes advantage of these independences can be constructed without additional cost.
We provide such an algorithm, and show how different
types of independences are utilized in this procedure to
reduce the needed computations. The inference algorithm provided herein simplifies over the inference algorithm suggested by Poole & Zhang (2003) [20] when
applied to Bayesian networks, by avoiding the use of
tables and tables splitting operations. The more general nature of the algorithm also enables it to deal
with different representations, and thus account for
CSI that can not be represented by decision trees and
decision graphs.
We prove the correctness of the inference procedure
and give a new notion of complexity instead of the
exponent of the tree-width which is commonly used
to describe the complexity of inference in graphical
models. The new time complexity is shown to be less
than or equal to the standard complexity.

Multiplicative models

We propose a generalization of graphical models, factor graphs and log-linear models which represents the
dependency of variables in the model via the notion
of multiplicative models. In these models a value of
an instance in the dependency function is a product
over a specific set of parameters. The definition relies
on the concept of a lattice. A lattice (L, E, ∩, ∪) is
a partially ordered set (poset) with respect to some
relation E, in which for every two elements l1 , l2 ∈ L
their least upper bound is denoted as l1 ∩ l2 and their
greatest lower bound is denoted as l1 ∪ l2 .
We usually use upper case letters to denote random
variables and sets of random variables, and lower case
letters to denote their values. For a variable V we

denote its domain, or the set of possible values it can
get, by dom(V ). For a set of variables D = {Vi }ni=1 ,
the notation dom(D) corresponds to the cross product
of the domains dom(Vi ), i = 1, . . . , n.
Let D = {Vi }ni=1 be a set of n multivalued variables,
and let the function ψ(D) : dom(D) → R specify the
values in a full table for the set D, then the following
is a definition for a mapping function of D.
Definition 1 (Mapping function) A function f is
called a mapping function of D with respect to the lattice L, if it is defined as f : dom(Z) → L for every
Z ⊆ D, and maps partial instances Z = z onto L.
We use this definition to define a lattice multiplicative
model of ψ(D).
Definition 2 (Lattice multiplicative model)
A model ρ = {Sρ , Γρ } of a function ψ(D) is
called a lattice multiplicative model with respect
to a lattice (L, E, ∩, ∪) and a mapping function
f , if Sρ ⊆ L, QΓρ = {γs ∈ R : s ∈ Sρ } and
ψ(D = d) =
γs .
sEf (d),s∈Sρ

The set Sρ is called the structure of the model, and
the set Γρ is called the parameters of the model. In
multiplicative models elements s ∈ S for which γs = 1
can be removed from S.
Here we focus on a lattice L which is a set of propositional clauses over the variables and their values, and
call this model a propositional multiplicative model,
or simply a multiplicative model. In this model, the
operators on the lattice are ∧ and ∨. The mapping
function used for this model is called the propositional
mapping function, and is defined as follows.
Definition 3 (Propositional mapping function)
A mapping function f is called a propositional mapping function of D with respect to the lattice L, if
for every set Z ⊆ D the function mapsVevery partial
instance Z = z into the conjunction
(Vi = vi ),
Vi ∈Z

where vi is the projection of z onto the variable Vi .
Definition 4 (Propositional multiplicative model)
A lattice multiplicative model ρ = {Sρ , Γρ } of a function ψ(D) is called a propositional multiplicative
model with respect to a lattice (L, , ∧, ∨) and a
propositional mapping function f , if the elements of
L are propositional clauses over the variables in D
and for two clauses c and c0 we denote c  c0 if c is
implied by c0 .
Example 1 Consider a set D which contains two
ternary variables A and B. The corresponding lattice

contains propositional clauses over A and B, and for
the two clauses c = (A = 0) and c0 = (A = 0)∧(B = 2)
we denote c  c0 . The corresponding mapping function
maps the instance A = 0, B = 2 into the propositional
clause (A = 0) ∧ (B = 2), and the partial instance
A = 0 into the clause (A = 0).
In this definition, the standard model which uses fulltable representations of the functions ψ(D), such as
graphical models, and handles each instance separately, is also a multiplicative model with the set S
containing all mapping f (d) of instances D = d, and
with values γd = ψ(d).
Another well-known model that falls into Definition 2
is the log-linear model.
2.1

Log-linear models

Log-linear models are usually used to analyze categorical data, and are a direct generalization of undirected
graphical models. These models that have been heavily used for statistical analysis for the past four decades
describe the association patterns among a set of categorical variables without specifying any variable as
a response (dependent) variable, treating all variables
symmetrically [1].
Formally, a log-linear model specifies the natural log
of the expected frequency of values d for a set of variables D as a linear combination of the main effect λVvii
of every variable Vi ∈ D, and if |D| > 1 interaction effects λSs of every subset of variables S ⊆ D, where the
instances s are consistent with d. For example, suppose that we want to investigate relationships between
three categorical variables, A, B and C, then the full
log-linear model is
B
C
AB
AC
BC
ABC
ln(Fa,b,c ) = µ+λA
a +λb +λc +λab +λac +λbc +λabc

where µ is the overall mean of the natural log of the
expected frequencies.
Clearly in the log-linear models instances are partially
ordered by inclusion of their sets and by consistency
of instantiations. To formalize log-linear models as a
multiplicative models, for every subset Z ⊆ D and for
Z
every instantiation Z = z such that
V λz 6= 0, the set S
contains all clauses of the form
(V = v), where v

els that can potentially reduce the amount of work
needed for inference [12, 9]. The notion of ContextSpecific Independence (CSI) was then introduced by
Smith et al. (1993) [23] and Boutilier et al. (1996) [2].
Context-specific independence corresponds to regularities within probabilistic models based on the values
assigned in the model.
Formally, we say that the sets of variables X and Y
are contextually independent in the context of C = c
given Z if
(1)
P (X, Y |Z = z, C = c) =
P (X|Z = z, C = c) · P (Y |Z = z, C = c)
for every value Z = z. One aspect of this equation is
that if X and Y are contextually independent given
Z, then
P (X|Y = y1 , Z = z, C = c) = P (X|Y = y2 , Z = z, C = c)
(2)
for any two values y1 , y2 of Y , which appear as repetitive values in conditional probability tables, such as
those used in BNs. These repetition which are the basis of compact representations like decision trees and
graphs were exploited for inference in BN [2, 20].
Another kind of CSI which was exploited for enhanced
inference in BNs is the independence in noisy-OR functions. A noisy-OR function is a conditional probability function of a binary effect variable E given a set
of m binary cause variables C = {C1 , . . . , Cm }. The
conditional probabilities
Q of the function are P (E =
0|C1 , . . . , Cm ) = c0
P (E = 0|Ci ), where c0 is a
i:Ci =1

constant, and the values P (E = 0|Ci ) are some real
numbers.
For any particular CSI of the sets of variables X and Y
in the context C = c given the set Z, as in Eq. 1, there
exists a multiplicative model that captures this independence. Such a model is any multiplicative model
where the structure does not contain elements s that
involve variables from X and Y , such that there exists
an instance Z = z for which s ∧ (Z = z) = ⊥ and
s ∧ (C = c) 6= ⊥.
We now define two types of multiplicative models that
capture two different types of common CSIs.

V ∈Z

is the projection of z onto the variable V . In addition,
we set the parameters of the model to γ> = eµ and
S
γf (s) = eλs .
2.2

Context-specific independence

With the introduction of graphical models and in particular Bayesian Networks (BNs), and the proof that
inference in these models is NP-hard [4], several studies looked for further independences encoded in mod-

2.2.1

Positive models

Representing the dependency of variables using loglinear models has some desirable properties, such as
being general while ensuring the existence of a maximum likelihood without enforcing dependencies to be
strictly positive. However, in the representation discussed in Section 2.1 the log-linear models use more
parameters than necessary [3, 13]. Take for example
the log-linear model for two binary variables A and B.

Assuming all possible effects exist, the corresponding
log-linear model uses eight parameters rather than the
four parameters in a standard representation as a full
A
B

AB
table: λA
0 , λ1 , λ0 , λ1 , λ00 , λ01 , λ10 , λ11 .
Another representation of the log-linear models that
accounts for these redundancies uses only parameters
which involve non-zero instantiations of variables [10].
In the above example the only parameters used in
B
AB
this representation are: λA
1 , λ1 , λ11 . We describe this
representation of log-linear models as a multiplicative
model, which we call here the positive model.
Definition 5 (Positive model) A positive model ρ
of a function ψ(D) is a multiplicative model wrt to
the lattice (L, , ∧, ∨) and a (propositional) mapping
function f in which Sρ contains only elements s = f (z)
where Z ⊆ D and no variable in Z = z is set to zero.
Log-linear models, and thus positive models, are
known to capture conditional and contextual independences [16].
Example 2 An example is a function ψ over two
binary variables A and B where ψ(0, 0) · ψ(1, 1) =
ψ(0, 1) · ψ(1, 0). This implies that A is independent
of B and the function can be written as ψ(A, B) =
ψ(A) · ψ(B). In the corresponding positive model the
parameter γ(A=1)∧(B=1) = ψ(0,0)·ψ(1,1)
ψ(0,1)·ψ(1,0) = 1. Thus, this
independence is captured in the model.

of ψ(d = v1 v2 · · · vm vm+1 · · · vn ), where Vj = vj for
m < j ≤ n is any possible value of Vj . We note that
in a decision tree every instance D = d is mapped to a
single path in the tree. An example of a decision tree
that encodes a function over the variables A, B, C, D
is shown in Figure 1.
One can choose to use decision graphs [18] instead of
decision trees. These are more compact structures that
can encode for more distributions. For a function ψ(D)
over a set of variables D, a decision graph G that represents ψ(D) is a directed graph with sets of variables
from D at internal nodes and values from ψ(D) at the
leaves. Similar to decision trees, every edge from a set
of variables W to a child Z corresponds to a different
set of values H ⊆ dom(W
), and can be represented
W
as a set of clauses
(W = w). A value at the end
w∈H

of a path p equals to the value of ψ(d), where d is an
instance of D consistence with the sets of values encoded by p. Again, as in decision trees, we note that
in a decision graph every instance D = d is mapped to
a single path in the graph.
Definition 6 (Decision-graph model) A decision
graph model ρ of a function ψ(D) is a multiplicative
model wrt to the lattice (L, , ∧, ∨) and a mapping
function f where everyWtwo elements s1 , s2 ∈ Sρ satisfy s1 ∧ s2 = ⊥, and
s = >, where ⊥ = f alse and
s∈S

> = true.
Example 3 In a more complex function with three binary variables A, B and C, every pair of variables is
independent whenever the third variable is set to zero.
For this function the corresponding positive model assigns γ(V =1)∧(U =1) = 1 for every pair of variables
V, U ∈ {A, B, C} and where V 6= U .
2.2.2

Decision trees and graphs as
multiplicative models

Common structures for representing functions with
contextual independence are decision trees (DTs) and
decision graphs (DGs) [22, 18]. These structures capture contextual independences that are the result of
repetitive values, as specified in Eq. 2. Several studies
have used decision trees to enhance inference in graphical models [2, 20]. We show how DTs and DGs fall
into the category of multiplicative models.
For a function ψ(D) over a set of variables D, a decision tree T that represents ψ(D) is a tree with variables
from D at internal nodes and values from ψ(D) at the
leaves. Every edge from a variable V to a child in T
corresponds to a different set of values H W
⊆ dom(V ),
and can be represented as a set of clauses
(V = v).
v∈H

A value at the end of a path p = v1 → v2 → · · · → vm ,
where vi is some value of Vi , equals to the value

For a specific decision graph G that represents ψ(D),
the decision graph model of G is ρ(G) in which the
structure contains one clause for every path from the
root to a leaf in G, which is a conjunction of the clauses
on the edges. For every such path s, we set γs to
the value at the end of the path. We note that in
this model for every instance D = d there is only one
element s ∈ Sρ such that s  f (d).

Inference for multiplicative models

Consider a model that Q
encodes for the probability distribution P (x) =
i ψi (di ), with sets Di =
{Xi1 , . . . Ximi }, and multiplicative models ρi =
{Si , Γi } over all the functions ψi (Di ) wrt a lattice
(L, , ∧, ∨). We first show how to perform inference,
and compute a probability of a set of query variables Q
using a multiplicative model. In particular we perform
inference for a multiplicative model via the variable
elimination scheme (Zhang & Poole 1996 [24], Dechter
1999 [5]) which was originally suggested for inference
in BNs. Then, we prove the correctness of the algorithm and analyze its time complexity.
We define an operation M (V, {ρi }), which given a variable V ∈ X and a set of models {ρi }, i = 1, . . . , m over
X returns a model ρ0 over the variables X \ V . This

operator is analogous to marginalization in standard
inference algorithms. In addition, for a model ρ we define a relevance indicator Is (V ) for each element s ∈ Sρ
and each variable V in D, which is set to 1 if there exists a pair of instances d1 , d2 of D that differ only by
the value of V and for which s  f (d1 ) but s  f (d2 ).
Otherwise, Is (V ) is set to 0.
These operations allow us to write an inference procedure which computes the probability of a set of query
variables in a multiplicative model as in Algorithm 1.
The algorithm operates like the bucket-elimination algorithm [5], where given an order on the variables we
iterate over them (Line 2), and marginalize out one
variable at a time (Line 9). Only elements that include
terms that involve the current variable are considered
in the marginalization.

Now, lets examine what the algorithm encodes for
after removing variable V , and show that it equals
Eq. 3. While the elements that do not involve variable V are not changed, the elements that do involve

models, this operation is equivalent to the operation
of tables’ multiplication, often denoted as ⊗. In these
models the set R is the set of instances in the table
after marginalization.
We note that for some models, like graphical models,
lines 2-5 are trivial, and are executed implicitly, since
the elements in R are known
S to be all instances of a
full-table over variables in Si .
3.1

Correctness of the inference procedure

We prove the correctness of Algorithm 1 by showing
that the algorithm maintains the property that after
iterating over the set of variables U , the models ρi =
{Si , Γi } encode to the probability distribution P (X \
U ).
At the beginning of the algorithm every model ρi represents the corresponding function ψi (Di ). Thus,
P (X = x) =

From lines 2-5 in Algorithm 2, there is one element
r∗  f (x0 ) in R for which ∀r ∈ R such that r  f (x0 )
also satisfies r  r∗ . First, to show there is such an
element r∗ we recall from Line
V 5 that all elements in
R can be written as r =
ri , where ri ∈ Ri , and
1≤i≤t

Ri is the closure of Si under the operator ∧. Consider
the set of elements ri∗  f (x0 ), i = 1, . . . , t, for which

all other elements ri ∈ Ri such that rV
i  f (x ) satisfy

ri  ri . Then, every element r =
ri such that
1≤i≤t

r  f (x0 ) also satisfies r  r∗ .
Now, assume by contradiction that there were two such
elements, r1∗ , r2∗ ∈ R. Then from the definition of r1∗
and r2∗ we get r1∗  r2∗ and r2∗  r1∗ , yielding r1∗ = r2∗ .
Thus, from line 9 in Algorithm 2

the terms of Algorithm 1 the set {s : s  (r∗ ∧ (V =

γs
β(x0v ) =
i sf (x0 ),s∈Si ,Is (V )=1

and from Eq. 3 we get P̂ (x0v ) = P (x0v ). Namely, the
new models encode for P (X 0 \ V ).
3.2

Incorporating evidence

In many practical scenarios we observe the value of
some of the variables in the model, and wish to incorporate this evidence. The multiplicative models allow
us to do so in a most natural way. Consider a set
E of evidence nodes for which we observed the values
E = e, and a multiplicative model ρ = {Sρ , Γρ }. Then,
in order to incorporate the evidence
into ρ, we adjust
V
(V = v), where v is the
the elements in Sρ by s = s
V ∈E

projection of e onto the variable V ∈ E. Then, we remove every element not consistent with the evidence,
s = ⊥.
3.3

Complexity of inference

It is well known that the complexity of inference in
graphical models is NP-hard and its cost exponential
in the tree-width of the underlying graph [4].
We analyze the time complexity of the inference procedure for multiplicative models given in Algorithm 1.
As a by-product we refine the standard complexity and
provide a new complexity bound which is based on
the representation used. One can then say that the
complexity of the problem is the minimum complexity
among all possible representations.
3.3.1

Diameter of multiplicative models

The structure of a multiplicative model determines the
amount of computations needed to obtain the value
ψ(d) of a single instantiation of values to variables in
a set D. Although at first glance it seems that for
a model ρ = {S, Γ} of a function ψ(D) the number
of operations needed to obtain
Pvalues of all instances
D = d amounts to a total of
|{s : s  d}|, the real
D=d

number of operations can be dramatically lower and we
denote it by δ(ρ). For hierarchical models, in which
if an element s is not in the structure of the model
then all elements s  s0 are also not in the model,
Good (1963) provides a method that computes all such
values in time |S| log |S| [10]. We denote the ratio
between the number of computations and the number
of elements in S, which is the size of the model, by
diam(ρ) = δ(ρ)
|S| and name it the diameter of ρ.
From a computational perspective, it is clearly beneficial to use models with a small diameter, as this

directly leads to fewer operations whenever we want
to either obtain a value of ψ or update the values γs .
Examples of models with a diameter of 1 are graphical
models and decision graph models, in which for every
element s ∈ S, the only element s0 such that s0  s,
is s itself. On the other hand, the diameter of a positive model can be as high as log2|S| . This maximum
is achieved for a positive model of m binary variables,
when all 2m parameters do not equal one, and hence
all possible elements are in S. In this scenario the
diameter is exactly m
2.
Although in the worst scenario the diameter of a positive model can be large, often this is not the case, and
the diameter is typically bounded to be very small.
Example 4 Consider as an example the Potts
model [21] in which a function ψ(D) over a set
DQ
= {Vi }ni=1 decomposes according to ψ(D = d) =
c0 ψ(vi , vj ), where vi and vj are projections of d
i,j

onto the variables Vi and Vj respectively, and c0 is a
constant. Although in general a positive model over n
binary variables has a diameter of n2 , in this example,
the structure of the positive model includes only elements that involve at most two variables. Therefore,
the diameter of the model is bounded by two.
Similarly, in a more complex scenario where the function ψ decomposes to functions of k-tuples of variables,
the diameter will be bounded by k.
Consider a tree decomposition of the graph in which
there is an edge between a pair of variables V, U if
there exists an element s in one of the models for which
Is (V ) · Is (U ) = 1. We denote by S(W ) = {s ∨ (X \ Z) :
s ∈ Si } the set of parts of elements in the models ρi
that involve variables from the set of graph vertices
Z which is mapped onto the tree node W . Further
denoting as S − (W ) the closure of S(W ) under the
operator ∧, we say that complexity of the algorithm for
this tree decomposition is the maximum over the nodes
W in the tree of |S − (W )| · diam(S − (W )), as described
in Section 3.3.1. Then, the overall complexity of the
algorithm is the complexity for the tree decomposition
that yields the minimum for this term.
To see that this is indeed the time complexity of the
algorithm, consider the elements in a set R in Algorithm 2. The number of elements there does not exceed the number of elements in S − (W ) for the corresponding tree decomposition and where W maps onto
the variables that appear in R. Most of the computation stems from computing the products in Line 9,
and these can be done for the entire set of elements
of R in time proportional to |R| · diam(R). Therefore,
having the ability to choose an elimination order, the
complexity of the algorithm is |S − (W )|·diam(S − (W ))

maximized over all nodes W in a tree decomposition
and minimized over all possible such decompositions.

Benefits of inference for multiplicative
models

Different multiplicative models capture different contextual independences, hence specifying different number of parameters. Take for example the function over
four binary variables A, B, C, D with values according
to the table in Figure 1. The structure of the corresponding decision-tree model contains six elements
while the structure of the corresponding positive model
contains eight elements. In this latter model, the CSI
captured in the decision tree, yielding the value of ψ
to be independent of B given that A, C and D are set
to one, does not have any effect. This variation and
the structure of the model affect the run time of the
inference algorithm.
