The currently most efficient algorithm for inference with a
probabilistic network is the junction-tree propagation al­
gorithm that builds upon a triangulation of a network's
moralised graph [1, 2]. The running time of this algorithm
depends on the triangulation used. In general, it is hard to
find a triangulation for which this running time is minimal.
As there is a strong relationship between the running time
of the algorithm and the maximum of the triangulation's
clique sizes, for real-life networks triangulations are sought
for which this maximum is minimal. The minimum of the
maximum clique size over all triangulations of a graph is
a well-studied notion, both by researchers in the field of
probabilistic networks and by researchers in graph theory
and graph algorithms. In the latter field of research, the no­
tion of treewidth is used to denote this minimum minus one.
Unfortunately, computing the treewidth of a given graph is
an NP-complete problem [3].
When solving hard combinatorial problems, pre-process­
is often profitable. The basic idea is to reduce the size

ing

of the problem under study, using relatively little compu­
tation time and without losing optimality. The smaller,
and presumably easier, problem is subsequently solved. In
this paper, we discuss pre-processing for triangulation of
probabilistic networks. We provide a set of rules for step­
wise reducing the problem of finding a triangulation for a
network's moralised graph with minimal maximum clique
size, to the same problem on a smaller graph. Various al­
gorithms can then be used to solve the smaller problem.
Given a triangulation of the smaller graph, a triangulation
of the original graph is obtained by reversing the reduction
steps. Our reduction rules are guaranteed not to destroy op­
timality with respect to maximum clique size. Experiments
with pre-processing revealed that our rules can effectively
reduce the problem size for various real-life probabilistic
networks. In fact, the graphs of some well-known networks
are triangulated optimally just by pre-processing.
In this paper, we do not address the second phase in the pre­
processing approach outlined above, that is, we do not ad­
dress actually constructing triangulations with a minimal or
close to minimal maximum clique size. Recent research re­
sults indicate, however, that for small graphs optimal trian­
gulations can be feasibly computed. Building upon a vari­
ant of an algorithm by Amborg, Corneil, and Proskurowski
[3], K. Shoikhet and D. Geiger performed various exper­
iments on randomly generated graphs [4]. Their results
indicate that this algorithm allows for computing optimal
triangulations of graphs with up to I 00 vertices.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review
some basic definitions. In Section 3, we present our pre­
processing rules. The computational model in which these
rules are employed, is discussed in Section 4. In Section
5, we report on our experiments with well-known real-life
probabilistic networks. The paper ends with some conclu­
sions and directions for further research in Section 6.

triangulation of the moralisation of the digraph o f a proba­
bilistic network. We review the basic definitions involved.
Let G
(V, A) be a directed acy clic graph. The moral­
isation of G is the undirected graph M(G) obtained from
G by adding edges between everypair ofnon-adjacent ver­
t i ces that have a common successor (vertices v and w have
a common s ucc essor if there is a vertex x with ( v, x) E A
a nd (w, x) E A), and then dropping the arcs' directions.
=

Let G
(V, E) be an undirected graph. A set of vertices
W � V is called a clique in G if there is an edge between
every pair of disjoint vertices from W; the cardinality of
W is the clique's size. For a set of vertices W � V, the
subgraph induced by W is the graph G[WJ = (W, (W x
W) n E); for a single vertex v, we write G- v to denote
G[V - {v}]. The graph G is triangulated if it does not
contain an induced subgraph that is a simple cycle of length
at least four. A triangulation of G is a triangulated graph
H (G) that contains G as a sub graph. The treewidth of the
triangulation H (G) of G is the maximum clique size in
H (G) minus 1. The treewidth of G, denoted r (G), is the
minimum treewidth over all triangulations of G.
=

graph H is a minor of a graph G if H can be obtained
from G by zero or more vertex deletions, edge deletions,
and edge contractions (edge c ontra cti on is the operation
that replaces two adjacent vertices v and w by a single ver­
tex that is connected to all neighbours of v and w). It is
well known (see for example [5]), that the treewidth of a
minor of Gis never larger than the treewidth of G itself.

A

of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a
bijection V t-t {1, . . . , jVI}. For v E V and a linear or­
dering f of G- v, we denote by (v;f) the linear ordering
F of G that is obtained by addingv at the beginning off,
that is,f'(v)
1 and, for all w =/= v, F(w)
f(w) + 1.
A linear ordering f is a perfect elimination scheme for G
if, for each v E V, its higher ordered neighbours form a
clique, that is, if every pair of distinct verti ces in the set
{wE V I {v, w} E E and f(v) < f(w)} is adjacent. It is
well known (see for example [6]), that a graph is triangu­
lated if and only if it allows a perfect elimination scheme.

Safe reduction rules

Pre-processing a probabilistic network for triangulation
builds upon a set of reduction rules. Th ese rules allow for
stepwise reducing a network's moralised graph to another
graph with fewer vertices. The steps applied during the re­
duction can be reversed, thereby enabling us to compute a
triangulation of the original graph from a triangulation of
the smaller graph. In this section, we discuss the various
rules; a discussion ofthe computational method in which
these rules are employed, is deferred to Section 4.
During a graph's reduction, we maintain a stack of elimi­
nated vertices and an integer low that gives a lower bound
for the treewidth of the original graph. Application of a re­
duction rule serves to modify the current graph G to G' and
to possibly update low to low'. We say that the rule is safe
if max(r(G), low)
m ax(r(G') , low'). By applying safe
rules, therefore, we have as an invariant that the treewidth
of the original graph equals the maximum ofthe treewidth
ofthe reduced graph and the value low. In the sequel, we
assume that the original moralised graph has at least one
edge and that low is initialised at 1.
=

Our first reduction rule applies to simplicial vertices. A
vertex v is simplicial in an undirected graph G if the neigh­
bours ofv form a clique in G.
Lemma 1 Let

G

simplicial vertex in

G with degree d ;::: 0. Then,

=

For a graph G and a linear ordering f of G, thereis a unique
minimal triangulation H (G) of G that has f forits perfect
elimination scheme. This triangulation, which we term the
fill-in given j, can be constructed by, fori
1, ... , !VI,
turning the set of higher numbered neighbours of f-1 (i)
into a clique. The maximum clique size minus 1 of this
fill-in is called the treewidth of f. The treewidth of a lin­
ear ordering of a triangulated graph equals the maximum
number of higher numbered neighbours of a vertex [ 6].
=

To conclude, a junction tree of an undirected graph G =
(V, E) is a tree T = (I, F), where every node i E I
has associated a vertex set Vi, such that the following two
properties hold: the set {Vi I i E I} equals the set

Proof. Since G contains a clique of size d + 1, we have
that r(G) ;::: d. We further observe that r(G) ;::: r(G - v),
because G - v is a minor of G. We therefore have that
r(G) ;::: max(d, r(G- v )) . Now, let f be a linear ordering
of G-v of treewidth k:::; max(d, r(G- v)). Let H be the
fill-in of G- v given f. Adding vertex v and its (formerly)
incident edges to H yields a graph H' that is still triangu­
lated: as every pair of neighbours of vis adjacent, v cannot
belong to a simple (ch ordless ) cycle of length at least four.
The maximum clique size of H' therefore equals the maxi­
mum ofd+1andk+l. Hence,r(G) � max(d,r(G-v)),
from which we conclude the first property stated in the
lemma. To prove the second property, we observe that the
linear ordering (v; f) is a perfect elimination scheme for
H', as removal of v upon computing the fill-in of H' does

Figure 1: The simplicial vertex rule.

Because the digraph G of a probabilistic network is
moralised before it is triangulated, it is likely to give rise
to many simplicial vertices. We consider a vertex v with
outdegree zero in G. Since all neighbours of v have an arc
pointing into v, moralisation will connect every two neigh­
bours that are not yet adjacent, thereby effectively turning v
into a simplicial vertex. The simplicial vertex rule wiii thus
remove at least all vertices that have outdegree zero in the
network's original digraph. As every directed acyclic graph
has at least one vertex of outdegree zero, at least one reduc­
tion will be performed. As the reduced graph need not be
the moralisation of a directed acyclic graph, it is possible
that no further reductions can be applied.
/
The digraph G of a probabilistic network may also include
vertices with indegree zero and outdegree one. These ver­
tices will always be simplicial in the moralisation of G.
We consider a vertex v with indegree zero and a single arc
pointing into a vertex w. In the moralisation of G, w and
its (former) predecessors constitute a clique. As all neigh­
bours ofv belong to this clique, v is simplicial.
A special case of the simplicial vertex rule applies to ver­
tices of degree 1; it is termed the twig rule, after [7].
Reduction Rule la: Twig rule

Letv be a vertex of degree 1.
Removev.
The twig rule is based upon the observation that vertices of
degree one are always simplicial. Another special case is
the islet rule that serves to remove vertices of degree zero.
We would like to note that many heuristic triangulation al­
gorithms, such as the algorithm described in [8], remove
simplicial vertices.
Our second reduction rule applies to almost simplicial ver­
tices. A vertex v is almost simplicial in an undirected graph

Let G be an undirected graph and let v be an
almost simplicial vertex in G with degree d � 0. Let G' be
the graph that is obtained/rom G by turning the neighbours
ofv into a clique and then removing v. Then,

the linear ordering (v; f) of G, with f a linear or­
dering ofG' oftreewidth at most max(d,r(G')), has
treewidth at most max(d, r(G')).

Let w be a neighbour of v such that the other
neighbours of v form a clique. As we can obtain G' from
G by contracting the edge {v, w } , G' is a minor of G. We
therefore have that r(G') :-:; r(G). Now, let f be a linear
ordering ofG' of treewidthk :-:; max(d, r(G')). Let H be
the fill-in ofG' given f. If we add v and its (formerly) adja­

Let v be an almost simplicial vertex of degree d � 0.
If low � d, then
add an edge between every pair of non-adjacent
neighbours of v;
removev.
Building upon Lemma 2 we find that the almost simpli­
cial vertex rule is safe. Suppose that we have G and
low before, and G' and low1 after application of the rule.
Then, r(G') :-:; r(G), r(G) :-:; max(d,r(G')), and
d :-:; low = low1• We conclude that max(r(G),low)
max(r(G'),low1). Examples can be constructed, unfortu­
nately, that show that the rule is not safe for low < d.

As the series and triangle rules are special cases of the al­

most simplicial vertex rule, both are safe.
If the twig and islet rules cannot be applied to a non-empty
undirected graph, then the graph has treewidth at least two.
We can then set low to max.(low, 2). Note that from this ob­
servation we have that the islet and twig rules suffice for re­
ducing any graph of treewidth one to the empty graph. The

islet, twig and series rules suffice for reducing any graph of
treewidth two to the empty graph. So, if low ;::: 2 for a given
non-empty graph and the islet, twig and series rules cannot
be applied, then we know that the graph has treewidth at
least three. We can then set low to max{low, 3).
As for treewidths one and two, there is a set of rules that

We argued that application of our rules may reduce a net­
work's moralised graph to the empty graph. The computa­
tional method complements this reduction by its reversal,
thereby providing for the construction of a triangulation of
minimal treewidth. For networks that cannot be triangu­
lated optimally just by pre-processing, our rules are com­
bined with an algorithm that serves to find an optimal or
close to optimal triangulation of the reduced graph.
The computational method takes for its input the directed
acyclic graph G of a probabilistic network; it outputs a tri­
angulation of the moralisation of G. The method uses a
stack S to hold the eliminated vertices in the order in which
they were removed during the graph's reduction. Moreover,

graphs. If, after executing the steps I through 3, the re­
duced graph is empty, we can construct a triangulation of
minimal treewidth for the moralised graphjust by reversing
the various reduction steps, and further triangulation is not
necessary. This situation occurs, for example, if the origi­
nal graph is already triangulated or has treewidth at most 3.
The ALARM network gives another example: its moralised
graph has treewidth four and is reduced to the empty graph.
In step

2 of our computational method, each of the reduc­

tion rules is investigated to establish whether or not it can
be applied to the current (reduced) graph G'. As soon as
an applicable rule is found, it is executed. When analysing
the computational complexity of our method, it is readily
seen that investigating applicability of the various reduc­
tion rules is the main bottleneck, as all other steps (except
for the triangulation in step

4) take linear time [6].

Investigating applicability of the islet,

maximum cardinality search (denoted MCS) [10] and with

the

perfect-triangulation and minimal-triangulation vari­
breadth-first search (denoted LEX_p

ants of lexicographic

and LEX_M, respectively) [11]. We ran the three heuris­
tic algorithms on the original moralisations of the four net­
works and on the reduced graphs after employing the sets
of rules P R-1 through PR-4. The table reveals that, for
the MUNIN and ICEA networks, the heuristic algorithms
tend to yield a smaller treewidth from the reduced graphs
than from the original moralisations.

The table in addi­

tion shows that the further reduced a graph, the less com­
putation time is spent by the algorithms. As the time spent
on pre-processing is negligible, these results indicate that
pre-processing a probabilistic network is profitable, not just
with respect to the quality of the triangulation yielded but
also with respect to the computation time spent.
In our experiments we observed that the treewidths found
by the heuristic algorithms depend to a large extent on the
vertex with which the computation is started. To investigate
the effect of the starting vertex, we ran the three heuristic
algorithms a number of times every time starting with
,

different vertex. Table

Conclusions and further research

When solving hard combinatorial problems, pre-processing
is often profitable.

Based upon this general observation,

we designed a computational method that provides for pre­
processing of probabilistic networks for triangulation. Our
method exploits a set of rules for stepwise reducing the
problem of finding a triangulation of minimum treewidth
for a network's moralised graph to the same problem on a

From the triangulation of the smaller graph, a triangulation
of the original graph is obtained by reversing the reduction
steps. The reduction rules are guaranteed not to destroy
optimality with respect to maximum clique size.
Experiments with our pre-processing method revealed that
the graphs of some well-known real-life probabilistic net­
works can be triangulated optimally just by pre-processing.
The experiments further showed that heuristic triangula­
tion algorithms tend to yield better results for graphs that
are reduced by pre-processing than for the original graphs.
Moreover, the further reduced a graph, the less computa­
tion time is spent by the triangulation algorithms.

From

these observations, we conclude that pre-processing proba­
bilistic networks for triangulation is profitable.
