values, relying only on the

A logic of qualitative possibility is crucial if we wish to
derive consequences based on partial information. Given
some constraints on the relationship between certain propo­
sitions, certain other constraints may be required to hold on
any suitable possibility measure. A logical calculus permits
us to specify a partial (qualitative) possibility measure and
derive information implicit in the specification. We can rea­
son without requiring complete information. One such pos­
sibilistic logic is developed in (Farinas and Herzig 1991).

these include conditional approaches to default reasoning
(Lehmann 1989), <:·semantics (Pearl 1988), belief revision

(Gat"denfors 1988), counterfactuallogics (Lewis 1973) and

autoepistemic logic (Moore 1985; Levesque 1990). In the
next section we discuss qualitative possibility and present
the logics CO and CO*. We show how these logics may
be used to represent qualitative possibility. In Section 3,
we examine the connections between possibilistic logic and
some other systems for defeasible reasoning. Of particular
interest is the fact we can define a conditional for default
reasoning in terms of our possibility logics that is identical
to Pearl's (1988) conditional for e-semantics.

Representation of Possibility

Possibilistic Logic

Possibilistic logic has been developed to a great extent by
Dubois and Prade (see their (1988) for a survey). A possi­
bility measure II maps the sentences of LcPL into the real
interval [0, 1]. The value II(a) is intended to represent the
degree of possibility of a. We take this to represent the
amount of surprise associated with adopting a as an epis­
temic possibility. If II( a) = 1 there is no surprise (i.e., a
is consistent with the agent's beliefs), while II(a) = 0 in­
dicates that surprise is maximal (i.e., an agent would never
adopt a). A possibility measure must satisfy the following
three properties:
(a)
(b)
(c)

II(T) = 1
ll(l.) = 0
II(A VB) = max(II(A), II(B))

(N6) If B ?:

N(a) = 1- 11(-.a).
Qualitative necessity measures are discussed in (Dubois
and Prade 1991b; Farinas and Herzig 1991). Postulates are
proposed constraining the qualitative relationship a?: N /3,
which is read as "a is at least as necessary as /3." If we
define a?: N /3 to be true just when N(a)?: N(/3) for any
necessity measure N, then ?: N will satisfy the postulates for
qualitative necessity (in finite settings), and these relations
are the only ones that can be so-defined (Dubois 1986).
A qualitative necessity ordering is any ordering satisfying
these postulates:1

C then A 1\ B ?: N A 1\ C for all A

Qualitative possibility is defined by related postulates,
?:�r f3 meaning a is at least as possible as /3, or

with a

II(a ) ?: II(/3).

The relationship between these qualitative
relationships can be given as A?: N B iff-.B ?:�r ..,A.

Farinas and Herzig (1991) have axiomatized this notion
with a logic called qualitative possibility logic (QPL), in
which the relation �II' is incorporated as a conditional con­
nective. They also make an initial attempt to develop a
modal theory of possibility that uses only unary modal op­
erators in place of the conditional ?:�r· Unfortunately, the
resulting logic PL requires an infinite set of modal operators,
each corresponding to a unique member of the measure set
for II. Semantically, each operator is evaluated with respect
to a separate accessibility relation. This certainly permits
the expression of qualitative properties like a ?:�r /3, but
doesn't seem to reflect the qualitative nature of QPL or
other qualitative postulates. In particular, there is no modal
operator corresponding to (some degree of) possibility or
necessity. This appears to be the first logical axiomatization
of qualitative possibility and, as such, provides many of the
advantages we expect of a logical calculus. Furthermore,
they show QPL is equivalent to Lewis's {1973) logic VN.

2.2

A necessity measure N is a similar mapping, associating
with a a degree of necessity. We take N(a) to represent
the amount of surprise associated with giving up belief in
a (or the degree of entrenchment of a in a belief set; see
Section 4). If N(a) = 1 then a is fully entrenched and can
never be given up, while N(a) = 0 indicates that a is not
believed at all. Naturally, tbe degree of surprise associated
with giving up a belief a should be related to the degree
of surprise in accepting -.a as an epistemic possibility, for
giving up a is just accepting -.a as possible. Indeed, one
may define necessity measures using the identity

The Logics CO and CO•

We wish to provide a possible worlds semantics for quali­
tative possibility theory, taking our models to consist of a
set W of possible worlds and a binary accessibility rela­
tion R over W. Intuitively, W is the set of situations an
agent considers possible. We do not intend this to represent
epistemic possibility, for there will be worlds among this
set that are inconsistent with an agent's beliefs. Rather,
these are the set of worlds an agent could possibly consider
adopting, even if it changed its mind about certain beliefs
it currently possesses. For example, W could be the set of
physically or logically possible worlds (for an agent).
We take R to be a ranking of. these worlds according to
their degree ofpossibility or plausibility, the extent to which
an agent is willing to accept these worlds as epistemically
possible, or consistent with its beliefs. When wRv we
intend that vis at least as possible as w. Intuitively, when
v is more possible than w we can think of v as being "more
consistent" with an agent's current beliefs than w; or tbink
of v as a preferable, more plausible alternative state of
affairs for an agent to adopt should it be forced to choose
between the two.

We take as minimal requirements tbat R be reflexive and
transitive.2 Another requirement we adopt in this paper
is that of connectedness. In other words, any two states
of affairs must be comparable according to their degree of
possibility. If neither is more possible than the other, then
they are equally possible.

<>a v Oa. It is easy to verify Utat these connectives have
the fo1lowing truth conditions: <>a (Oa) is true at a wor1d if
a holds at some accessible (inaccessible) world; Da (Oa)

imally possible worlds in this ranking be precisely those
the agent considers not merely possible, but epistemically
possible (i.e., those worlds consistent with its beliefs). Al­
though we do not need to enforce this constraint to deal
with possibilistic logic, we will discuss how this can be
expressed in Section 3, and how beliefs are related to pos­
sibi1ity measures.
We now define a modal language with which we can ex­
press qualitative notions of possibility and necessity. Our
language L will be formed from a denumerable set P of
propositional variables, together with the connectives ....,,
:::), 0 and 5. The connectives/\, v and= are defined in
terms of these in the usual way. We use T and .i to denote
the identically true and false propositions, respectively. We
denote by LcPL the propositional sublanguage of L.

Definition (Boutilier 1991) A CO-model is a triple M �
(W, R, !{)}, where W is a set (of possible worlds), R
is a transitive, connected3 binary relation on W (the
accessibility relation), and V' maps P into 2w (I{)( A)
is the set of worlds where A is true).

A CO-model consists of a set of clusters of possible worlds

totally-ordered by R, where a cluster is a set of mutually ac­
cessible, or equally possible, worlds. In Figure 1 each large
circle represents such a cluster of worlds and the (transitive
closure o t) arrows indicate accessibility between clusters.
Sow can see bothu and v (wRu andwRv) but v cannot see
w. All worlds above the dashed line are inaccessible tow,
while all worlds below are accessible. Let M = (W, R, <p}
be a CO-model, with w E W. The truth of a formula a at
w in M is defined (for the interesting cases) as:

F=w

We often want to ensure that all logically possible worlds

in the context of belief revision (Boutilier 1992c) or au­

In our current setting, we can think of this as ensuring that
every logically possible world ts assigned some positive
degree of possibility. For this purpose we introduce the
logic co•, which is based on the class of CO-models in
which all propositional valuations are represented (see also
(Levesque 1990)).

A Modal Account

We now take up the task of providing a simple modal ac­
count of qualitative possibility and necessity. Recall that
a CO-structure orders worlds according to their degree of
possibility. This is much like another formulation of possi­
bilistic logic in terms of possibility distributions. A distri­
bution 1r assigns to each world a degree of possibility from
the interval [0, 1]. This too can be viewed as a ranking of
worlds, with w being at least as possible as v just when
1r(w) :;:: 1r(v), corresponding precisely to vRw in a CO­
model. A distribution determines a possibility measure II
via the following relationship:
II(A) = max {1r(w) :w F= A}.
In other words, the degree of possibility of A is just that of
the most possible A-world.
In our qualitative setting we need not determine the absolute
possibility of A, merely the relative possibility of pairs of
sentences. Quantitatively, A is at least as possible as B iff
the world of maximal possibility satisfying A (say w) is no
less possible than the most possible B-world (say v); that
is, 1r(w):;:: 1r(v). In a CO-structure this means vRw. So if
A is at least as possible as B, then it must be the case that
the minimal B-world in relation R can see the minimal A­
world.5 But, since vis a minimal B-world, all B-worlds see
v; therefore, any B-world can see w (since R is transitive
and connected). More generally, whenever A is at least
as possible as B, any B-world can see some A-world. In
our bimodal language this is expressed as D{B :J <>A):
whenever B holds, there is some more plausible world
satisfying A. We refer to this as a plausibility ordering (for
reasons discussed in the next section).
Definition Let M be a CO-model. The plausibility order­
ing determined by M is $PM· given by

A $PM B iff M F= D(B :J <>A).
A is at least as plausible as B iff A $PM B.6
4
For all wE W, w• is defined as the map from Pinto { 0,1 }
such that w• ( A )
1 iff w E 'P(A); in other words, w• is the
valuation associated with w.
'we are speaking loosely here, of course. World w is a minimal
A-world iff vRw for all A-worlds v. (Worlds minimal in R have
maximal plausibility.) In this case w is "less than" any such v
according to R, but (on our interpretation of R) has "greater"
possibility than v. Nothing about CO-structures presupposes the
existence of minimal A-worlds for any A, nor need they be unique
when they do exist. We use this manner of speaking for illustrative
purposes; but nothing of a technical nature depends on this.
6We use $PM to indicate greater plausibility rather than �PM
to remain consistent with (Grove 1988; Boutilier 1992a) and other
papers (where this operator is related to other concepts).
=

Figure 2: Entrenchment and Plausibility
The dual of such a relationship is qualitative necessity, and
we refer to this ordering as an entrenchment ordering (again,
explained in the next section).
Definition Let M be a CO-model. The entrenchment or­
dering determined by M is $EM, given by

B $EM A iff -,B $PM -,A.
A is at least as entrenched as B iff B $EM A.
It is easy to see that B $EM A iff M F= o (-,A

:J

<>..,B).

Figure 2 shows a CO-model where A, B, ..,B and C are
each more plausible than -,A. Every world where -,A holds
is strictly less plausible than some world where these other
propositions hold. We also see that A 1\ -,c is more plau­
sible than -,A 1\ C. A and C are equally (and maximally)
plausible, yet A is more entrenched than C. This is due
to the fact that as we "move up" from the bottom cluster,
we find a -,c�world before a -.A-world. -.Cis more read­
ily "accepted" than -,A, so Cis less entrenched. Notice,
since there are no worlds satisfying (say) -,A 1\ -,B in the
model, we judge all such worlds to have no plausibility,
1r ( w) = 0. Correspondingly, according to our definition of
$pM, -.A 1\ -.B is (strictly) less plausible than any sen­
tence satisfied in the model. Furthermore, every sentence
in the language is at least as plausible as -.A 1\ -,B. That
is, o '5:PM -.A 1\ -.B for all a (including a = J.). Thus,
we see that II( -.A 1\ -.B) = 0. As mentioned above, one
should think of the R-minimal worlds in a model (those with
maximal plausibility) as representing the epistemic state of
the agent in question. In other words, each minimal world
is epistemically possible. In this example, we consider the
two lowest worlds to be those consistent with the agent's
beliefs, while all other worlds violate some belief. Here,
the agent believes A 1\ C. In the next section we will see
how belief can be expressed at the object level.
We can show two key results concerning this model of
qualitative possibility.
Theorem 3 Any entrenchment ordering determined by a

CO-model M is a qualitative necessity ordering satisfying
postulates (Nl) through (N6).

Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility and Beliefs

Theorem 4 For any qualitative necessity orrkring �

,.

there is a CO-model M detennining the corresponding en­
trenchment orrlering: A �EM B iff A� N B.
These results show that necessity orderings and entre nch­
ment orderings determined by CO are exactly the same.
It inunediately follows th at the space of plausibil ity order­
ings determined by CO-models corresponds precisely to the
set of qualitative possibility orderings. The first theorem

easy to verify using the de finiti on of A 5EM B and
the l og ic al properties of CO. The second theorem can be
shown as foll ows: we consider the corresponding qualita­
ti v e p ossibil ity measure� .. and c onstrUct a CO-model that
determines the plausibility ordering (it is easy to see that
the dual entrenchment and necessity orderings will then be
equivalent as well). We can constrUct a CO-model M u s­
ing as w orl ds the maximal consistent sets of LcPL (which
determine the obvious valuations). We define cuts on the
language as any set C � LcPL such that if A E C and
A �.. B then B E C (see Grove (1988), who uses thi s
technique). We exclude from M all worlds that intersect
only the minimal cut. {A : l. � ... A}, and define accessi­
bility as follows:
is

wRv iff every cut C that intersects v also inter­
sects w (i.e., v n C :f: 0 implies w n C :f: 0).
It is easy to verify that M is a CO-model. We can also
show that M F Ei(B :::> OA) iff A �.. B. We sketch this
briefly, assuming B >,. J... Let w be a world containing B
and C be the "smallest" cut that intersects w. If A � .. B
the properties of� .. ensure that: a) if A is consistent witb
the negation of all sentences inC then there is a maximal
consi stent set v containing A disjoint from C; b) if A is
inc on sistent with tbis set it is easy to verify that A Is in C
but that A is in no smaller cut than C. In either case wRv
fo r s ome A -world v an d M F D(B :::> <>A) .The converse
is quite clear.

As discussed by Dubois (1986), for finitary lang uages a
qualitative possibility measure is compatible with a map­
ping of sentences into the interval [0, 1] iff the mapping
is a possibility measure (compatibility means A �.. B iff
IT(A) � II(B)). Hence, plausibility orderi ngs in CO are
precise qualitative counterparts of possibil ity measures, and
entrenchment orderings corresp on d to necessity measures.
Our treatment of plausibility and entrenchment generalizes
that of Dubois and Prade by permitting orderings on infinite
languages (with CO-models serving as adequate represen­
tation structures).

Beliefs and Conditionals
Beliefs

We have seen how to express qualitative possibility and
necessity measures using two modal operators. More im­
portantly, the relationship to CO allows us to exhibit con­
nections between possibility theory and other forms of de­
feasible reasoning. We begin by explaining the choice of

terminology of the last section. The ordering 5EM deter­
mined by some CO-model turns out to be an expectation
orrkring in the sense o f Gllrdenfors and Makinson (1991 ).
These themselves are weakenings of orderings of eplstemic
entrenchment (GIIrdenfors 1988), which are intended to rep­
resent the degree of certainty of elements of a beli ef set K.
For any (deductively cl osed) belief set K an entrenchmen t
ordering 5E (A 5E B means B is at least as e ntrench ed

as A) satisfies the postulates
(El) If A 5E B and B 5E

C then A 5E C

(El) If A 1- B then A 5E B

(E3) If A, B E K then A 5E A f\ B or B 5E A 1\ B
(E4) If K :f:. Cn(l.) then A fl. K iff A 5E B for all B
(ES) If B 5E A for all B then 1- A
Dubois and Prade (1991b) show a partial correspondence
between qualitative necessity and entrenchment. For any
necessity ordering� N. they define the set of beliefs associated with� N to be
K

={a: a> N J..}

Assuming that N(J..) = 0 for any necessity measure used
to "generate.. the necessity ordering, this mean s N(a) > 0.
Thus, a is believed just when it has some degree of nece s­
sity. Entrenchment and qualitative necessity correspond i f
we ignore (N4) and (E5). Entrenchmen t fails to satisfy (N4)
only when every sentence is equally entrenched ( in cluding
J..); that is, when we are dealing with the inconsistent belief
set. We will ignore this case and assume that entrenchment
orderings are nontrivial, satisfying (N4).7

fails to satisfy (E5) because certain
nontautologous beliefs are allowed to be certain or com­
pletely necessary (i.e N(a) = 1). In general, en trench ­
ment orderings determined by CO-models will not satisfy
(E5). But if we consider only CO*-models, every logi­
cally consistent a has some degree of possibility, and every
contingent sentence will be less cenain than T. Thus (E5)
is satisfied by the full qualitative necessity ordering deter­
mined by any CO*-model.

Qualitative necessity

Theorem S (Boutilier 1992b) Any entrenchment orrkring
determined l7y a CO*-model satisfies

(El)- (E5).

Theorem 6 (Boutilier 1992b) For any entrenchment or·
dering 5E there is a CO*-model M detennining the corre­
sponding entrenchment ordering: A 5EM B iff A 5E B.
Of course, the real reason for examining logics of qualitative
necessity and possibility is to provide a method of express·

ing and reasoning with qualitative constraints o n necessity
and possibility (i.e., premises) without relying on complete
knowledge of, say, a possibility ordering or measure. Given
certain constraints we can determine through logical deduc­
tion wh at must be trUe in all measures or orderings sati s fying

these constraints. The expressive power of CO and CO*
can also be used to capture notions that are not amenable
to direct analysis using a simple language of qualitative
necessity or possibility (e.g., Farinas and Herzig's QPL).
Naturally, we'd like to express relationships of qualitative
possibility. In QPL one may assert A �. B, while in CO

we say

D(B ::> <>A) to indicate that A is as possible as B.

Absolute concepts such as belief, disbelief, possibility and
necessity are important as well. These can also be asserted
in QPL; for example, '"'A is believed" is just T > •
CO, these modalities can be expressed as follows:
•

..,A.

In

a is believed it must have some degree of neces­
(N(a) > 0). In CO this is expressible as ODa.

When
sity

This is true exactly when there is some point is the
model where a holds at all more plausible worlds. In

particular, such a point exists when a holds at the most
possible worlds (assuming such a limit). We define
a modality for belief in this way, Ba denoting ooa.
The model in Figure 2 satisfies BA and BG. It is
easy to verify that CO satisfies the axioms of the belief
logic weak S5 when B is taken as a modal operator.
Thus, qualitative possibility respects some reasonable
conditions on the beliefs it determines. Some of the
more notable properties are the introspective axioms,
which are valid in CO:

Ba :> BBa

and

..,sa :> 8-,Ba

then a is believed; if KB � a then a is not believed. In
the usual epistemic logics, merely asserting B(KB) does

not carry this force. Indeed, B(KB ) does not preclude the
possibility ofBa when KBU{a} is consistent, even if KB �
a. To express that the sentences in KB are believed in QPL,
we need only assert that T >. KB (or that N(KB) > 0
in a quantitative setting). But there are no convenient and
systematic means of asserting that these are the only beliefs,
or that these are the only sentences that have some positive
degree of necessity.

In CO, we can express the fact that KB is all that is believed
using the sentence
O(KB) =de D(KB ::> (DKB A D-.KB))
Typically, we consider only CO*-models when discussing
"all that is known," for this terminology suggests that no

logical possibilities should be excluded from consideration.
When KB is believed, only KB-worlds can be accepted as

epistemically possible. When KB is all that is believed, not

only should KB be believed, but every KB-world should be
accepted as epistemically possible. If some world is not
accepted, then there should be some belief that excludes
this world from consideration, some belief falsified by that
world. If a world satisfies KB, there is no such belief when
KB is all that is believed.
For purely propositional KB we have that

a and 8-.a are not.

•

Disbeliefis expressed as -.Ba. This is true just when
N(a) = 0, or 11(-,a) = 1. Notice that -.Ba and
...,a...,a are mutually consistent. The model in Figure 2
satisfies -.BB and -.8-.B.

•

a has some degree of possibility (11(-.a) > 0),
..,a cannot be certain. This holds exactly when Oa is
verified (a is true at some world with a nonzero degree
If

of possibility).
•

Finally, a is completely necessary (N(a)

=

1) exactly

when Da holds. The model inFigure 2 satisfies D(Av
B) since A VB holds at each world (it is completely

necessary) ..,A 1\ -.B is accorded no possibility at all.
Some degree of necessity is assigned to a (N(a) > 0)
just when it is believed; that is, Ba is true. So, in
•

the example, B and -.B have a necessity measure of
zero (since neither is believed). A and Care accorded
some (less than absolute) degree of necessity, with A
being more necessary (or entrenched) than C.

CO and CO* are much stronger than this. In particular, these
logics allow us to express the concept of only knowing. To
only know (or only believe) a sentence a is to believe a
and to believe nothing more than is required by a (Levesque
1990). For example, given a (finite) knowled e base KB,
we usually intend that KB is all that is believed. If KB f= a

f

8

We will often use KB as if it were the conjunction of its
elements (a sentence). For a fuller discussion of only knowing see
(Levesque 1990; Boutilier 1992b).

F=co. Ba
f=co. -.Ba

O(KB)

Notice that Ba and 8-.a are mutually inconsistent, but

O(KB)

iff KB
iff KB

f= a
�a

(see (Boutilier 1992b) for details). In particular, the only
sentences assigned a degree of necessity greater than 0 are
those entailed by KB. In a natural and convenient fash­
ion we can summarize what would require an infinite set
of sentences in QPL, (or an unwieldy number for finite

languages). The model in Figure 2 satisfies O (A 1\ C),
assuming a language with only three atoms (and ignoring
the fact that this is not a CO*-model). Thus, O(A 1\ C) is
a concise way of expressing that only the consequences of
A 1\ C are assigned a positive degree of necessity. Again,
this is crucial since, when one specifies some knowledge
base KB, it is usually intended that only those sentences
derivable from KB are believed.

The expressive power of CO goes beyond this, however.
Nothing prevents the occurrence of nonpropositional sen­
tences in KB. We can have belief sentences in KB, and even
sentences of an autoepistemic nature. In fact, in (Boutilier

1992b) we show that co• subsumes autoepistemic logic.
So we can think of co• as adding to qualitative possi­
bility logic the ability to express autoepistemic reasoning.
With this connection, of course, degrees of possibility or
entrenchment can be interpreted as generalizing autoepis­
temic logic as well.

3.2

Conditionals

CO has been used as a conditional logic for representing
default rules. In (Boutilier 1990; Boutilier 1991) we define a
conditional connective=>. reading

A => B as "A normally

Modal Logics for Qualitative Possib i lity and Beliefs

implies B." We can show that co•, used in this way,
captures Lehmann's (1989) rational consequence relations
and Pearl's (1988) €-semantics. This connective can be
related to our plausibility orderings as follows:

Theorem 7 Let M be a CO-model. Then M I=
A 1\ B <PM A 1\

-,B or M

I=

A�

B iff

0-,A.

In other words, A � B holds just when A A B is more
possible than A A ...,B (or A is impossible, II(A) = 0).
With a little simplification of these conditions, we obtain
the definition of the connective� as presented by Boutilier
(1990; 1991)
A� B =dr

0-,A V O(A 1\ D(A

::> B))

Thus we can define an inferential relation on conditional
sentences (or default rules) using qualitative possibility,
and it will be equivalent to a number of other systems of
defeasible inference. These include the following systems
(whose relationship to CO is explored in the corresponding
references): Pearl's (1988) €-semantics (Boutilier 1992d;
Boutilier 1990); Lehmann's (1989) preferential and ratio­
nal consequence relations (Boutilier 1990); the purely con­
ditional fragment of Lewis's (1973) counterfactual logic
VC (Boutilier 1992c). As discussed above, Gru-denfors and
Makinson's (1991) notion of expectation inference, based
on their expectation orderings, also corresponds to this sort
of conditional possibilistic inference (ignoring the trivial
expectation ordering), a connection they point out. We
note that most of these equivalences rely on our specifi­
cation of qualitative necessity and possibility in terms of
nonfinite languages.

Example Let A,S, E stand for "adult", "grad student" and
"employed", respectively, and consider the following
set of premises (a standard example from the default
reasoning literature):

{ A�

E,S� AS
, � -,E}

Our conditionals are exception-allowing since A A -,E
is consistent with this theory. Preference for more
specific defaults is automatically incorporated into the
definition of � as well. From this theory we can
deriveS 1\ A � -,E using consequence in CO, but
we cannot derive S 1\ A => E. Also derivable are
constraints on permissible possibility assignments, for
example, it must be that A >,.S. It is more plausible
that someone is simply an adult than a grad student.
The relationship with €-semantics holds particular interest
since its semantic foundations rely on probabilistic notions.
By presenting qualitative possibility andc-semantics within
our modal framework we can show the following equiva­

This follows from the results of(Boutilier 1990) and (Kraus,
Lehmann and Magidor 1990), but a direct proof of this result
is given in (Boutilier 1992a).
This connection has also been examined by Dubois and
Prade (199la). Using CO as the intermediate framework
between s-semantics and qualitative possibility allows us
to see the underlying semantic commonality in these sys­
tems. Adams's (1975) construction for determining the
consistency of theories of statements about arbitrarily high
probabilities can be interpreted as ranking possible worlds
according to their degree of probability. Given this ranking,
it is easy to ensure that the conditional probabilities of the
statements in the theory are as high as they need to be. But
this ranking can also be construed as a simple CO-model.
Our interpretation of CO-models in this paper equates this
ranking with the degree of possibility of worlds. On ei­
ther interpretation of the models, the same conclusions are
derivable from simple conditional theories.
The results of Boutilier (1990) also show that €-semantics

can be modeled in the monomodal logic S4.9 Thus for
the purely conditional fragment of qualitative possibility
theories, representation and inference can be performed
using S4 (and conversel , if S4 is restricted to its simple
"conditional" fragment). 0

(;

Once we allow boolean combinations of conditionals, it is
not clear that the intuitions underlying Adams's approach
remain viable. Our semantics for qualitative possibility is
more compelling in this case. We must also contrast our
approach with the model of conditional possibility adopted
by Dubois and Prade (1991a). They provide a semantics
for (some) boolean combinations of conditionals defined in
terms of possibility measures. Unfortunately, they equate
the ''weak negation" of a conditional-, ( A� B) with the

"strong negation" A � -,B. This is certainly not the
case on our definition of conditionals. Merely denying
a conditional is not reason to accept that the antecedent
justifies acceptance of the negation of the consequent. It

should be quite reasonable to say "My door is not (normally)
open or closed." In CO, the following is consistent:

-,(A=> B) A -,(A=> ..,B).
Our extension of the conditional language is much more
compelling in this respect.

Concluding Remarks

We have presented two modal logics for reasoning about
orderings of qualitative necessity and possibility. The ex­
pressive power of CO and co• can be used to express
constraints on possibility measures in a natural and concise

lence. We assume a __... {3 is some abstract conditional,
being interpreted either as => in CO or as a default rule in
the sense of €-semantics (we assume a is satisfiable).

10We note that S4 structures are precisely CO-models without
the requirement of connectedness. While this relaxation is not
appropriate in general, simple conditional theories cannot express

the distinction between the two types of structures. Thus the
simple fragment of the (mono-) modal logic S4.3 (characterized
by the class of connected, or CO, models) is also equivalent to
these logics. See (Boutilier 1990) for details.

fashion (for example, through only knowing). As pointed
out by a number of people, the numbers attached to proposi­
tions by possibility measures are perhaps ofless importance
than the ranking of the propositions. We are able to exploit
this fact in developing a simple semantic account of qual­
itative possibility. This simple view allows us to exhibit
the connection between possibility theory and a number of
other forms of defeasible reasoning. Furthermore, these
modal possibilistic logics provide a means of representing
very general constraints on possibility measures, since we
allow arbitrary boolean combinations of formulae.
A number of avenues remain to be explored. By generaliz­
ing the logic CO. we can explore weaker types ofpossibilis­
tic semantics. For example, by dropping the requirement
of connectedness (obtaining the logic CT40 of (Boutilier
1 992a)) we are in essence modeling partially ordered pos­
sibilistic measure sets. Though we have demonstrated or
pointed to a number of connections to existing systems of
defeasible reasoning, some of these remain to be explored
in detail . A number of other interesting relationships are
brought to light by this work as well. Possibilistic logic has
strong ties to Shafer's belief functions (Dubois and Prade
1 99 1b). This suggests a link to the forms of defeasible
reasoning discussed in the last section, a connection we
have yet to explore. We have also begun preliminary in­
vestigations into the relationship between our conditional
approaches to default reasoning based on CO* and proba­
bilistic systems of reasoning such as that of Bacchus (1 990),
which could possibly bring to light further connections to
possibilistic logic.
