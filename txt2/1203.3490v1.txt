whereas all DEC-POMDP algorithms explicitly store
the policy as a mapping from observation sequences
to actions, making them unsuitable for the infinitehorizon case. In POMDPs, the Bellman equation
forms the basis of most point-based solvers, but as
Bernstein et. al. [4] highlight, no analogous equation
exists for DEC-POMDPs.
To alleviate such problems, most infinite-horizon algorithms represent agent policies as finite-state controllers [1, 4]. So far, only two algorithms have
shown promise for effectively solving infinite-horizon
DEC-POMDPs–decentralized bounded policy iteration (DEC-BPI) [4] and a non-linear programming
based approach (NLP) [1]. However, both of these
algorithms have significant drawbacks in terms of the
representative class of problems that can be handled.
For example, solving DEC-POMDPs with continuous
state or action spaces is not supported by either of
these approaches. Scaling up to structured representations such as factored or hierarchical state-space is
difficult due to convergence issues in DEC-BPI and
a potential increase in the number of non-linear constraints in the NLP solver. Further, none of the above
approaches have been shown to work for more than
2 agents, a significant bottleneck for solving practical
problems.
To address these shortcomings, we present a promising new class of algorithms which amalgamates planning with probabilistic inference and opens the door

to the application of rich inference techniques to solving infinite-horizon DEC-POMDPs. Our technique is
based on Toussaint et. al.’s approach of transforming the planning problem to its equivalent mixture
of dynamic Bayes nets (DBNs) and using likelihood
maximization in this framework to optimize the policy
value [20, 19]. Earlier work on planning by probabilistic inference can be found in [2]. Such approaches have
been successful in solving MDPs and POMDPs [19].
They also easily extend to factored or hierarchical
structures [18] and can handle continuous action and
state spaces thanks to advanced probabilistic inference
techniques [10]. We show how DEC-POMDPs, which
are much harder to solve than MDPs or POMDPs,
can also be reformulated as a mixture of DBNs. We
then present the Expectation Maximization algorithm
(EM) to maximize the reward likelihood in this framework. The EM algorithm naturally has the desirable
anytime property as it is guaranteed to improve the
likelihood (and hence the policy value) with each iteration. We also discuss its extension to large multiagent systems. Our experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the
state-of-the-art algorithms, DEC-BPI and NLP-based
optimization. It always produces better quality policies than DEC-BPI and for some instances, it nearly
doubles the solution quality of the NLP solver. Finally, we discuss potential pitfalls, which are inherent
in the EM based approach.

This added uncertainty about other agents in the system make DEC-POMDPs NEXP complete [5].
We are concerned with solving infinite-horizon DECPOMDPs with a discount factor γ. We represent
the stationary policy of each agent using a fixed
size, stochastic finite-state controller (FSC) similar to [1]. An FSC can be described by a tuple
hN, π, λ, νi. N denotes a finite set of controller nodes
n; π : N → ∆A represents the actions selection model
or the probability πan = P (a|n); λ : N × Y → ∆N
represents the node transition model or the probability λn0 ny = P (n0 |n, y); ν : N → ∆N represents
the initial node distribution νn = P (n). We adopt
the convention that nodes of agent 1’s controller are
denoted by p and agent 2’s by q. Other problem
parameters such as observation function P (y, z|s, a, b)
are represented using subscripts as Pyzsab . The value
for starting the controllers in nodes hp, qi at state s is
given by:

The DEC-POMDP model

In this section, we introduce the DEC-POMDP model
for two agents [5]. Note that finite-horizon DECPOMDPs are NEXP complete even for two agents.
The set S denotes the set of environment states, with
a given initial state distribution b0 . The action set
of agent 1 is denoted by A and agent 2 by B. The
state transition probability P (s0 |s, a, b) depends upon
the actions of both the agents. Upon taking the joint
action ha, bi in state s, agents receive the joint reward
R(s, a, b). Y is the finite set of observations for agent 1
and Z for agent 2. O(s, ab, yz) denotes the probability
P (y, z|s, a, b) of agent 1 observing y ∈ Y and agent 2
observing z ∈ Z when the joint action ha, bi was taken
and resulted in state s.
To highlight the differences between a single agent
POMDP and a DEC-POMDP, we note that in a
POMDP an agent can maintain a belief over the environment state. However, in a DEC-POMDP, an agent
is not only uncertain about the environment states but
also about the actions and observations of the other
agent. Therefore in a DEC-POMDP a belief over the
states cannot be maintained during execution time.

DEC-POMDPs as mixture of DBNs

In this section, we describe how DEC-POMDPs can
be reformulated as a mixture of DBNs such that maximizing the reward likelihood (to be defined later) in
this framework is equivalent to optimizing the joint
policy. Our approach is based on the framework proposed in [19, 20] to solve Markovian planning problems
using probabilistic inference. First we informally describe the intuition behind this reformulation (for details please refer to [19]) and then we describe in detail
the steps specific to DEC-POMDPs.
A DEC-POMDP can be described using a single DBN
where the reward is emitted at each time step. However, in our approach, it is described by an infinite
mixture of a special type of DBNs where reward is
emitted only at the end. For example, Fig. 1(a) describes the DBN for time t = 0. The key intuition
is that for the reward emitted at any time step T ,
we have a separate DBN with the general structure
as in Fig. 1(b). Further, to simulate the discounting of rewards, probability of time variable
T is set as
P∞
P (T = t) = γ t (1 − γ). This ensures that t=0 pt = 1.
In addition, the random variable r shown in Fig. 1(a,b)

is a binary variable with its conditional distribution
(for any time T ) described using the normalized immediate reward as R̂sab = P (r = 1|sT = s, aT = a, bT =
b) = (Rsab − Rmin )/(Rmax − Rmin ). This scaling of
the reward is the key to transforming the optimization
problem from the realm of planning to likelihood maximization as stated below. θ denotes the parameters
hπ, λ, νi for each agent’s controller.
Theorem 1. Let the1 CPT of binary rewards r be such
that R̂sab ∝ Rsab and the discounting time
prior be set
1
as P (T ) = γ T (1 − γ). Then, maximizing the likelihood
Lθ = P (r = 1; θ) in the mixture of DBNs is equivalent
to optimizing the DEC-POMDP policy. Furthermore,
the joint-policy value relates linearly P
to the likelihood
as V θ = (Rmax − Rmin )Lθ /(1 − γ) + T γ T Rmin
The proof is omitted as it is very similar to that of
MDPs and POMDPs [19]. Before detailing the EM algorithm, we describe the DBN representation of DECPOMDPs–the basis for any inference technique.
The DBN for any time step T is shown in Fig. 1(b).
Every node is a random variable with subscripts indicating time. pi denotes controller nodes for agent 1
and qi for agent 2. The remaining nodes represent the
states, actions, and observations. There are four kinds
of dependencies induced by the DEC-POMDP model
that the DBN must represent:
• State transitions: State transitions as a result
of the joint action of both agents and the previous
state, shown by the DBN’s middle layer.
• Controller node transitions (λ): These transitions depend on the last controller state and the
most recent individual observation received. They
are shown in the top and bottom layers.
• Action probabilities (π): The action taken at
any time step t depends on the current controller
state. The links between controller nodes (pi or qi )
and action nodes (ai or bi ) model this.
• Observation probabilities: First, the probability of receiving joint observation yi zi depends on
the joint action of both agents and the domain

state. This relationship is modeled by the DBN
nodes labeled yi zi . Second, the individual observation each agent receives is a deterministic function of the joint observation. That is Pyy0 z0 =
P (y|y 0 z 0 ) = 1 if y = y 0 else 0. This is modeled
by a link between yi zi and the nodes yi and zi .
To highlight the differences from a POMDP, Fig. 1(c)
shows the DBN for a POMDP. The sheer scale of interactions present in a DEC-POMDP DBN become clear
1
from this comparison, also highlighting
the difficulty
of solving DEC-POMDPs even approximately. In a
POMDP, an agent receives the observation which is
affected by the environment state, whereas in a DECPOMDP agents only perceive the individual part of
the joint observation yi zi . Such differences in the interaction structure make the E and M steps of a DECPOMDP EM very different from that of a POMDP,
despite sharing the same high-level principles.

EM algorithm for DEC-POMDPs

This section describes the EM algorithm [7] for maximizing the reward likelihood in the mixture of DBNs
representing DEC-POMDPs. In the corresponding
DBNs, only the binary reward is treated as observed
(r = 1); all other variables are latent. While maximizing the likelihood, EM yields the DEC-POMDP
joint-policy parameters θ. EM also possesses the desirable anytime characteristic as the likelihood (and the
policy value which is proportional to the likelihood) is
guaranteed to increase per iteration until convergence.
We note that EM is not guaranteed to converge to
the global optima. However, in the experiments we
show that EM almost always achieves similar values
as the state-of-the-art NLP based solver [1] and much
better than DEC-BPI [4]. The main advantage of using EM lies in its ability to easily generalize to much
richer representations than currently possible for DECPOMDPs such as factored or hierarchical controllers,
continuous state and action spaces. Another important advantage is the ability to generalize the solver to
larger multi-agent systems with more than 2 agents.

The E step we derive next is generic as any probabilistic inference technique can be used.
4.1

E-step

p,q,s

In the E-step, for the fixed parameter θ, forward messages α and backward messages β are propagated.
First, we define the following Markovian transitions on
the (p, q, s) state in the DBN of Fig. 1(b). These transitions are independent of the time t due to the stationary joint policy. We also adopt the convention that for
any random variable v, v 0 refers to the next time slice
and v̄ refers to the previous time slice. For any group
of variables v, Pt (v, v0 ) refers to P (vt = v, vt+1 = v0 ).

p,q,s

Intuitively, α messages compute the probability of visiting a particular (p, q, s) state in the DBN as per the
current policy. The β messages are similar to computing the value of starting the controllers in nodes hp, qi
at state s using dynamic programming. They are propagated backwards and are defined as Pt (r = 1|p, q, s).
However, this particular definition would require separate inference for each DBN as for T and T 0 step
DBN, βt will be different due to difference in the
time-to-go (T − t and T 0 − t). To circumvent this
problem, β messages are indexed backward in time as
βτ (p, q, s) = PT −τ (r = 1|p, q, s) using the index τ such
that τ = 0 denotes the time slice t = T . Hence we get:

β0 (p, q, s) =
Rsab πap πbq

βτ (p, q, s)

If both α and
β messages are propagated for k steps

and Lθ2k  T =0 γ T LθT , then the message propagation can be stopped.

Based on the α and β messages

more quantities α̂(p, q, s) = t P (T = t)α(p, q, s) and
P
β̂(p, q, s) = t P (T = t)β(p, q, s), which will be used
in the M-step. The cut-off time for message propagation can either be fixed a priori or be more flexible
based on the likelihood accumulation. If α messages

Calculating the Markov transitions on the (p, q, s)
chain has complexity O(N 4 S 2 A2 Y 2 ), where N is the
maximum number of nodes for a controller. The
message propagation has complexity O(Tmax N 4 S 2 ).
Techniques to effectively reduce this complexity without sacrificing accuracy will be discussed later.
4.2

αt is defined as Pt (p, q, s; θ). It might appear that
we need to propagate α messages for each DBN separately, but as pointed out in [19], only one sweep is
required as the head of the DBN is shared among all
the mixture components. That is, α2 is the same for
all the T-step DBNs with T ≥ 2. We will omit using
θ as long as it is unambiguous.

then the likelihood for T = t + τ is given by

Lθt+τ = P (r = 1|T = t + τ ; θ) =
αt (p, q, s)βτ (p, q, s)

M-step

In the DBNs of Fig. 1(a,b) every variable is hidden except the reward variable. After each M-step, EM provides better estimates of these variables, improving the
likelihood Lθ and hence the policy value. For details
of EM, we refer to [7]. The parameters to estimate are
hπ, λ, νi for each agent. For a particular DBN for time
T , let L̃ = (P, Q, A, B, S) denote the latent variables,
where each variable denotes a sequence of length T .
That is, P = p0:T . EM maximizes the following expected complete log-likelihood for the DEC-POMDP
DBN mixture. θ denotes the previous parameters and
θ? denotes new parameters.

Complexity and implementation issues

The complexity of updating all action parameters is
O(N 4 S 2 AY 2 ). Updating node transitions requires
O(N 4 S 2 Y 2 + N 2 S 2 Y 2 A2 ). This is relatively high
when compared to the POMDP updates requiring
O(N 2 S 2 AY ) mainly due to the scale of the interactions present in DEC-POMDPs.
In our experimental settings, we observed that having a relatively small sized controller (N ≤ 5) suffices to yield good quality solutions. The main contributor to the complexity is the factor S 2 as we
experimented with large domains having nearly 250
states. The good news is that the structure of the
E and M-step equations provides a way to effectively
reduce this complexity by significant factor without
sacrificing accuracy. For a given state s, joint action
ha, bi and joint observation hy, zi, the possible next
states can be calculated as follows: succ(s, a, b, y, z) =
{s0 |P (s0 |s, a, b)P (y, z|s0 , a, b) > 0}. For most of the
problems, the size of this set is typically a constant
k < 10. Such simple reachability analysis and other
techniques could speed up the EM algorithm by more
than an order of magnitude for large problems. The
effective complexity reduces to O(N 4 SAY 2 k) for the
action updates and O(N 4 SY 2 k+N 2 SY 2 A2 k) for node
transitions. Other enhancements of the EM implementation are discussed in Section 6.

Experiments

We experimented with several standard 2-agent DECPOMDP benchmarks with discount factor 0.9. Complete details of these problems can be found in [1, 4].

We compare our approach with the decentralized
bounded policy iteration (DEC-BPI) algorithm [4] and
a non-convex optimization solver (NLP) [1]. The
DEC-BPI algorithm iteratively improves the parameters of a node using a linear program while keeping
the other nodes’ parameters fixed. The NLP approach
recasts the policy optimization problem as a non-linear
program and uses an off-the-shelf solver, Snopt [9], to
obtain a solution. We implemented the EM algorithm
in JAVA. All our experiments were on a Mac with
4GB RAM and 2.4GHz CPU. Each data point is an
average of 10 runs with random initial controller parameters. In terms of solution quality, EM is always
better than DEC-BPI and it achieves similar or higher
solution quality than NLP. We note that our current
implementation is mainly a proof-of-concept; we have
not yet implemented several enhancements (discussed
later) that could improve the performance of the EM
approach. In contrast, the NLP solver [9] is an optimized package and therefore for larger problems is
currently faster than the EM approach. The fact that
a crude implementation of the EM approach works so
well is very encouraging.
Table 1 shows results for the broadcast channel problem, which has 4 states, 2 actions per agent and 5 observations. This is a networking problem where agents
must decide whether or not to send a message on a
shared channel and must avoid collision to get a reward. We tested with different controller sizes. On
this problem, all the algorithms compare reasonably
well, with EM being better than DEC-BPI and very
close in value to NLP. The time for NLP is also ≈ 1s.
Fig. 2(a) compares the solution quality of the EM approach against DEC-BPI and NLP for varying controller sizes on the recycling robots problem. In this
problem, two robots have the task of picking up cans
in an office building. They can search for a small can, a
big can or recharge the battery. The large item is only
retrievable by the joint action of the two robots. Their
goal is to coordinate their actions to maximize the joint
reward. EM(2) and NLP(2) show the results with controller size 2 for both agents in Fig. 2(a). For this
problem, EM works much better than both DEC-BPI
and the NLP approach. EM achieves a value of ≈ 62
for all controller sizes, providing nearly 12% improvement over DEC-BPI (= 55) and 20% improvement
over NLP (= 51). Fig. 2(b) shows the time comparisons for EM with different controller sizes. Both the
NLP and DEC-BPI take nearly 1s to converge. EM

Figure 2: Solution quality and runtime for recycling robots (a) & (b) and meeting on a grid (c) & (d)

with controller size 2 has comparable performance, but
as expected, EM with 4-node controllers takes longer
as the complexity of EM is proportional to O(N 4 ).
Fig. 2(c) compares the solution quality of EM on the
meeting on a grid problem. In this problem, agents
start diagonally across in a 2 × 2 grid and their goal
is to take actions such that they meet each other (i.e.,
share the same square) as much as possible. As the figure shows, EM provides much better solution quality
than the NLP approach. EM achieves a value of ≈ 7,
which nearly doubles the solution quality achieved by
NLP (= 3.3). DEC-BPI results are not plotted as it
performs much worse and achieves a solution quality of
0, essentially unable to improve the policy at all even
for large controllers. Both DEC-BPI and NLP take
around 1s to converge. Fig. 2(d) shows the time comparison for EM versions. EM with 2-node controllers
is very fast and takes < 1s to converge (50 iterations).
Also note that in both the cases, EM could run with
much larger controller sizes (≈ 10), but the increase in
size did not provide tangible improvement in solution
quality.
Fig. 3 shows the results for the multi-agent tiger problem, involving two doors with a tiger behind one door
and a treasure behind the other. Agents should coordinate to open the door leading to the treasure [1].
Fig. 3(a) shows the quality comparisons. EM does
not perform well in this case; even after increasing the
controller size, it achieves a value of −19. NLP works
better with large controller sizes. However, this experiment presents an interesting insight into the workings
of EM as related to the scaling of the rewards. Recalling the relation between the likelihood and the policy
value from Theorem 1, the equation for this problem

Figure 3: Solution quality (a) and likelihood (b) for “tiger”

is: V θ = 1210Lθ − 1004.5. For EM to achieve the
same solution as the best NLP setting (= −3), the
likelihood should be .827. Fig. 3(b) shows that the
likelihood EM converges to is .813. Therefore, from
EM’s perspective, it is finding a really good solution.
Thus, the scaling of rewards has a significant impact
(in this case, adverse) on the policy value. This is a
potential drawback of the EM approach, which applies
to other Markovian planning problems too when using
the technique of [19]. Incidently, DEC-BPI performs
much worse on this problem and gets a quality of −77.
Fig. 4 shows the results for the two largest DECPOMDP domains–box pushing and Mars rovers. In
the box pushing domain, agents need to coordinate
and push boxes into a goal area. In the Mars rovers
domain, agents need to coordinate their actions to perform experiments at multiple sites. Fig. 4(a) shows
that EM performs much better than DEC-BPI for every controller size. For controller size 2, EM achieves
better quality than NLP with comparable runtime
(Fig. 4(b), 500 iterations). However, for the larger controller size (= 3), it achieves slightly lower quality than
NLP. For the largest Mars rovers domain (Fig. 4(c)),
EM achieves better solution quality (= 9.9) than NLP
(= 8.1). However, EM also takes many more iterations
to converge than for previous problems and hence, requires more time than NLP. EM is also much better
than DEC-BPI, which achieves a quality of −1.18 and
takes even longer to converge (Fig. 4(d)).

Conclusion and future work

We present a new approach to solve DEC-POMDPs
using inference in a mixture of DBNs. Even a simple
implementation of the approach provides good results.
Extensive experiments show that EM is always better
than DEC-BPI and compares favorably with the stateof-the-art NLP solver. The experiments also highlight
two potential drawbacks of the EM approach: the adverse effect of reward scaling on solution quality and
slow convergence rate for large problems. We are currently addressing the runtime issue by parallelizing the
algorithm. For example, α and β can be propagated
in parallel. Even updating each node’s parameters can

be done in parallel for each iteration. Furthermore, the
structure of EM’s update equations is very amenable
to Google’s Map-Reduce paradigm [6], allowing each
parameter to be computed by a cluster of machines in
parallel using Map-Reduce. Such scalable techniques
will certainly make our approach many times faster
than the current serial implementation. We are also
investigating how a different scaling of rewards affects
the convergence properties of EM.
The main benefit of the EM approach is that it opens
up the possibility of using powerful probabilistic inference techniques to solve decentralized planning problems. Using a graphical DBN structure, EM can easily
generalize to richer representations such as factored or
hierarchical controllers, or continuous state and action
spaces. Unlike the existing techniques, EM can easily
extend to larger multi-agent systems with more than 2
agents. The ND-POMDP model [13] is a class of DECPOMDPs specifically designed to support large multiagent systems. It makes some restrictive yet realistic assumptions such as locality of interaction among
agents, and transition and observation independence.
EM can naturally exploit such independence structure
in the DBN and scale to larger multi-agent systems,
something that current infinite-horizon algorithms fail
to achieve. Hence the approach we introduce offers
great promise to overcome the shortcomings of the prevailing approaches to multi-agent planning.
