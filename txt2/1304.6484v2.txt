higher-dimensional LV operators should also be considered, and several studies involving
dimension-five LV operators have been carried out [12–16].
In this paper, assuming a fixed vector background v µ to be the only source that induces
the breaking of Lorentz symmetry, we shall consider the spinor electrodynamics modified

3
by some dimension-five LV interactions between fermions and photons. Higher-dimensional
interactions are best classified in terms of derivative expansion. Dimension-five interactions
are quadratic in gauge covariant derivative Dµ , which is given by Dµ = ∂ µ + iAµ . Recall
that [Dµ , Dν ] = iF µν , where F µν is the electromagnetic tensor. If we restrict ourself to
consider only terms linear in the vector background v µ and the photon field Aµ , then the
most general dimension-five interactions are of the form
Lv = v µ ΨKµναβ γ ν ΨF αβ
where Kµναβ =

(1)

(a1 + b1 γ 5 ) µναβ + (a2 + b2 γ 5 ) gµα gνβ with ai and bi being dimensionless

constants. The factor 1/2 in Kµναβ is introduced for later convenience. One can easily see
that the mass dimension of the background vector v µ is [v µ ] = −1. Note that each term in (1)
violates CP T . While ai terms preserve C parity (and thus violate P T ), bi terms violated
it (and thus preserve P T ). Constraints from the electric dipole moments of paramagnetic
atoms put very stringent limits on bi terms [13]. Therefore, we will not discuss C-violating
terms in this paper and simply set bi = 0 from now on.
The modified QED, after rescaling the background v µ by absorbing the parameter a1 ,
then reads

is the dual electromagnetic tensor, F̃µν ≡ 12 µναβ F αβ . The Lorentz symmetry

SO(3, 1) is broken by the irrelevant dimension-five operators to its subgroup SO(2), which
admits the background vector v µ as an invariant tensor. At low energies, effects due to
nonrenormalizable couplings are suppressed at least by powers of 1/M , with M being some
fundamental large mass scale in the underlying theory. In the limit M → ∞, the symmetry of
the Lagrange density (2) is enhanced to the Lorentz group, along with spacetime translations.
The two LV terms in (2) have been considered in Refs. [14–16]. The crucial difference between the existing works related to these two terms and the Lagrange density (2) considered
in this paper is that the dimensionless coupling constant e in (2) is the unique gauge coupling
constant determining the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. Thus, different from
other works, we restrict our consideration to the case where electrically neutral particles will
not interact with photons at tree level. This can be seen even more transparently by letting
Aµ → eAµ so that (2) becomes

where the gauge covariant derivative now takes the form Dµ = ∂ µ + ieAµ and the 4-vector
j µ ≡ eΨγ µ Ψ = (ρ, ~j) is the current density. Apparently L reduces to the free theory for
neutral particles.
The rest of the paper is organized into three parts. In Sec. II, we examine the QED
modified by the dimension-five LV operator, j µ v ν F̃µν . The theoretical consequences of the
modified Maxwell and Dirac equations are studied. In particular, we compute the corrections
to the hydrogen spectrum by applying the perturbation theory to the exactly solved Dirac
equation. To our knowledge, the corrections to the hydrogen spectrum induced by the LV
operator j µ v ν F̃µν were calculated only in the nonrelativistic limit in the literature [15]. The
effect on the spectral lines of hydrogen atom due to the presence of a static external electric
field and a static external magnetic field is also considered. In Sec. III, we present similar
analysis on the QED modified by another dimension-five LV operator, j µ v ν Fµν . We give our
conclusions in the final section.

Lorentz symmetry of the Maxwell equations is spoiled by the nonzero effective polarization
or the nonzero effective magnetization. In the presence of stationary sources (such that

in Dirac’s theory and the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum comes out naturally from
it. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we are able to compute the first-order correction
to the hydrogen spectrum induced by δH.
Since the degenerate unperturbed states are the stationary state vectors |n, j, l, mj i of
the Dirac Hamiltonian H0 for a fixed n and j, in the absence of external fields we need to
calculate the following matrix elements of the perturbation:

nates from the CP -even operator j i v k F̃ik in L1 . We note in passing that the energy shifts
are independent of the time component v 0 of the background vector, indicating that the
hydrogen spectrum is insensitive to the breakdown of invariance under Lorentz boosts. It is
easy to show that the matrix elements (16) of the perturbation between state vectors with
different eigenvalues for the square of the orbital angular momentum L2 or the z component
Jz of the total angular momentum all vanish. Indeed, by judiciously choosing a coordinate

then that the matrix elements (16) vanishes unless l = l 0 and mj = m0j .

splitting, which is of order (me /mp )me α4 with mp being the mass of the proton, since the
irrelevant LV operator j µ v ν F̃µν is highly suppressed by some large fundamental mass scale
M mentioned in the introduction.
We are now in a position to consider the shift of the hydrogen energy levels in the presence

thus treated as a perturbation and responsible for the well-known Zeeman effect in the
nonrelativistic limit. With the LV perturbation δH, we now also need to consider the effect
~ ext − ~v · B
~ ext ) in δH. It is straightforward to show that
induced by the terms e(v 0 γ 0~γ · B
for any constant vector ~a, the matrix elements hn, j, l, mj |γ 0~γ · ~a|n, j, l0 , m0j i between the
states of the same unperturbed energy vanish. Indeed, from the explicit form of the angular
part of the matrix elements of the operator γ 0~γ ·~a between the degenerate unperturbed wave
functions, one can easily see that hn, j, l, mj |γ 0~γ ·~a|n, j, l0 , m0j i vanish for either |mj −m0j | =
6 0
or 1, or |l − l0 | 6= 1. However, when |mj − m0j | = 0 or 1, and |l − l0 | = 1, the radial integral

~ ext in δH just shifts
of hn, j, l, mj |γ 0~γ · ~a|n, j, l0 , m0j i vanishes. The constant term −e~v · B
each energy level by the same amount. Therefore, we conclude that, in the presence of the
~ ext , the hydrogen spectrum is not altered by the LV δH in first-order
uniform magnetic field B
perturbation theory.
We can also consider the change to the hydrogen energy levels in the presence of a uniform
~ ext . Again, we assume that the external electric field E
~ ext is weak so that the
electric field E
unperturbed Hamiltonian is the Dirac Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom. Besides the Stark
effect which mixes the 2s and 2p states, we also need to calculate the matrix elements of
the LV perturbation between the degenerate unperturbed states: −ehn, j, l 0 , m0j |γ 0~γ · (~v ×

~ ext is a constant vector, we know that −ehn, j, l 0 , m0 |γ 0~γ ·

~ ext )|n, j, l, mj i = 0 by the same reasoning as before, and therefore the interaction

It follows from (36) that, different from the consequence of the model L1 , a nonvanishing
electric field cannot arise from neutral sources and a nonvanishing magnetic field cannot
arise from steady and irrotational current density.
The modified Dirac equation following from L2 reads
(iD

of cos θ and terms proportional to v 0 cancel each other out. Thus the energy levels of the
hydrogen atom are not shifted by the LV perturbation δ H̃.
The shift of the hydrogen energy levels induced by δ H̃ in the presence of uniform external
fields can be easily analyzed in the same way as we did in Sec. II, assuming the external fields
~ ext and B
~ ext ) are weak. Since v 0 E
~ ext and ~v × B
~ ext are constant vectors,
(denoted again by E
using the fact that for any constant vector ~a the matrix elements hn, j, l 0 , m0j |γ 0~γ ·~a|n, j, l, mj i
~ ext shifts each energy level by the same amount,
vanish, and knowing that the interaction e~v ·E
we can conclude that, in the presence of uniform external fields, the LV perturbation δ H̃
still produces no effect on the hydrogen spectrum in first-order perturbation theory.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, QED modified by dimension-five LV operators j µ v ν F̃µν and j µ v ν Fµν has
been studied separately. In both cases, we have identified the effective polarization and
magnetization, which are components of the rank-2 object j [µ v ν] , from the field equations of
motion. In particular, we find that, with the LV interaction j µ v ν F̃µν , any charged spinor has
a spin-independent magnetic dipole moment density ρ~v , along with the one associated with
its spin. Also, a static electric field can arise from stationary and neutral sources. These
novel properties do not come up from the other interaction j µ v ν Fµν .
We have computed the shift in the energies of the states of a hydrogen atom in first-order
perturbation theory. Our result shows that only the CP -even operator j i v k F̃ik produces
the energy shifts, given by (22), and the degeneracy of each level is completely removed.
Interestingly, the breakdown of Lorentz boost symmetry, induced by the v 0 terms, in these
two models plays no role in determining the atomic energy spectrum. In the presence of
uniform external fields, both LV interactions add no new effect on the hydrogen spectrum.
It would be interesting to study the loop corrections to these two models and make
physical predictions in the framework of effective field theories. The analysis will be reported
elsewhere.
