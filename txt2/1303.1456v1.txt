to form three-dimensional structures.
The problem. of determining molecular structure at a
detailed level involves assigning three-dimensional
coordinates to each of the atoms within a molecule.
These molecules normally have on the order of 1000 to

10,000 atoms, and so we must estimate 3000 to 30,000
parameters to define a structure.

The sources of

information available for determining these structures are
experimental, theoretical and empirical/ statistical
observations. They provide structural information ranging
from geometric distances and angles to global measures of
volume, shape and proximity to the surface.
Typically,
the problem of defining a structure is underdetermined for
two reasons. First, there is insufficient information to
position each atom uniquely. Second, the data sources are
usually uncertain. It is therefore important to develop
methods for combining evidence about structure that can
handle the uncertainty explicitly. Moreover, it is critical
that such methods produce not merely a single reasonable
candidate structure, but also give some idea of the
certainty associated with the position of each atom. There
have been a few efforts to determine structure from a
combination of experimental, statistical and theoretical
data [Sippi 1990, Friedrichs 1991, Crippen 1990]. Not
one of these methods is explicitly probabilistic. We have
developed an algorithm, derived from the extended, iterated
Kalman Filter, which can take a wide range of
probabilistic constraints on structure and produce
estimates of the mean and three-dimensional variance in
the position of each atom.
To avoid local optima, the
algorithm uses a search heuristic-which is the same, in
concept (although very different in implementation), as
simulated annealing [van Laarhoven 1987, Vanderbilt
1984]. Simply stated, we iteratively estimate the
positions of the points using all available data; we allow
the algorithm to leave local optima by resetting the
elements of a variance/covariance matrix elements to high
values. By increasing the variance of the elements, we
allow unsatisfied (relatively low-variance) constraints to
make large changes in the estimates o f location, and
thereby to jump out of local optima. By iterating this
process, we have been able to identify reliably sets of
coordinates that satisfy the probabilistic constraints. We
have already applied the algorithm to a number of
experimental data-analysis tasks, and it has performed
well[Pachter 1991, Pachter 1990, Arrowsmith 1991]. The
goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to describe the
methodology in detail, while explaining how we have
borrowed concepts from simulated annealing to improve
the convergence properties; and (2) to investigate the
sensitivity of the method to perturbations in the reheating
heuristic.

The ideas used in our work should be useful

in a variety of settings where probabilistic algorithms are
searching a large space.

2 THE DATA REPRESENTATION
There are three types of information that our algorithm
uses: an estimate of the mean position of each point (or
atom), an estimate of the variance/covariance between all
coordinates of all points, and a representation of the
underlying model of the data and its noise. The notation
used here is borrowed from Gelb [Gelb 1984] and from
Smith et al [Smith 1986].
For molecular structure, the parameters to be estimated are
the coordinates of atoms in three-dimensional space. We
represent the mean positions of each atom as a vector, x,
of length 3N for N atoms:
[1]

x=[Xl Yl Zl X2 Y2 Z2

The second element of our representation is a
variance/covariance matrix for vector x. This matrix,
C(x), contains the autocovariance information for vector
x: the diagonal elements contain the variances of each
element of x, whereas the off-diagonals contain the
covariances between the elements within x:

Gx,zN

[2]

Because the coordinates can be logically grouped into
triplets (representing the x,y,z coordinates for a single
atom), we abbreviate our notation of C(x) as a matrix
with submatrices.

C(x)=

[

C(x1)

.

The off-diagonal elements of the variance/covariance
matrix contain information about the dependence between
the coordinates of two atoms (that is, the dependence of
the position of one atom on the position of the other).
Each off-diagonal element is a linear estimate of the
relationship between two coordinates. It is related to a
correlation coefficient by a normalization term. If the
element is positive, then the two coordinates are
positively correlated. This information is critical to the
search: a change in any atom position affects the position
of other atoms through this first order estimate of their
covariation. Thus, the off-diagonal 3 x 3 submatrices
represent a summary of how the position of one atom
changes as the position of another is modified. There is a
strong network aspect to this representation. As more is
learned about the relationships between atoms, the
network of dependencies grows (for example, see Figure
4). Eventually, the movement of any atom results in the
concerted movement of all other atoms based on this
covariance information. The precise mechanisms for
updating estimates of the mean vector and covariance
matrix are discussed in the next section.
2.1

REPRESENTATION OF CONSTRAINTS

We take a constraint to be any information that constrains
the possible values of the coordinates. In general, we
model constraints in the following form:
z = h(x)

C(xz)

[3]

C(XNX!)

where each of the submatrices represents the variance of a
single atom, or the covariance between two atoms.

The utility of our representation for structural display can
now be understood: the mean values for the coordinates of
each atom can be taken from the vector, x, and plotted. In
addition, the variance of each coordinate of an atom can be
extracted from the diagonal and provides the uncertainty
along each axis of the mean estimate. In fact, with the
full 3 x 3 variance/covariance information, we can
estimate the uncertainty in any direction. Figure 5 shows
the molecule with mean positions attached to form a
backbone trace, and selected uncertainties displayed to
show two standard deviations of variance.

[4]

+

v

[5]

where z is the measured constraint (that is, the value
provided by the experimental, theoretical or statistical
source of information). z can be scalar or vector. It is
modeled as having two parts: the first part is an (in
general) vector function, h(x), which is a function of the
mean vector, x. The second part of the model, v, models
the noise in the system. Given a perfect measurements, v
is zero and the measured constraint takes on the exact
value of the model function, h(x). In general, v, is a
Gaussian noise term which models the degree of certainty
in any given measurement.

Probabilistic Algorithm for Structure

Thus, for example, a measurement of distance between
two points would be represented as a function of 6
elements of the mean vector, x:
z = (( (xi - xj)2 + (yi - yj)2 + (zi - zj)2)0.5

+v

[6]

If the distance measurement refers to the distance between
two carbon atoms in a covalent bond, then the variation in
v is extremely small (the covalent bond distance varies
less than 0.1 Angstroms). If the distance measurement
refers to an experimental measurement from, for example,
a study using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), then
v will have larger variation (NMR distances vary as much
as 5 A) [Wuthrich 1985]. For the purposes of this paper,
we shall use distance measurements with different
variances to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.
We have shown elsewhere [Arrowsmith 1991, Liu 1992]
that the model is general and extends to bond angles (a
nonlinear function of nine coordinates), and dihedral angles
(a nonlinear function of twelve coordinates).
2.2

In general, the magnitude of the update in the coordinate
vector will reflect the relative certainties of the measured
and predicted values for each constraint. Thus, early in the
problem solving, when few constraints have been
introduced (assuming serial introduction of constraints), it
is relatively easy to move atoms around because they have
a large initial covariance. Later in problem solving,
however, when the estimate of the uncertainty in the
positions is lower, it is much more difficult to move
atoms unless there are very certain (that is, low-variance)
measurements.
The Kalman filter, as discussed earlier, is an optimal
estimator when h(x) is linear [Gelb 1984]. When h(x)
is nonlinear, the extended, iterated Kalman filter can be
used. This version of the filter perfonns a local search
iteratively around h(x) to find the locally optimal value
for x:
[11]
x(new)i =
x(old) + Ki{z-h(x(new)i -0 + H(x(old)-x(new)j_I)]

INTRODUCING CONSTRAINTS

Having established our representation for atomic position,
atomic uncertainty, and constraints, we can understand the
mechanism for introducing constraints and updating our
estimates of the state vector, x, and the covariance matrix
C(x).
A standard Kalman filter employs an update
algorithm of the following form [Gelb 1984]:
x(new) = x(old)
C(new)
where

[10]

(In general, the Kalman filter allows for a time-dependent
modeling of how x and h(x) change. We assume a
static molecule and do not introduce any time-dependent
model of change. We therefore are interested in
calculating a single estimate that, for example,
corresponds to time= 0.)
Simply stated, the new estimate of mean position is the
weighted difference between the old estimate of mean
position and the new positions implied by the new data.
If the measured data, z, have high variance compared with
our estimated variance in our certainty in h(x), then the
new state estimate will not be updated by much. If, on
the other hand, the measured data, z, have low variance
compared with the estimate, h(x), produced by the current
coordinate estimates, then the new coordinate estimate
will be substantially different from the current estimate.

(where i is the local iteration counter). C(x) is as defined
in Equation 8.
The extended, iterated Kalman filter has been shown to be
the optimal linear approximation to the actually nonlinear
solution. Unfortunately, the nonlinearities of structural
determination are such that the residual errors of structures
calculated by sequentially introducing constraints are still
too large. However, the solution produced by the
extended, iterated Kalman filter is typically satsifies the
input constraints better than the starting estimate (but not
good enough). Initially, we had hoped that, by serially
introducing the constraints a second time, we would
continue to improve our estimate. However, because the
covariance estimates decrease monotonically with the
introduction of each constraint, it becomes harder and
harder to move atoms out of the local minima defined by
the extended, iterated Kalman filter.
2.3

HEATING TO AVOID LOCAL OPTIMA

Our approach to the solution of the problem of local
minima was inspired by the work in simulated annealing
[van Laarhoven 1987, Vanderbilt 1984]. After serially
introducing the constraints on the structure, we are left
with an improved estimate of x, but also a covariance
matrix C(x) that is unwilling to allow atoms to move
out of the local minima, in the sense that extremely low­
variance measurements would be required to move an atom
far from the estimate. We introduce "heat" by resetting
the covariances to their initial (large) values, and thus
allow unsatisfied constraints to have a relatively greater
effect on the vector, x. We then reintroduce all the
constraints once again, but sorted such that the constraints
that were least satisfied by the previous coordinate
estimates are introduced into the solution earliest. We

26

Altman

believe (and have tested in experiments described later in
this section) that by reheating the covariances and
introducing the constraints in reverse order of satisfaction,
we maximize the chance that the atoms will be
reorganized radically and will jump out of the current
minima. Since we have observed a consistent ability of
the iterated, extended Kalman filter to improve upon its
starting estimates, we simply repeat the cycle of search,
reheat, search until the residual errors are acceptable (see
outline of procedure). Although we have not made any
formal claims about resistance to minima, there are three
forces acting to help the algorithm avoid (or leave)
multiple minima. First, we use a covariance matrix to
capture the first-order correlation between atomic
coordinates; therefore, moving even a few atoms causes
changes in the entire molecule (and more coverage of the
search space). Second, the reheating allows atoms to
move from one local minima to another in a rational way:
Atoms will not move arbitrarily in space, but will move
along a vector whose magnitude is consistent with the
known initial excursion of the atom. Third, the reordering
of serial constraints allows the constraints that are violated
to dominate the initial reorganization of the structure.
The performance of our algorithm is illustrated in the next
section with an example.

EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED

To illustrate the performance of the program on a typical
data set, we have chosen the problem of defining the
topology of a small protein, crambin [Hendrickson 1981].
Crambin
contains roughly 500 atoms, but for the
purposes of this example, we considered only the 46
backbone heavy atoms that define the general topology of
the molecule. The structure of crambin is known, so we
generated synthetic data sets for these tests. In general,
there are 1035 distances between 46 atoms.
The
minimum number of exact distances required to define the
position of N points is 4N-10, or 526 is the case of
crambin. The state (coordinate) vector, therefore, has 134
parameters and the covariance matrix is 134 x 134. For
all calculations, the starting values for the x vector were
generated randomly between 0 and 50 Angstroms. The
covariance matrix was initialized to have all diagonal
elements at 100 (that is, a starting variance of 100 A 2

for each atom), and off-diagonal elements set to

0

(implying independence of all coordinates initially)I. We
could introduce a less random initial model, if we had
information about the type of structure we might be
expecting. In this case, we assume no critical prior
information about the structure. We performed the
following tests:

distances (1035), with extremely low variance.

In this paper, we illustrate the convergence properties of
the method under conditions of noise and sparse data. We
also investigate the importance of the sorting step (Step
7) so that we can better understand the mechanism
whereby the reheating step improves convergence. We are
testing the hypothesis that, by sorting the constraints in
reverse order of satisfaction, we increase the ability of
false optima solutions to be abandoned. Alternatively, the
heating itself may be the only key step, and the order of
constraints may not be critical.

improvement to an average error of 0.000 7 SD (maximum
of 0.002) was achieved at cycle 58. Cycles 59 through
1000 made no further improvement. The structure that
resulted was identical to the target solution, as expected.
Test2: With 33% of all exact distances, the starting
average error was 62 SD (maximum, 158 SD). Figures 1
and 2 illustrate the performance of each of the three
strategies for ordering constraints. Sorting in r�verse
order of error (in SDs) consistently lead to the qmckest
convergence. A fixed order of constraints consistently
converged poorly. The peak at cycle 6 for the maximum
error of the fixed order constraints represents a jump out of
a local minima at cycle 5, witll subsequent convergence
by cycle 9. All three methods produced structm:es that
matched the solution to a root mean squared distance

yielded a best solution with average error 0.58 SD
(maximum: 2.53 SD). Test 3B yielded a best solution
with average error 0.76 SD (maximum: 2.81 SD). More
important, the structures generated by these data sets
matched the target solution to a RMSD of 2.0 A and 3.7

molecule is 30 A, these represent good estimates of
structure, and clearly show the general topology of the

DISCUSSION

The Kalman filter has proven to be a versatile tool since
its inception in the early 1960s. It is an optimal filter
for linear problems. For nonlinear problems, it has been
shown to be the optimal linear solution [Gelb 1984]. The
extended, iterated Kalman filter has proven useful as a

suboptimal estimator for nonlinear problems as well.
However, it is suboptimal, and for problems requiring
high accuracy, it can fall short. In this paper, we have
shown that resetting the covariance matrix allows the
algorithm to converge reliably in nonlinear problems such
as molecular structure based on distance information.
Whereas simulated annealing protocols require a cooling
procedure to induce equilibration, our algorithm allows the
serial introduction of constraints to cool the structure. We
have not yet experimented with more sophisticated ways
to reheat the covariance matrix. However, the current
method simply throws away the covariance information
derived during a single cycle (cf. step 6 in the procedure
outline), and we are investigating more intelligent ways to
reheat We have shown that the performance degrades
gracefully as noise is added, and constraints are subtracted.
Both with 33% and 10% of all distances (and with noise
added), we were able to find reasonable topologies for the
test molecule.
Our experiments with different constraint orders confirm
our hypothesis that the reheating of the covariance matrix
allows the solution space to be explored more effectively.
A fixed order of constraints is more likely to explore the
same general hypothesis space, and to converge more
slowly than either a random order or an order in which the
most dissatisfied constraints take the "first shot" at

Each value is the norm of the submatrix C(Xij) of the

individual atoms (along the diagonal) are for the most part,
larger than the covariances between atoms. There is a
region of particularly high covariation between atoms 45
and 5. There is a region of low covariation between atoms
40 and 18.

altering the solution.
One advantage of our method is that the ending conditions
for the search (average or maximum SD or errors) are not
part of the machinery of search. We can therefore easily
change our error metric and end conditions (step 5 in the
procedural outline). Usually, we search for the x vector
that has the minimum average error. However, the error
profile of the resulting structure (such as shown in Figure
4) is actually better than the variances on the constraints

Although we have concentrated in this paper on the use
of distance constraints between points, the mathematical
form of the filter makes it clear that (1) any function of
the coordinates can be used as a constraint model, and (2)
these functions need not be scalar, but rather can be
vector functions. In our work so far, we have limited
ourselves to distances, angles, and dihedral angles because
these types of constraints are sufficient for most structure
determinations from NMR data. However, as we collect
statistical data on the associations between certain types of

imply! That is, our distribution of errors should reflect
the variance of the measurements in these errors, but they
do not. We may, therefore, be overfitting our data. In
the case of extremely precise measurements (such as test
1, 2a,bc, and 4a) overfitting is difficult to demonstrate
because the answer is so precisely constrained. When we
have extremely sparse or noisy data, however, we may
discard superior solutions.
Current work focuses on
using other metrics to evaluate possible solutions.

atoms and aggregates of atoms, we can use statistical
distributions as constraints on our molecule. With respect
to the use of vector functions, we have avoided them so
far (and preferred the serial introduction of scalar
constraints) because this allows the inverse term in
equation 9 to remain a scalar, and thus avoids a matrix
inversion--which would be computationally expensive (to
do or to avoid).
We have run tests on the serial
introduction of constraints versus parallel introduction (for
example, the vector z can contain all the distance
measurements, and v contains all the variances). We have

found that, 'with all the information available, a greater
improvement in the solution occurs per cycle, but that the
cost per cycle increases such that the two strategies are
roughly equivalent.

RELATED WORK

There are two lines of research that are related to the work
described here. The first is that of molecular structure
determination. Distance geometzy. is an algorithm which
takes as input a set of distances between atoms within a
molecule. It employs a clever eigenanalysis of a matrix
derived from these distances to estimate the coordinates of
the structure [Havel1984, Havel 1983]. It only refers to
min/max boundaries on parameter values for input, and
produces as output a single solution. To estimate the
uncertainty in the structure, it is necessary to run the
algorithm many times and collect statistics over the
population of structures. Energy minimization and
molecular dynam ics are algorithms for structure
determination which are based on the assumption that the
proper conformation of a molecule is the one that has the
lowest free energy [Nemethy 1990, Levitt 1988]. Energy
terms that describe the interactions between all pairs of
atoms within a structure can be defined, and optimization
methods can be applied to find the conformation of the
structure that has the lowest energy.
Uncertainty is
represented to some extent within the energy profiles
(which are related to probabilities by the Boltzmann
relation). These algorithms are based on physical forces,
and it is difficult to know how to consider probabilistic
sources of data. A detailed comparison between our
algorithm and these other approaches (varying constraint
abundance, precision of constraints, size of molecule) has
been published and shows that the time for a single DIKF
calculation to converge is equivalent to roughly 10
molecular dynamics runs and 100 distance geometry runs
[Liu 1992].
The second line of research related to our work is that in
optimization and parameter estimation [Gelb 1984]. The
relationship of our method to the standard extended,
iterated Kalman filter is clear: We are simply re-iterating
and reintroducing constraints after adjusting the covariance
matrix and reordering our constraints. Our method
therefore is a member of the class of nonlinear least­
squares-like estimator that seeks the most likely set of
coordinates that best satisfy the input constraints. It is
Bayesian because it uses an initial model of the solution
(in these experiments the model was randomly genemted).
Our method uses a first-order approximation to the
nonlinearities of the system, and improves its performance
by iteration. Simulated annealing is a computational
method for assisting optimization by providing a powerful
heuristic for efficient search [van Laarhoven 1987,
Vanderbilt 1984]. Based on an analogy to solid-state
physics, simulated annealing protocols add "heat" to an
optimization to increase the likelihood that a solution will

jump out of a local optima. The solution is then allowed
to "cool" slowly such that it settles into a new
optimum-as a cooled solid might settle into a new
crystalline packing. Our method shares many high level
concepts with simulated annealing: By increasing the
variances and covariances, we are increasing the range of
possible values for each parameter, and by introducing the
constraints in reverse order of satisfaction, we give the
least satisfied constraints a chance to pull the solution out
of a local minima. Although it is heuristic in nature, we
have found that this protocol reliably finds low average
error structures, as well as low maximum errors [Pachter
1990, Liu 1992].

CONCLUSIONS

The chief limitations to our method are the assumption of
Gaussian noise in the constraints, and the assumption of
Gaussian distribution when drawing the calculated
structures.
Gaussian noise is clearly not a valid
assumption for many constraints that we would like to
use. There is a body of literature on the use of Kalman
filters with non-Gaussian noise, and we are currently
investigating its applicability to our technique [Sorenson
1970]. Our algorithm produces a two-moment estimate of
atomic location (three-dimensional mean and variance).
For purposes of display, we assume that these represent
the first two moments of a three-dimensional Gaussian
when drawing atomic locations. Of course, it is possible
that some atoms will have a bimodal distribution, and we
are unable to capture these distributions currently.
Moving to multimodal representations of atomic position
is not a priority in our work for two reasons. First, as
more independent data sources are introduced, the three­
dimensional Gaussian becomes the most likely final
distribution by the central limit theorum. Second, there
are few biological examples of significant bimodal
distributions.
In this paper, we have introduced our algorithm, illustrated
its performance on a set of test problems, and investigated
convergence speed as a function of the order in which
constraints are introduced. We have shown that:
1. A probabilistic formulation of molecular structure
determination is natural, and provides a common language
in which multiple data sources can be combin�.
2. The double iterated kalman filter (DIKF) represents one
possible implementation of an engine to determine
probabilistic structures. It employs a search heuristic
similar to simulated annealing, and is able to converge to
reasonable solutions under a variety of circumstances,
including data with varying levels of noise and abundance.
3. The DIKFs mechanism for sorting constraints in order
of decreasing error (after reheating) leads to a more
efficient search for low average error structures, when

compared with a random and fixed order of constraints.
Each of the three strategies produces the same result
eventually, but with a different efficiency. These results
support the contention that the reheating step works
because it allows local optima to be avoided.
