difference between the two architectures is step 4 of

In the outward pass, on the other hand, the differ­

nounced. Consider clique C which, in the inward pass,
has absorbed messages from C2, . . . , Cn and sent a

This fact is exploited in the Hugin architecture to
avoid performing repeated multiplications. Hence, in
the outward pass of the Hugin algorithm a clique C can
compute the product of all messages from its neigh­
bours simply by 'substituting' one term of ¢c using
division. Thus, the main difference between the Hugin
and the Shafer-Shenoy architectures is the use of di­
vision. As we shall see later, avoiding division is ad­
vantageous when we use nested junction trees for in­
ference.

Basically, the trick in Eq. 2 is all there is to inference
in Bayesian networks. In fact, the first general infer­

Cannings, Thompson & Skolnick (1976) used exactly

that method. Their method is referred

to as "peel­

ing", since the variables are peeled off one by one un­
til the desired marginal has been computed. In most
inference methods for Bayesian networks, finding the
peeling order (elimination order) is done

as

one-off process. That is, the acyclic, directed graph of

a complete subgraph. A junction tree is then con­
structed through triangulation of the moral graph.
Thus, in our example, the undirected graph induced
by the potentials ¢sll c/Js2, ¢s3, and ¢v1 may be
depicted as in Figure 2. At first sight this graph
looks quite messy, and it might be hard to be­
lieve that its triangulated graph will be anything
but a complete graph. However, a closer exam­
ination reveals that the graph is already triangu­
lated and that its cliques are {83, 84, 97, 164, 168} and
{22,26,83,84,94,95,97,168}.

down. The two potentials induce the graph shown in
Figure 4, hence a further break-down is possible as the
graph is triangulated and contains two cliques.

Figure 2: The undirected graph induced by potentials
¢sl, ¢s2, ¢s3, and ¢v,.
So, the original 9-clique (i.e., clique containing nine
variables) with a table of size 2,625,000 has been re­
duced to a junction tree with a 5-clique and an 8-clique
with tables of total size 381,000 (including a separator
table of size 750).
Thus encouraged we shall try to continue our clique
break-down! In the two-clique junction tree, the 5clique has associated with it only potential ¢s2, so
it cannot be further broken down. The 8-clique, on
the other hand, has got the remaining three potentials
associated with it. These potentials (i.e., ¢s1, ¢s3, and
¢v,) induce the graph shown in Figure 3.
This graph also appears to be triangulated and con­
tains the 5-clique {22, 26, 94,95,97} and the 7-clique
{22, 26, 83, 84, 94,95,168} with tables of total size
78,000 (including a separator table of size 500). The
reduced space cost is 375,000- 78,000 297,000.
=

In this junction tree, the 7-clique cannot be further
broken down since it contains only one potential. The
5-clique, however, contains two potentials, ¢s3 and
¢v1 , and can therefore possibly be further broken

Figure 4: The undirected graph induced by potentials
¢s3 and ¢v ,.
Now, no further break-down is possible. The result­
ing nested junction tree, shown in Figure 5, has a
total space cost of 81,730, which is significantly less
than the original 2, 625,000. Carrying out the nesting
to this depth, however, have a big time cost, since,
for example, 500 message passings is needed through
the separator {83,84, 97,168} in order to generate the
message from C16 to C13. A proper balance between
space and time costs will most often be of interest. We
shall address that issue in the next section.
3

SPACE AND TIME COSTS

As already discussed in Section 2, the smallest space
cost of sending a message from a clique C equals the
accumulated size of the clique and separator tables of
the nested junction tree(s) induced by the potentials
of C (i.e., messages sent to C and potentials initially

Given this information we can now do our calculations.
Generating a message involves the operations of multi­
plication (of the relevant potentials) and marginaliza­
tion. The cost of multiplying the two potentials onto
the clique table is 2 times the table size. The cost of
marginalization equals the table size. Therefore, the
time cost of sending a message from clique Cb is

the sum of the costs of sending a message (i.e, a proba­
bility potential) and the sum of the cost messages from
its remaining neighbours. Then a cost message states
the cost of letting the sender be root in the subtre e
containing the sender and the subtrees from which it
received its messages. Thus, when C has received cost
messages from all of its neighbours, the overall cost
of an inward probability propagation is given by the

sum of its cost messages plus the co st of computing
the C-marginal potential.

lecting Ce as root instead would have a cost of

that this could be done much more efficiently, since

To investigate the practical relevance of nested junc­
tion trees, the cost propagation scheme described
above has been implemented as an extension to the
Hugin algorithm.

In order to find a proper balance

between space and time costs, the algorithm makes a
junction tree representation of a clique only if

Table 3 shows that the time costs associated with min­

of conventional (inward) propagation. Thus, although
maximum nesting yields minimum space cost, it is not
recommended in general, since the associated time cost
may be unacceptably large.

Space and time costs for inward propagation of probability potentials using

(i)

the conventional method,

and the nested jun ction trees method with (ii) maximum nesting (minimum space cost), (iii) maximum average
relative saving of space and time costs, and (iv ) minimum time cost. The percentages in parentheses are the
relative savings compared to conventional propagation.
