speeding up value iteration.

VALUE ITERATION

A value function is a mapping from the set S of pos­
sible states to the real line. Given a value function V,
define another value function TV by

TV(s)= max0[r(s,a) + 'Y

L P(s'ls,a)V(s')]

When the MDP is acyclic, GVI is identical to Boyan

the optimal value function. When the MDP is cyclic,
however, the value function it returns could be of very
poor quality. Using it a.s a preprocessing step to VI
might not help much.

IMPROVING PVI

The alternative understanding of DVI can be used to
improve PVI. We call the improved algorithm PVIl.

EXPERIMENTS

Preliminary experiments have been carried to compare
the algorithms proposed in this paper with standard
value iteration. Four office environment navigation

problems borrowed from Ca.ssandra et al (1996) were
used . The problems differ in corridor layout and the
total number of states. There are two sets of transition
probabilities, referred to a.s standard and noisy tran­
sition probabilities respectively. Effects of actions are
less certain under noisy transition probabilities than
under standard transition probabilities.
