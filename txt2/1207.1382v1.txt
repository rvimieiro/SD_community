methodology to Bayesian networks; that is, directed graphical models. Unlike Markov network models, Bayesian
networks require that additional normalization constraints
be satisfied; namely that the local clique potentials represent conditional probability distributions. These constraints are very different from the standard Euclidean normalization constraints of SVMs. Nevertheless, they do not
preclude the possibility of learning large margin classifiers.
Our goal is simply to exploit the benefits of learning maximum margin classifiers, while still being able to represent
the learned classifier as a Bayesian network.
There are several motivations for attempting to maintain
a Bayesian network representation. First, the classification model being learned could be a fragment of a much
larger probabilistic causal model. In this case, maintaining
a Bayesian network representation could allow one to integrate the learned model with a pre-existing background
model without additional effort. Second, the normalization
constraints asserted by a directed graphical structure capture nonparametric causal knowledge about the domain.
Therefore, respecting these constraints allows one to exploit the advantages of Bayesian networks for capturing intuitive causal structure. Note that removing the normalization constraints would turn the Bayesian network into
a Markov network, and this would necessarily remove the
causal knowledge that was originally encoded by the local
normalization constraints.
To understand both the prospects and limitations of learning maximum margin Bayesian network classifiers we proceed as follows. First, after preliminary definitions in Section 2, we investigate the notion of classification margin for
Bayesian network classifiers in Section 3, and relate this to
the common conditional likelihood criterion of graphical
models. We then present a convex relaxation in Section 4

that can be used to derive an effective training algorithm
(Section 5). The algorithm solves a wide range of problems exactly and otherwise provides an effective heuristic
for finding approximate solutions (Section 6). In Section 7
we then present experimental results which show that the
causal information in Bayesian networks can yield effective generalization performance when the directed graphical structure captures relevant causal knowledge. Finally,
we extend the approach to multivariate classification in
Section 8 and present further experimental results in Section 9.

make predictions, one usually considers the maximum conditional probability prediction arg maxy P (y|x). Note that
for graphical models the conditional probability depends
only on variables that share some common function (CPT)
with Y (the Markov blanket of Y ), and therefore we will
restrict attention to this set of variables henceforth.
We are interested in learning the parameters for a
Bayesian network classifier given training data of the form
(x1 y 1 ), ..., (xT y T ). Two standard training criteria to maximize during training are the joint loglikelihood and the conditional loglikelihood, given respectively by

Bayesian networks

We assume we are given a Bayesian network which is defined by a directed acyclic graph over variables X1 , ..., Xn ,
where the probability of a configuration x is given by

Here θ denotes the parameters of the model; j ranges over

using the substitution wjab = ln θjab , where φ(x) denotes
the feature vector (...1(xj =ab) ...)> over j, a, b. The key
aspect of the exponential form is that it expresses p(x|w)
as a convex function of the parameters w, which would
seem to suggest convenient optimization problems. However, Bayesian networks also require the imposition of additional normalization constraints over each variable

Unfortunately, these constraints are nonlinear, even though
the log-objective is linear in w. Removing these constraints
greatly reduces the computational challenge of training,
but also removes the causal interpretability of the model.
Therefore, our goal in this paper is to maintain the Bayesian
network constraints while investigating the consequences.

Discriminative training criteria

We initially assume there is a single classification variable
Y taking on values y ∈ {1, .., K}. (We will extend this
to multiple classification variables in Section 8 below.) To

Much of the literature suggests that the latter objective is
better suited for classification (Lafferty et al., 2001; Friedman et al., 1997), although conditions have been identified where the former is advantageous (Ng & Jordan, 2001;
Raina et al., 2003).
In this paper we investigate an alternative criterion based on
the large margin criteria of SVMs. In particular, we adopt
the multiclass margin definition of (Crammer & Singer,
2001). In our context, this objective can be cast maximizing the minimum conditional likelihood ratio (MCLR)

Thus our goal is to find a set of parameters θ that maximizes
the minimum margin between the target classification label against the best alternative under the probability model.
(We introduce slack variables to obtain a soft margin version of the criterion below.)
To see the connection to SVMs more clearly, note that one
can substitute the exponential form of P (x, y|w) into the
MCLR objective, to obtain
log M CLR(w)

where ∆(i, y) = [φ(xi , y i ) − φ(xi , y)]> . Here the row
vector ∆(i, y) plays the role of the feature vector for training example i and class label y, and therefore we can
write the entire set of feature vectors as a matrix ∆ of size
(T K)× (number of features).

Thus, starting with the training objective (6), through a
change of parameters, we are led to a training problem that
can be cast as a conventional maximum margin problem
max γ
w,γ

subject to

∆w ≥ γδ,

kwk ≤ 1

(8)

where δ(i,y) = 1(y6=yi ) . Notice that here we have added the
normalization constraint kwk ≤ 1. Obviously some form
of normalization is necessary to avoid making ∆w large in
a trivial manner just by making w large. Euclidean normalization happens to yield a weight vector that maximizes the
Euclidean margin (Schoelkopf & Smola, 2002). The resulting constrained optimization problem corresponds to the
standard version of multiclass SVMs proposed in (Crammer & Singer, 2001) (ignoring slacks), here expressed over
features determined by the Bayesian network.
In fact, this is the connection between probabilistic and
large margin classifiers that is one of the main observations
of (Taskar et al., 2003; Altun et al., 2003), who then proceed to use standard SVM training criteria over these features. Note however that the solution weight vector for (8)
cannot be substituted into the Bayesian network representation, because it will not satisfy the proper normalization
constraints (3). The previous techniques of (Taskar et al.,
2003; Altun et al., 2003) were able to proceed by using an
undirected graphical model which could accommodate unnormalized weights in the potential function. However, for
Bayesian networks this is not sufficient, and there is usually no way to represent the same classifier in the original
Bayesian network structure.
The alternative approach we consider, therefore, is to maximize the same objective, but subject to constraints that preserve representability as a Bayesian network

Unfortunately, these natural constraints on w are nonlinear
and this yields a difficult optimization problem. Attempts
to reformulate the problem according to standard transformations also fail. For example, the probability function
(1) is neither concave nor convex in the parameters θ, even
though the equality constraints (3) are linear in θ. The
standard trick of removing the normalization
constraints

the maximum margin Bayesian network training problem
exactly, we require a more subtle approach.

Convex relaxation

Although solving for the maximum margin Bayesian network parameters appears to be a hard problem, we can de-

rive a practical training algorithm that still solves the problem for a wide range of graph topologies, and otherwise
provides a useful foundation for approaches that seek local
maxima. The main idea is to try to exploit convexity in the
problem as much as possible, and identify situations where
the solutions to a convex subproblem can be maintained.
First note that the objective in (9) is a linear function of
w. Unfortunately, the normalization constraints are nonlinear equalities on w, which eliminates the convexity of the
problem. However, our basic observation is that the problem can be made convex simply by relaxing these equality
constraints to inequality constraints, thus yielding a simple
relaxation
X
ewjab ≤ 1 ∀j, b (10)
max γ subject to ∆w ≥ γδ,

The solution to this problem will of course be subnormalized. The key fact about the relaxed problem (10) however,
is that it is convex in w and this will permit effective algorithmic approaches (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).1
It is interesting to compare the two convex optimization
problems (8) and (10), which correspond to maximum
margin Markov networks and Bayesian networks respectively. These problems have identical objectives and margin constraints on w, but differ only in the normalization
constraints—one global constraint for Markov networks
versus multiple local constraints for Bayesian networks.
The solutions to the two problems will obviously be different. Intuitively, the Bayesian network constraints might
regularize the weights more comprehensively in the sense
that each local CPT is constrained to have identical maximum influence, whereas a Markov network could concentrate its weight in a single local function.
4.1

Slack variables

Before tackling real problems we need to introduce slack
variables, since it is obviously not practical to use a hard
margin formulation on real data. To this end, we consider
the standard soft margin formulation of SVMs
min
w,ξ

1
kwk2 + Cξ > e subject to ∆w ≥ δ − Sξ
2

(11)

where ξ are the slack variables; e denotes the vector of all
1 entries; S is a T K × T sparse matrix with nonzero entries S((i, y), i) = 1 (which enforces the constraint that
∆(i, y)w ≥ γ δ(i,y) − ξi for all i, y); and C is a parameter
1

Note that the inequality form of the norm constraints in (8)
and (9) is not vacuous: In either case, reducing the magnitude
of the weights only has the effect of reducing the inner products
in the margin constraints (∆w), which can only yield a smaller
margin γ. The maximization objective naturally forces the weight
magnitudes overall to become large as possible, subject to the normalization constraints.

that controls the slack effect (Crammer & Singer, 2001).2
For our purposes, we need to state this objective explicitly
in terms of the margin γ. It can be shown that (11) is equivalent to (Lanckriet et al., 2004)
min

w,γ,ξ

1
+ Cξ > e
2γ 2

(12)

Thus, by replacing the Euclidean constraint with the
Bayesian network subnormalization constraint, we obtain
min

w,γ,ξ

1
+ Cξ > e
2γ 2

subject to ∆w ≥ γ(δ − Sξ),
P wjab

(13)

The two problems, (12) and (13), specify the soft margin
formulations of maximum margin Markov and Bayesian
networks respectively. Unfortunately, neither formulation
is convex because the quadratic term γ(δ − Sξ) is nonconvex in the optimization variables γ and ξ (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004). For Markov networks one can simply
convert (12) back to (11) and thus convexify the problem.3
For Bayesian networks we can instead solve the following
problem with alternative slack variables  and parameter B
1
+ B> e
min
w,γ, 2γ 2

subject to ∆w ≥ γδ − S,
P wjab
γ ≥ 0,
≤ 1 ∀j, b (14)
ae

Provided γ ≥ 0—which we henceforth assume—the problem formulation (14) is convex and is equivalent to (13).
Thus, this formulation yields a convex version of the soft
margin training problem for Bayesian networks.

min max L(w, γ, , η, λ, ν) subject to η, λ, ν ≥ 0 (16)

w,γ, η,λ,ν

Unfortunately, this Lagrangian is not nearly as convenient
as the one for the SVM formulation (11), and a closed form
solution for the dual is not readily obtainable in this case.
For example, one cannot easily eliminate the primal variables from this problem: taking the partial derivative with
respect to wjab yields
∂L
∂wjab

Proposition 1 Assuming γ ≥ 0, (w, γ, ξ) is an optimal
point for C in (13) if and only if (w, γ, ) is an optimal
point for B in (14) with  = γξ and B = C/γ.
So if one chooses an optimal regularization parameter B
for (14), then the optimal solution (w, γ) will be preserved,
while the slacks ξ can be recovered by ξ = /γ.
We now proceed to develop algorithmic approaches for
solving the convex training problem (14), with the goal of
ultimately comparing maximum margin Markov networks
trained under (11) versus Bayesian networks trained under
(14).

A training algorithm

To solve (14) first consider the Lagrangian
L(w, γ, , η, λ, ν)
2
Note that ξ ≥ 0 is already implied, because ∆(i, y i ) = 0
and δ(i, y i ) = 0 for all i.
3
It is of course no surprise that optimization problems can be
converted between convex and nonconvex formulations without
affecting the location of the optimal solution.

λjb ewjab − η > ∆jab

(17)

where ∆jab denotes the jab column of ∆. The difficulty
with (17) is that one cannot set this derivative to zero because η > ∆jab can be negative (∆ has negative entries).
Nevertheless, the problem remains convex.
Rather than use a Lagrangian approach to solve this problem, we instead consider a standard barrier approach. In
fact, barrier methods are among the most effective techniques for solving convex constrained optimization problems (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004; Vanderbei, 1996). In
this approach one simply replaces the constraints with log
barrier functions.

The parameter µ is initially set to a reasonable value to ensure numerical stability, and then successively reduced to
sharpen the barriers. In general, it can be shown that for
convex inequality constraints, the resulting unconstrained
objective (18) is also convex, while the solution to (18) converges to (14) as µ → 0 (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004). In
the standard path following technique, an optimal solution
(w, γ, ) is obtained for the current value of µ (usually using a second order method to ensure fast convergence), after which µ is decreased, until a small value of µ is reached.
In our case, for the inner optimization loop, we implemented a Newton descent based on computing the gradient
and Hessian of (18) with respect to (w, γ, ). We found
that 7 outer iterations, µ(k+1) = µ(k) /10, µ(1) = 1, and
fewer than 20 inner Newton iterations were required to obtain accurate solutions. In principle, the runtime of a barrier

iteration method is not dramatically slower than solving a
quadratic program (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004). However, our Matlab implementation is currently an order of
magnitude slower than the quadratic program solver we
used (CPLEX). Our largest runtimes in the experiments below are a few minutes, versus a few seconds for CPLEX.

It turns out that a wide range of network topologies admit
a simple procedure for renormalizing the local functions so
that they become proper CPTs, without affecting the conditional probability of y given x. In fact, this observation
has been previously made by (Wettig et al., 2002; Wettig
et al., 2003). We present a simpler view here. In fact, it is
easy to characterize when an unnormalized Bayesian network classifier can be renormalized to preserve P (y|x).
Proposition 2 An unnormalized directed graphical model,
defined by the Markov blanket of y, can be renormalized
to preserve the decision function P (y|x) if and only if the
parents of all children of y are moralized.
The intuition behind this result is fairly straightforward.
Consider an unnormalized local function f (x, z) in a
Bayesian network structure and assume we want to normalize it over x. Such a function can always be multiplied by a
factor ρz for each z, as long as there is another local function f (z, q) that can be divided by the same factor. (That is,
a local function that contains all the parents z of x.) That is,
if an accompanying f (z, q) always exists, as in Figure 1,
we can always renormalize f (x, z). Since the functions
and variables follow an acyclic ordering in a Bayesian network, child variables can be sequentially renormalized bottom up without affecting previous normalizations. Finally,
the factor containing the y variable can be renormalized to
preserve P (y|x).
This renormalization strategy only fails if, at any stage, the
parent variable set z is not contained in a single local function, but is instead split between separate local functions,
as in Figure 2. In this case, there would be no way to coordinate the compensation for ρz (without adding a new
local function over z). Thus, in the end, we are left with
an intuitive sufficient condition for when a Bayesian network can be renormalized: Any graph can be normalized

y

Figure 1: Illustration of renormalizable graphs

Exact case: Locally moralized graphs

Before presenting experiments, we first consider when the
solutions to the relaxed problem (14) correspond to the solutions to the exact problem; i.e., satisfying (3). Our main
concern is that the solutions obtained to (14) may not be
representable in a Bayesian network because the parameters w are subnormalized, not normalized. This leaves us
with the question of determining when these subnormalized solutions can be converted into properly normalized
Bayesian networks obeying the correct equality constraints
(3).

Figure 2: A graph that cannot be renormalized
without affecting P (y|x) if the child variables can be eliminated without adding any new edges. In these cases, we
can recover a normalized model without affecting the optimality of the solution to (14), and thus we obtain a global
maximum of (7) with respect to (3).
Corollary 1 For a directed graphical model satisfying
Proposition 2, (14) is equivalent to satisfying (3) in addition.
Note that the renormalization procedure can be applied to
any set of parameters defining the decision rule P (y|x) in
such a network structure, even if the parameters were produced by a Markov network training procedure. However,
this does not imply that the resulting model P (y|x) is optimal under the Bayesian network criterion (14).

Experimental results

To evaluate the utility of learning maximum margin
Bayesian networks, we conducted some simple experiments on both real and synthetic data sets. In the synthetic experiments, we fixed a Bayesian network structure
and parameters, and used it to generate training and test
data. The goal of the synthetic experiments is to run a

with several network topologies and parameterizations, and
compared maximum margin Bayesian networks (M2 BN)
trained according to (14) against maximum margin Markov
networks (M3 N) trained according to (11), and also against
maximum conditional likelihood (MCL). The results are
for 100 repetitions of the training sample. For each method,
on each model, the regularization parameters, B and C respectively, were optimized on one train/test split and then
fixed for the duration of the experiment.

The first synthetic experiments were conducted on the networks shown in Figure 3. Here we fixed a network structure
and then defined the generative model by selecting parameters from a skewed distribution. We used a parameter β
to control the skewness of the conditional distributions of
each child, where a value of β = 1 makes each child a
deterministic function of the parents, and β = 0.5 gives
each child a uniform distribution, rendering them effectively independent of their parents. Figure 4 shows a the
comparison of the three strategies, M2 BN, M3 N, and MCL
for the first network topology shown in Figure 3. This network topology satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2, and
therefore M2 BN computes a globally optimal solution in
this case. Here we see that for a range of generative models defined by β and several training sample sizes, M2 BN
demonstrates a systematic advantage over both M3 N and
MCL, although MCL is clearly stronger than M3 N in this
case. Figure 5 shows the same comparison using the second
network topology from Figure 3. This network no longer
satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2, and therefore our
training algorithm is no longer guaranteed to produce an
optimal normalized solution (only an optimal subnormalized solution). Nevertheless, we see that M2 BN holds a
slight advantage over M3 N in this case. MCL proves to be
slightly better here. M2 BN appears to have an advantage in
cases where it is exact (Proposition 2), but the advantage is
diminished in the subnormalized case.
For a more realistic comparison, we also experimented with
real data from the UCI repository. Specifically, we used
17 data sets: australian∗ , breast, chess, cleve, diabetes∗ ,
flare∗ , glass, glass2∗ , heart, hepatitis∗ , iris∗ , lymphography, mofn∗ , pima∗ , vehicle∗ , vote, and waveform. In each
case, we formulated a Bayesian network topology that was
intended to capture the causal structure of the domain, but
in this case had no guarantee that the presumed structure
was correct. The network structures we used were automatically generated using the “PowerConstructor” technique
discussed in (Cheng & Greiner, 1999). These networks are
much larger and cannot be easily visualized here. Nevertheless, in 9 of the 17 cases the network topologies satisfied
the conditions of Proposition 2 (marked ∗ above), and 8 of
the 17 data sets did not. For each data set we considered 5

different training sample sizes, t =10, 20, 30, 40, 50. For
each t we sampled 5 different training sets (disjoint where
possible), tested on the remainder, and report average results. Interestingly, Figure 6 shows that M2 BN obtains an
overall advantage over M3 N. Perhaps surprisingly, M2 BN
also shows a slight overall advantage over MCL on these
data sets; see Figure 7.

cutting plane method, where initially only a small subset
of constraints in ∆w ≥ γδ − S were considered. Given
a current set of constraints, a solution (w, γ, ) was computed using the barrier method outlined above. Then for
each training example (xi , yi ) one new labeling y was generated to maximize the degree of constraint violation

Finally, we consider the key extension of (Taskar et al.,
2003; Altun et al., 2003; Collins, 2002) to multivariate
classification. In this setting, we observe training data
(x1 , y1 ), ..., (xT , yT ) as before, but now the targets yi are
vectors of correlated classifications. The first main issue
is to adapt the training criterion (8) to the multivariate prediction case. Following (Taskar et al., 2003) we scale the
margin between a target class vector y i and an alternative
vector y proportional to the number of misclassifications.
That is, we simply set
X
δ(i,y) =
(19)
1(yki 6=yk )
k

for multivariate predictions. This immediately yields multivariate versions of the training problems (11) and (14).
The primary difficulty in dealing with the multivariate form
of these problems is coping with the exponential number
of constraints in ∆w ≥ γδ − S. That is, one now has to
assert ∆(i, y)w ≥ γδ (i,y) − i for all training examples
i, over all possible label vectors y. Such a constraint set
is too large to handle explicitly, and an approach must be
developed for handling them implicitly.
One of the key results in (Taskar et al., 2003) is showing that, for maximum margin Markov networks (11),
the constrained optimization problem can be factored and
re-expressed P
in terms of “marginal” Lagrange multipliers
α(i,yjab ) = y\yjab µ(i,y) , where yjab denotes the subconfiguration of y that matches the local function j on pattern ab. This allows a compact reformulation of an equivalent convex problem that can be solved efficiently as a
compact quadratic program (Taskar et al., 2003). Unfortunately, this approach does not work readily in our case because the Lagrangian (15) does not permit a simple closed
form expression of the dual.
Instead we have to follow a log-barrier approach to solving
this problem (18). Since ∆w ≥ γδ − S is too large to
handle explicitly, an approach must be developed for handling the constraints implicitly. Unfortunately, a direct factorization approach is

Pnot readily available for reducing the
exponential sum in (i,y) log ∆(i, y)w − γδ(i,y) + i .
Nevertheless the constraint generation strategy of (Altun
et al., 2003) can be usefully applied in this case.
To solve (14) in the multivariate case we implemented a

This is in fact an inference problem that can be solved by
conventional methods. For example, if y forms a Markov
chain, then the optimal constraint can be generated by a
Viterbi algorithm run on the probability model defined by
(20).
Once the new constraints have been generated, they are
added to the problem and the solution (w, γ, ) is recomputed using the barrier method. In our experiments we
found this constraint generation scheme to be quite effective, requiring at most 10 to 50 generation iterations to be
executed before solving the problem to within small tolerances.

Experimental results

We implemented this approach and tested it on both synthetic and real data using HMM models for classification,
where the classification variables y play the role of the hidden state sequence, and the input variables x play the role
of the observations. Generally we considered models of the
form depicted in Figure 8, where each y variable has multiple (disjoint) x-children. In our synthetic experiment, we
sampled (x, y) from a sequence of length 5 (5 y variables
with 4 x-children each, for a total of 20 x variables). We
then used a generative model based on the same skewed parameters used in the synthetic single-variable experiments
above; here with β = 0.85. We repeated the experiment
20 times to obtain the final results. Figure 9 shows that
M2 BN again outperforms M3 N and MCL in controlled experiments where the correct Bayesian network structure is
known.
We also conducted an experiment on a protein secondary
structure database (Cuff & Barton, 1999). Here the goal is
to predict the sequence of secondary structure labels given
an observed amino acid sequence. Figure 8 shows the prediction model we used. Basically, the secondary structure
tag yk for a location k in the amino acid sequence is predicted based on a sliding window of 7 adjacent locations,
as well as the neighboring secondary structure tags. We
trained on a subset of the data and tested on 1000 remaining locations disjoint from the training data. The experiment was repeated 20 times. Figure 10 shows that M2 BN
is competitive with M3 N and MCL on this data set.

We have investigated what we feel is a very natural question; whether a Bayesian network representation can be
combined with discriminative training based on the maximum margin criterion of SVMs. We have found that training Bayesian networks under the maximum margin criterion is a hard computational problem—harder than the
standard quadratic program of SVM training. However,
reasonable training algorithms can be devised which optimize the margin exactly in special cases, and provides a
reasonable heuristic in general cases. Our preliminary experiments show that there might be an advantage to respecting the causal model constraints embodied by a Bayesian
network, if indeed these constraints were present during the
data generation. In this sense, maximum margin Bayesian
networks offer a new way to add prior knowledge to SVMs.
The main directions for future research are to improve the
training procedure and add kernels. As in (Taskar et al.,
2003), it is possible to consider adding kernels to our local feature representation. The results of (Altun et al.,
2004) show that it is possible to represent our local functions in terms of weighted combinations of training features. Therefore, one extension we are working on is to
formulate hybrid classifiers with general kernelized potential functions between y and x, but standard conditional
probability tables between classification variables to preserve their causal relationships.
