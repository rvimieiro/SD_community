INTRODUCTION

Dynamic construction of influence diagrams is a powerful
strategy for enabling a computer-based system to match a
human's knowledge. During statistical analysis, the
analyst creates a model of the domain and of the data, so
such dynamic construction is crucial when creating
intelligent systems for statistical analysis. Influence
diagrams are ideal knowledge representations for statistical
models, especially for Bayesian statistical models (Smith

1989). However, the use of Bayesian statistics needs the
end user to direct much of the analysis, because of the

STATISTICAL MODEL

A statistical model comprises elements, interpretations,
and transformations.

Elements of a statistical model

include: probability models, parameters, observations,
and assumptions that allow the analyst to relate tl1e
observations to the parameters.
Interpretations map
elements of the statistical model into inferential concems
in the world.
Transformations are the permitted
operations that change the statistical model, while
maintaining tl1e interpretations of the model.

In the UB m·chitecture, we use influence diagrams
(Howard and Matheson 1981; Oliver and Smith 1990) to
represent the elements of statistical models (Smith 1989).
As generally described, there m-e two classes of o�jects in
these acyclic, directed graphs. Nodes are the objects of
interest: pm-ameters, observations, decision options and
decision objectives.
Note that parameters and
observations m-e continuous quantities, unlike the discrete

A

patient-flow diagram depicts the history of patients in tlle
course of a study and is often published in a report of a

clinical trial. Users manipulate t11e statistical model by

4 METADATA-STATE DIAGRAM: THE
COHORT-STATE DIAGRAM
The metadata-state diagram (MDSD) mediates between the
user's data-driven manipulation of the patient-flow
term refers to knowledge about what sorts of information
are contained in cohorts and in nodes, and what
modifications are permitted.
The MDSD for the
T APRCT problem is called the cohort-state diagram. (see
Fig. 4). The state in this diagram refers to the state of
knowledge regarding a another; implementing that change
of state results in changing the statistical model, as well
as the patient-flow diagram. The diagram aspect of the
MDSD is the set of path traversals permitted. For the
T APRCT problem, it represents, fm' instance, the
methodological knowledge (based on the definition of loss
to followup) that if a statistical model currently reflects
the fact that a cohort of patients has been lost to
followup, then the user's .attempt to provide evidence
about that cohort should be denied; tile traversal fmm state
A to B in Fig. 4 is forbidden.

In summary, a cohort in the patient-flow diagnun points
to a state in the metadata-state diagram. The cohort also
points to study and effective outcome parameters (such as
mortality rates) in the influence diagram (statistical
model). Evidence within a cohort becomes a node in the
influence diagram, dependent on the effective outcome
parameter associated with tile cohort. The relationship
between population outcome parameter and study outcome
parameter reflects domain knowledge.

statistical model. Metadata refers to information about
data (Chytil 1986).
In the UB architecture, this

CONSTRUCTION STEPS

The top-level controlling algorithm works as follows:
The user completes an interaction with the patient-flow
diagram. The patient-flow diagram then translates the
user's metadata directive into a machine-usable format that
includes the metadatum and the target cohort. Unless the
directive signals tetmination of the modeling process, the
system examines the cohort-state diagram to determine
whether tile directive is pennitted, by inspecting the arcs
emanating from the target cohort's state in the diagram. If
the directive is permitted, the system then executes the
corresponding construction step, modifying the patient­
flow diagram and the statistical model in the process. If
new statistical parentless parameters are created by the
construction step, the user is asked to assess prior beliefs
about those parameters; the constructed names of the
parameters are meaningful to the physician user.

Names for new parameters are created by concatenating
phrases associated with transitions in the metadata-state
diagram, modified by knowledge available to the system
regarding the target cohort.
For instance, a new
withdrawal-cohort study outcome parameter will be called

study <outcome> <parameter type> for p atients who
withdrew from therapy in <name of parental cohort>,
where <outcome> might be mortality, <parameter type>

52

might be rate, and <name ofparental cohort> is available
from the patient-flow diagram.

As an example, consider the pseudocode for the
withdraw-transition. There are two major methods
for this object:

corresponding to the construction steps performed on the
patient-flow diagram and on the statistical model,
respectively.

population-level parameter into one that is a deterministic
function of other parameters. Domain knowledge in

IMPLEMENTATION

The architecture presented here has been implemented in a
system called THOMAS (Lehmann 1991), that focuses
on problems of intemal validity in TAPRCT studies. The
int1uence diagrams are restricted to having one layer of
marginally independent chance nodes whose pdfs are beta
distributions. All other nodes are deterministic or
evidential. Evidence nodes have only one parent. The
construction steps are modules whose statistical
components are based on the methodological models of
Eddy, et al. (Eddy, Hasselblad et al. 1991).

)

Two new cohorts ru·e created, with differing semantics as
regards the withdrawal status of patients in those cohorts.
The cohorts are then incorporated into the patient-now
diagram. Finally, an element of domain knowledge is
included, that withdrawn patients effectively receive
baseline care.

Here, the mtxmg model of Fig. 3 is created. The
parameters here are all at the srunple level; the functions

The primary outputs are posterior distributions for the
parameters of the model, and expected utility (life
expectancy). The algorithm for calculating posterior
probabilities uses posterior-mode detetmination, based on
modified Newton-Raphson steepest descent (Shachter
1990), using the approach of Berndt and colleagues
(Berndt, Hall et al. 1974). This algorithm requires matrix
inversion, an 0(m3) process, where m is the number of
parameters with no parents. In our use of this algorithm,
parameters that are functionally identical to other
parameters are eliminated from the model in O(n) time
prior to the posterior-mode determination, where n is the
number of statistical parameters. Thus, the overhead of
maintaining the influence-diagrrun levels takes little away
from the performance of the algoritlun.

Calculation of expected utility is through unidimensional
integration.

THOMAS is implemented on a Macintosh II computer.
The patient-flow diagram was written in HyperTalk and
the remainder of the system was written in Macintosh
Common Lisp, using the Cmnmon Lisp Object System
to house the various objects in the UB architecture.
Communication between the t wo systems used
TalkToMe, a precursor to AppleEvents.

A number of different MDSDs and different patient-flow
diagrams were tested in this architecture. In each
experiment, and as desired, modifications of a major
structure did not require changes in the other structure.

OTHER WORK

This work reflects on research in the AI-and-stati�tics
community, in the biostatistical community, and in the
AI-and-uncertainty community. Statisticians applying AI
In the biostatistical community, Hasselblad and Eddy have
developed the F AST*PRO program (associated wit11
(Eddy, Hasselblad et al. 1991)) to allow medical
researchers construct influence diagrams that represent
statistical models. Differences with our work include their
focus on the data-driven direction of influence-diagram
construction and their lack of a semantic inte1face.

Finally, various researchers of AI and uncertainty have
built systems that automatically build influence diagrams.
Goldman and Chamiak (Goldman and Chamiak 1990)
have developed a language for constructing influence
diagrams, specifically for the domain of natural-language
processing. Their system uses a hienu·chical and typed
influence diagram, as we do; their construction algorithm
is more model-driven than is ours. Similarly, Breese
(Breese 1987) has built a system that constructs influence
diagrams out of modular components. However,

CONCLUSION

We have presented an architecture for creating tools that
allow end users to interpret t11e results of scientific studies
whose data requires statistical analysis for interpretation.
This architecture implements the general decision-analytic
approach to scientific inference presented by Lehmann
(Lehmann 1990). We believe that this architecture could
be extended for other data-analysis problems.
For

instance, for crossover studies, where patients are first
given one, then anot11er treatment, the MDSD and the
patient-flow diagram would both have to be modified.
Furthermore, t11e m·chitecture could be extended to account
for other methodological concerns.
For instance,
randomization is a key consideration whose goal is to

54

Lehmann and Shachter

assure similarity of treatment groups. This concern can
be represented at the sample level in tenus of relative
occurrences of covariate states for study subjects in every
treatment ann, and in tenns of their relative contributions.
Even more generally, we might imagine that this
architecture would be suitable for other AI domains where
the primary user (or even knowledge engineer) may wish
to be protected from details of Bayesian modeling. Thus,
in a vision system, the cognate of the patient-flow
diagram might be the hierarchy of visual perception that
Levitt and colleagues (Binford, Levitt et al. 1987) have
put to such good use, while the MDSD might represent
pennitted, meaningful sequences of visual processing.
Each limb of transition in that process would have
implications for the underlying influence diagram as well
as for an interface that a user would face.

In each case, there are several tasks for the knowledge
engineer. First, he must decide the propriety of the
architecture. Second, from observation of users, he must
decide on the appropriate semantic metaphor and on tl1e
central object of manipulation. Third, from discussions
with domain experts, he must encode the rules for
transitions. Finally, he must figure out what influence
diagram structures and transformations embody the
experts' intentions. This overall construction task is far
from being automated.
In summary, statisticians confront the same problem that
Al-system designers do: How should valid inferences be
made from real-world data? The user-bao;;ed architecture can
be of service to both these communities.
