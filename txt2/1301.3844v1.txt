feasible, or financially worthwhile. Observational data are
passively observed. Such data are more readily available
than experimental data, and indeed, most databases are
observational. Researchers have developed methods for
causal modeling and discovery from observational data that
are an unbiased sample from cases generated by a causal
process of interest (Cooper and Herskovits 1992; Spirtes,
et al. 1993; Heckerman, et al. 1995; Pearl 2000).

Not infrequently, however, observational data consists of a
biased sample of the cases generated by the causal process
of interest. The samples appear in a dataset due to some
selection criteria or effect. Such a sample1 is said to be
subject to
As one example, a robot can
only directly sample the terrain it can physically explore,
which may not be representative of the entire terrain of
interest. As another example, patients who come to an
emergency room may not be representative (in all
important ways) of patients in the entire population of
interest2. Indeed, selection bias has been demonstrated
empirically in several areas of medicine, as for example in
(Gerber, et al. 1982). Nonetheless, we would like to use
data collected in a given setting to induce causal
relationships for that setting as well as for the broader
population. This paper describes a method for modeling
causal relationships under selection. Such modeling can be
applied in performing causal discovery.

selection bias.

The concept of selection bias is well known (Sackett
1979). The idea of using a variable to represent selection
is described in (Wermuth, et al. 1994). In (Spirtes, et al.
1993, Section 9.3) researchers discuss causal modeling
from observational data when a population is sampled
according to some particular selection criteria (e.g., all
patients above a certain weight). Their approach
distinguishes among causal models by using tests of
conditional independence, rather than by using a Bayesian
approach. In (Cooper 1995), numerous conditions under
which causal structure and parameters can (and cannot) be
learned from conditional-independence tests are described,
when there is selection; a special-case Bayesian analysis of
causal modeling under selection also is proposed. A
general algorithm for causal discovery using conditional
independence tests is developed in (Spirtes, et al. 1995).
The unique contribution of the current paper is to describe
a general Bayesian method for causal modeling and
discovery under selection.

Throughout the paper we use as synonyms the nouns

sample and selection, the verbs sample and select, and the
terms sampled and selected.
2 In this paper, the term population of interest means a .set
of cases obtained by unbiased sampling from the cases
generated by a causal process of interest. We use the term
total population synonymously with population of interest.

BACKGROUND

causal network

A causal Bayesian network (or
for short) is
a Bayesian network in which each arc is interpreted as a
direct causal influence between a parent node (variable) and
a child node, relative to the other nodes in the network
(Pearl 1988). Figure 1 illustrates a hypothetical causal
network structure, which contains five nodes. The
probabilities (parameters) that are associated with this
causal network structure are not shown.

fatigue.

The causal Markov condition gives the conditional
independence relationships that are specified by a causal
network:

A node is independent of its non-descendants (i.e.,
non-effects) given its parents (i.e., its direct causes).
The causal Markov condition permits the joint
distribution of the variables in a causal network to be
factored as follows (Pearl 1988):

continuous variables and integration will be obvious.

A
denotes a set of values, one value for each variable
in
A case can be either measured (all values known),
unmeasured (no values known), or partially measured
(some values known). In this paper, we assume there is an
underlying causal process that is generating cases that
constitute the population of interest. We use C to denote
all the cases in the population of interest, regardless of
whether those cases are measured, unmeasured, partially
measured, or some combination thereof.

Assumption
M

1. The cases C were generated by random
sampling from the distribution of a causal network B with
structure and parameters (}M·
We will use Cr to denote the sampled cases and CF to
denote the unsampled cases. Set C is the union of Cr and
C F· Although by Assumption 1 we assume that C was
generated by random sampling from the distribution
defined by B, in general this does not imply that each of
C T and C F are themselves random samples from the
distribution defined by B. In general, they will not be.

Assumption

2. Case selection is a causal event that can be
modeled within a causal network that has a variable
representing whether a case was selected.
To represent selection, we introduce a variable called S
into model
that has states T and F, which designate
whether a given case was sampled (7) or not (F) (Cooper
1995). Let the term
designate all the
variables in

denote all the variables i n
excluding S. We
will use to denote the number of domain variables in
In each case in C r, variable
has the value T,
representing that the case was sampled. In each case in
CF, variable has the value F, denoting that it was not
sampled. Thus, S never has a missing value, because we
know that a case either was or was not sampled.

principle, however, X4 might have had the value F in
some of the selected cases, because it is possible that the
clinic would see a few people without fatigue. Most of the
unselected cases do not have fatigue, but note that one
does; in general, we do not expect that all cases in the
population that are prone to being sampled will in fact be
sampled.

The appeal of Equation 1 is that it expresses the marginal

sum of marginal likelihoods on the total population of
cases. This is useful because researchers previously have
developed methods for deriving the marginal likelihood on
the total population of cases, which is not subject to
selection (Cooper and Herskovits 1992, Geiger and
Heckerman 1994, Heckerman, et al. 1995).

we condition on S in B ', then in general X2 and X3 will
be dependent, because they are d-connected (Pearl 1988).
The selected population involves conditioning on S T.
Thus, in the selected population, X2 and X3 will likely be
dependent, although they have no causal relationship
between them

causal relationships for the selected population, we first
need to estimate those relationships for the total

3.2 EXTENSIONS TO THE BASIC MODEL

As a generalization, suppose some modeled variables are
latent, and thus, they have no measurements, even in the
selected cases. In the example, if Xi were a latent variable,
then the first row of Table 2 would contain all question
marks. To derive the marginal likelihood of data
we
can modify Equation 2 to include an additional inner sum
that sums over the values of the latent variables for the

As another extension, consider multiple forms of case
selection. If sets of cases were selected based on different
criteria, then we simply need to create values for S that
designate which selection criterion was used for each set of
cases. Equation 2 will remain applicable. The following
example illustrates the basic idea.

We close this section with two relatively subtle, but
important points. Set
does not need to contain the
entire population of interest (e.g., the entire county), but
only an unbiased subset that includes the sampled cases
(e.g., the town). Thus, if the town population is a random
sample of the county population, defining as the town
population is sufficient for deriving an unbiased marginal
likelihood using Equation 2. Clearly less computation
will be required when the number of unselected cases is
fewer. The key condition is that be an unbiased sample
from the distribution defined by the generating causal
network of interest.

It may seem that if we are content to learn only about
causal relationships for the sampled population, then we
need not be concerned with modeling the unsampled
population. Unfortunately, this is not so. The reason is
that all causal network learning (of which we are aware)
assumes a random sample from the joint distribution
defined by B. The selected cases for which we have data are
not a random sample. The following simple example
illustrates the problem. Remove node Xi from Figure 2,

For simplicity, in the example we assume that no one
goes to both the fatigue clinic and the smoking clinic. To

handle such a situation, we can create an additional

cases that appear in both the subpopulations.

So far, we have only discussed examples in which S is a
child of one or more domain variables. However, S could
also be a parent of some domain variables, if the selection
event can causally influence the domain variables. For
example, consider that the selected population consists
just of people who visit the smoking clinic. Some of
them may feel less fatigued than similar people in the
entire population, because psychologically these smokers
feel good about making an effort to improve their health
by going to the smoking clinic. Thus, there would be an

APPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL

In this section, we briefly describe how we can apply the
method in Section 3 for causal modeling under selection
when using a convenience sample and when using case­
control data.

convenience sample

A
is a dataset that is collected because
it is available, not necessarily because it is representative
of the population of interest. Case-series reports in
medicine are one type of convenience sample. The fatigue­
clinic example in Section 3 involves a convenience

4

To handle the situation in which selection is also based

on fatigue, we would need to add a temporal dimension to
the model, in order to avoid directed cycles. We do not
pursue that detail here, but only note that in modeling more
complex, real-world events, temporal modeling will often

come into play (see Section 6).

In case-control studies, which are common in medical
research, an investigator identifies
people with a given
condition (the cases) and
people without the condition
(the controls). Often the condition is a disease, and the
task is to discover the factors that causally contribute to
having the disease. To model case-control studies, we can
apply the method in Section 3 that involves using three
values for S, namely the values

distributed to a random sample of the population of
interest. The people who complete and return the survey
are a convenience sample. Arguably, most observational
databases are convenience samples, at least to some
extent. That is, few observational databases appear to
represent a truly random sample of the entire population
of cases that were generated by the causal process of
interest. We can model with a convenience sample by
using values T (selected) and F (unselected) for variable S,
as in Section 3. For some modeling tasks, we may know
the domain variables that influence selection. Thus, we
need not search over models that contain different parents
of S. In other situations, such search may be required;
doing so would indicate the most likely causes of
selection.

under selection. Thus, for a given structure and database
inference under selection also is NP-hard.

et al. 1995)5. For example, the class of models that use
multinomial distributions with Dirichlet priors satisfy
these conditions (Heckerman, et al. 1995). Using such a
class, suppose S and its ancestors form a tree, that is, each
internal node has one parent. We can apply Bayes rule to
the prior parameters on B in order to reverse all arcs away
from S (Shachter 1989), yielding a tree with the same
connectivity, but no arcs into S. All trees with the same
connectivity are Markov equivalent. We are assuming a
model class in which Markov equivalence implies
likelihood equivalence. By likelihood equivalence, the
marginal likelihood for the transformed causal network
will be the same as that of the original network. Figure 4a
shows an example, where the cloud denotes an arbitrary
causal subnetwork. In that figure, and its three ancestors

By reversing the arcs in that tree away from we create
the network in Figure 4b that is Markov equivalent to the

applying the line of reasoning above for when

that this mathematical transformation does not change the

LEARNING FROM A MIXTURE
OF TYPES OF DATA

In this section, we describe how to model causal
relationships when there are observational and
experimental data, some of which are sampled under
selection and some of which are sampled randomly from
the population of interest.

Cob

could reverse arcs (Shachter 1989) away from S anyway,
thereby creating a network in which S is a root node. We
then can derive
K) without summation. There
are, however, at least two problems with this approach.
First, based on the line of reasoning in the proof of
Theorem 1, it follows that the reversal task is NP-hard,
and thus, quite likely intractable in the worst cases.
Second, for non-tree-structured ancestors of S, the arc­
reversal method will generate a Bayesian network that
contains more parameters than the original network.
Therefore, in general the marginal likelihood of the
reversed network structure will not equal the marginal
likelihood of the original network structure.

that indicates a non-experimental case that is
simply observed (see (Cooper and Yoo 1999) for details).
Qx represents the value to which the experimenter intended
to manipulate X. Ideally, Qx has no parents (and thus, its
value is randomly set) and it deterministically controls X.
That ideal may not be realized. As an example of
imperfect control, a patient might initially agree to be in a
study and to take a medication, but later refuse to take it
reliably. If a case is not part of an experiment to
manipulate X, then as stated, Qx
. By introducing Qx
variables, we transform learning with a mixture of
experimental data and observational data into learning with
observational data alone, since Q x is just another
observation (Cooper and Yoo 1999).

As a heuristic patch, we might approximate the marginal
likelihood by using a measure like the BIC score (Geiger,
et al. 1996) that contains a likelihood term that represents
how well the model predicts the data and another term that
represents the number of model parameters. The reversed
model could be used to derive the likelihood term (e.g.,

Figure 6 shows a causal network structure, which has a

3. As in that section, this model represents a

the generating network B. In Figure 6, variable X
is modeled as being experimentally
manipulated in some cases. X4

sole domain variable directly influencing case selection.

By using temporal causal networks (Dean and Kanazawa
1988) we can represent more complex types of data
mixtures in which selection and experimentation occur
over time. For example, at time
a set of cases is
selected according to some criteria (e.g., patients who
arrive at a medical clinic during a given period). We
represent this initial selection process as S to

We further assume that those experimental and
observational cases were randomly sampled from the total
population of nine cases. Taking a random sample of cases
might of course select some patients who also attended the
fatigue clinic. Therefore, in Table 4 the value S

medicine for data to have a history as complex (or more
complex) as the one in this example. The methods in this
paper provide a basis for modeling both simple and
complex forms of selection.
SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK

This paper focuses on how to model causal processes
using data that are obtained under selection. By developing
a general model, it hopefully provides a useful foundation
for further investigation. Key issues yet to be explored
include the conditions under which causal network
structure can be identified from data obtained under
selection (possibly in combination with other types of
data). Also, to attain computational tractability, it will be
important to explore and characterize (both theoretically
and empirically) approximations to the exact method
described here. The usefulness of the model and its
implementation will of course ultimately rest on how
well they help us perform causal modeling and discovery
with real data.
