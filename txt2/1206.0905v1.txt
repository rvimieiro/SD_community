domains in which the kind of linguistically intensive approaches explored in MUC are
difficult or unnecessary. Many documents from this realm, including email, Usenet
posts, and Web pages, rely on extra-linguistic structures, such as HTML tags,
document formatting, and ungrammatical stereotypic language, to convey essential
information. Much recent work in IE, therefore, has focused on learning approaches
that do not require linguistic information, but that can exploit other kinds of
regularities. To this end, several distinct rule-learning algorithms [26, 19, and 9] and
multi-strategy approaches [7] have been shown to be effective. Recently, statistical
approaches using hidden Markov models have achieved high performance levels [28,
10, and 8].
At the same time, work on information integration [1, 11] has led to a need for
specialized wrapper procedures for extracting structured information from databaselike Web pages. Recent research [21, 20, 2, and 12] has shown that wrappers can be
automatically learned for many kinds of highly regular documents, such as Web pages
generated by CGI scripts. These wrapper induction techniques learn simple but highly
accurate contextual patterns, such as “to retrieve a URL, extract the text between “<A
href=" and ">”. Wrapper induction is harder for pages with complicated content or
less rigidly structured formatting, but recent algorithms [2, 12] can discover small sets
of such patterns that are highly effective at handling such complications in many
domains.
In this paper, we demonstrate that our fuzzy approach can be used to perform
extraction in traditional (natural text) domains. We describe fuzzy approach, a
trainable IE system that performs information extraction in both traditional (natural
text) and wrapper (machine-generated or rigidly structured text) domains. Fuzzy
approach learns extraction rules composed only of simple contextual patterns.
Extraction is triggered by specific token sequences preceding and following the start
or end of a target field.

2 Information Extraction
Past work has focused mainly on the construction and learning of the extraction rule.
The rule must be applicable to several fields while making few errors and extracting
the maximum of relevant information in the document or web page. However,
documents such as web pages are semi structured and present several anomalies. Any
particular field in a web page may present a varying structure as well as a variant
context. Hence, it is difficult to construct a perfect rule that satisfies all conditions.
The construction of a complex rule or the adoption of a complex learning algorithm
does not resolve the difficulty. The approach we propose uses a simple extraction rule
that targets a single field. This has enabled us to design a reasonable simple learning
algorithm. The extraction rule exploits the expressive power of fuzzy algebra to

accommodate variant anomalies that may be present in the field, which make our
approach extremely flexible.
An extraction mask is a procedure that extracts useful information (in response to a
user request) contained in a given document. The extracted information is then
produced in a structured format defined by the mask. The mask shows useful
information, i.e. useless information is hidden from the user.
Several approaches have been proposed to help construct extraction masks. Some
are completely manual, while others are automatic or semi automatic (N.Ashish, C.
Knob lock., 1997).
Manual approaches to mask construction describe the web structure with
grammars. This approach requires expert intervention to design the appropriate
grammar as well as to maintain the mask when the structure of the information source
changes.
For semi automatic approaches the user instructs the system, via an interface,
which information fields to extract.
The system then constructs the adequate
mask. These approaches do not require the intervention of an expert. However, any
change in the structure of the information source implies user intervention. Our
approach is semi automatic and generates masks by induction.
Automatic approaches employ learning techniques based on the use of heuristics,
case based reasoning, etc.
Inductive learning algorithms proceeds either bottom-up (generalisation) or topdown (specialisation) (D. Freitag, N. Kushmerick, 2000). A bottom-up approach starts
by selecting one or several examples and constructing a hypothesis to cover them.
Next, it tries to generalise the hypothesis to cover the rest of the examples. On the
other hand, a top-down approach starts with a general hypothesis and then tries to
refine it to cover all positive examples and none of the negative examples.
The information extraction is a complex process. It consists both of a learning task
and an extraction task. Most IE systems have the architecture given in Figure 1.

In general, a web page is composed of a sequence of tokens. A token may take the
form of a simple character, an html tag, a string of digits, etc.
A Web page consists of three main zones: a global zone, a record zone, and an
attribute zone. The global zone contains the various tuples of the page. The record
zone consists of the tuple to extract. The attribute zone is the text fragment sought
and is encapsulated in the tuple (see Figure 2).

A zone is marked by a Begin Separator of the zone and an End Separator of the
zone. A separator is composed of two token sequences, DetectorL and DetectorR.
Each sequence is called Detector. Figure 3 illustrates the structure of a zone.

3 Related works
Four of the most popular wrappers for information extraction are WIEN (Wrapper
Induction Environment) (N.Kushmerick., 1997; and N.Kushmerick, D.Weld,
R.Doorenbos. 1997), BWI (Boosted Wrapper Induction) (D. Freitag, N. Kushmerick,
2000), WHISK (S. Soderland. 1996; S. Soderland. 1999), and SoftMealy (C. Hsu and
M. Dung., 1998; C-N.Hsu, 1998).
WIEN (D. Freitag, N. Kushmerick, 2000; N.Kushmerick., 1997; and
N.Kushmerick, D.Weld, R.Doorenbos. 1997) is a wrapper which automatically
constructs masks based on a user supplied web page examples. WIEN is capable of
information extraction from web pages having an array format.
Several classes of masks have been designed enabling the extraction of the various
tuples that are present in a web page. A mask is composed of couples of strings
delimiting the attributes of a tuple. Hence, each attribute containing the desired text
fragment is delimited by a left delimiter and a right delimiter. The mask induction
algorithm repetitively generates an extraction mask and tests it on the user supplied
examples until it finds a mask that covers all the examples.
The extraction process consists of locating for each attribute its left and right
delimiters and extracting the information between the two delimiters.
BWI (D. Freitag, N. Kushmerick, 2000; D. Freitag., 1998; D. Freitag., 2000) is a
mono-attribute trainable information extraction system. The extraction algorithm
learns separately two sets of boundary detectors: a set F to detect the start boundaries
of the desired attribute and a set A to detect the end boundaries of the attribute. The
learning attribute associates with each learned detector a confidence value, which is a
function of the number of examples correctly covered and the number of miscovered
examples. The confidence values are used to compute a weight for each example. The
weights allow the definition of the learning rate of the supplied examples. Then,
examples with low weights are considered not well learned and are given preferential
treatment over examples with large weights, which are considered well learned.
Extraction consists of seeking begin and end separators with an error below a given
minimum error.
WHISK (S. Soderland. 1996; S. Soderland. 1999) is designed to handle text styles
ranging from highly structured to free text, including text that is neither rigidly
formatted nor composed of grammatical sentences. Such semi-structured text has
largely been beyond the scope of previous systems. When used in conjunction with a
syntactic analyzer and semantic tagging, WHISK can also handle extraction from free
text such as news stories.
SoftMealy (C. Hsu and M. Dung., 1998; C-N.Hsu, 1998) is a multi-attribute
extraction system based on a new formalism of mask representation. This
representation is based on a Finite-State Transducer (FST) and contextual rules,
which allow a wrapper to wrap semi-structured Web pages with missing attributes,
multiple attribute values, variant attribute permutations, exceptions, and typos. The
nodes (states) of the FST model the zones of the Web page and the transitions the
possible zone separators. The FST in SoftMealy takes a sequence of the separators
rather than the raw HTML string as input. Each distinct attribute permutation in the
Web page can be encoded as a successful path and the state transitions are determined

by matching contextual rules that describes the context delimiting two adjacent
attributes.

4 A new fuzzy wrapper for Information Extraction
The solution we propose is based on a new formalism for rule extraction and uses
the expressive power of fuzzy logic during the process of extraction.
Similar to the SoftMealy wrapper, before we start the extraction of the tuples, we
segment an input HTML string into tokens. A token is denoted as t(v) where t is a
token class and v is a string. For example, to the html tags “<I>” and “<B>”
correspond the tokens Html (<I>) and Html (<B>), and to the numeric string “123”
correspond the token Num (123). Below are the token classes and their examples.

Our wrapper is capable to learn how to extract structure information from web
resources on the basis of user supplied examples. It is based on inductive learning
techniques as well as fuzzy logic rules. This approach is composed of three modules:
a page labelling module, a learning module, and an extraction module.
The first module is the page labelling one. The main task of this module is the
specification of the Web page architecture. It indicates the beginning and end of each
zone in the page. The module interacts with the user for the specification of the zone
boundaries. This module accepts as input a Web page and produces as output a series
of labels.

The learning module takes as input a web page and its labels and constructs
extraction rules for each zone. The learning of a zone consists of the determination of
the extraction rule that will recognize the two separators at the beginning and end of
each zone.
To recognize the separator at the beginning or end of a zone, we must identify the
pertinent tokens among the token sequence to the left of the separator (DetectorL) and
those to its right (DetectorR).
The learning step consists of determining in the token sequence the positions of the
pertinent tokens and their occurrences over a distance MoyL, which is the tuple
average length. Then, for each detector we determine a frequency matrix F where,
f (i, j ) represents the number of occurrences of token j at distance i.
Next, we estimate the cost of each detector. The cost metric is used to estimate the
error made by a detector that is learned as opposed to a detector that is extracted. This
metric should be a function of the token positions and their occurrences.
Let P and O be, respectively, the set of the positions and the occurrences of learned
tokens. To estimate the cost of a token, we define the following two functions:
f Pj : Ν → [0,1] : is a function characterizing the degree of truth of the position of
the token j with respect to its separator (distance), defined as follows (see Figure 6):

 f Pj (i ) = 1
if

j
0 ≤ f P (i ) < 1 if

f (i, j ) > 0

.

(1)

f (i , j ) = 0

f Oj : Ν → [0,1] : is a function characterizing the degree of truth of the occurrence
of the token j. It is defined as follows:
 j
 fO(i) =

number of

 f j (i) =
O

number of

f (i, j)

if

f (i, j) > 0

learned instances
f (i', j)

.

(2)

ifi f (i, j) = 0

learned instances

With i ' is the nearest position of i such as f (i, j ) > 0 .
The cost of a token and the cost of a detector are defined as follows:

Cost token (distance) = f Ptoken (distance) . f Otoken (distance) .

Cost detector =

(3)

moyL

∑ Cost
i =1

token

(i )

(4)

Then, while parsing the web pages, we associate with each zone detector the
minimum cost of the encountered detector C min , the maximum cost Cmax , and the
average cost,

C moy =

C min + C max
.
2

(5)

degree of truth

These cost metrics will serve during the following extraction stage.
The third module is the extraction module consists of extracting the different tuples
contained in a Web page.
To extract the different tuples a Web page, we proceed in three steps. First, we
extract the global zone of the page. Next, the various records contained in the global
zone are extracted. Finally, for each record, we extract the different attributes it
contains to construct the corresponding tuple. This way, all tuples of the page are
extracted.

The extraction of a zone is done via the determination of the two separators of the
beginning and end of the zone. The determination of a separator is achieved by means
of its two detectors. Indeed, the separator we seek is the one whose two detectors
commit minimal cost errors (less than a threshold) in comparison to the costs of the
detectors learned during the learning stage.

Cost Detector = Cost Detector − Cmoy

(6)

ErrorSeparator = ErrorDetectorL + ErrorDetectorR

(7)

.

To determine the error that a separator commits from the errors committed by its
detectors DetectorL and DetectorR, we apply the following fuzzy logic rules.

if ErrorLeft is positiveSmall or ( ErrorRight is positiveSmall) then ErrorTot
is positiveSmall.
if ErrorLeft is positive or ( ErrorRight is positive) then ErrorTot is positive.
if ErrorRight is zero and ( ErrortLeft is zero ) then ErrorTot is zero.
if ErrorLeft is negativeSmall or ( ErrorRight is negativeSmall) then ErrorTot
is negativeSmall.
if ErrorLeft is negative or (ErrorRight is negative) then ErrorTot is negative.

5 Exemple
Let’s consider web pages listing country names and codes (Figure 5). Each tuple
consists of a country name and its corresponding telephone code. To label a Web
page, we use an interface that allows a user to specify for each zone the starting and
ending characters of the zone.

<HTML><TITLE>Some Country
Codes</TITLE>
<BODY><B>Some Country
Codes</B><P>
<B>Congo</B> <I>242</I><BR>
<B>Egypt</B> <I>20</I><BR>

Fig. 5. Labelling of a Web page.

The learning module accepts as input a sequence of couples (Web Page, Label). In
this example, we used three pages and, therefore, the learning module is given three
couples. Then, the information extraction system builds for each detector a frequency
matrix. For the Web page example of Figure 5, the frequency matrix obtained after
the learning of DetectorL of the separator of the start of the global zone is given in
Table 1.
For example, FrequencyL(4,1) = 3 means that the token C1Alph has been observed
in three pages at position 4 in DetectorL. Then we compute for each detector the
corresponding costs, C min ,
of the costs of its tokens.

Cmax et Cmoy . The cost of a detector is equal to the sum

To compute the cost of the token C1Alph, we look at the first column of matrix

Then the costs corresponding to the token C1Alph are,

C C1Alph (4) = 1 * 3 / 3 = 1

C C1Alph (3) = 0.5 * 3 / 3 = 0.5
and the cost of the detector is,

C détecteur = C C1Alph (4) + C C1Alph (3) + C Lst (2) + C HTML
= 1 * 3 / 3 + 0.5 * 3 / 3 + 0.66 * 2 / 3 + 1 * 1 / 3
= 2.26

Experimental results

We compared performances of our approach to those of SoftMealy. We considered
five collections of Web pages that present different types of anomalies and attempted
to extract from each page the different tuples it contains.
The results are summarised in Table 2 below. We compare our approach with
SoftMealy, since only the code of SoftMealy was available to us. The comparison is
performed with respect to the Recall Coefficient and Precision performance metrics,
which are defined as follows:

We notice that, with regard to the recall coefficient, the two curves corresponding

the fact that processes of training are the same in the two approaches. However, figure
7 and 8 clearly illustrate that the recall coefficient of our approach is always superior
to the recall coefficient reached by SoftMealy and the gap between the two
approaches is more and more important when the number of test pages increases.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a new approach to information extraction from multiattribute semi-structured Web pages. Our approach is flexible in the sense that it
tolerates the existence of variant anomalies in the pages such as, missing attributes,
permutation of attributes, etc. The flexibility is achieved by following a fuzzy
inductive learning approach. The user can intervene at any moment to improve the
rules learned by adding new training examples. Both the information extraction and
learning algorithms are independent of the lexical analyser. Experimental results
obtained on several test Web pages show a superior performance of our approach
compared to that of SoftMealy with respect to Recall Coefficient and Precision
metrics.
The basis on which we worked is characterized by different exceptions.
SoftMealy, for example, is very dependent of the training whole. Indeed, transitions
of the automaton are very dependent on what is observed during the training. The
function of generalization used in SoftMealy permits no mistake of positions for
tokens. It doesn't hold amount of the token occurrence in the whole of training. So, a
transition remains rigid enough even though it is constituted of several under rules.
To determine the beginning and the end of a zone, our approach uses the
committed mistake. It permits to assign a mistake to the observed processes during
the training. It permits to detect, as SoftMealy, the different permutations of
attributes. The resemblance of our approach with SoftMealy is to the level of the
exploitation of the same architecture of a Web page during the phase of extraction.
