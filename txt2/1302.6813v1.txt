bility measures was first given in [Dubois 86), where
it was established a formal relation between possibil­
ity theory and qualitative possibility relations. Since
then several logics of qualitative possibility have been
proposed to allow specifying partial qualitative pos­
sibility relations and deriving consequences based on
this partial information. Farinas and Herzig [Farinas &
Herzig, 91] axiomatize the logic of qualitative possibil­
ity called QP L, introducing a conditional connective
2:, and they relate it to the Lewis' conditional logic
V N. They also propose a multi-modal logic based
on sphere semantics to fully support possibility the­
ory. Boutilier presents in [Boutilier, 92] a possible
worlds semantics for qualitative possibility relations
and defines two modal logics, co and co·, and he
makes use of two modalities to capture possibilistic
logic. One corresponds as usual to truth at acces­
sible worlds while the other to truth to inaccessible
worlds. Finally, in [Bendova & Hajek, 93] qualitative
possibilistic logic is related to a tense logic with finite
linearly preordered time called F LPOT, pushing fur­
ther some aspects of the previous works, specially the
incompleteness of Q P L and the ptecise relation of the
above modal systems with unary modalities to QPL.
It is also worth noticing that similar attempts of re­
lating other quantitative and qualitative uncertainty
measures have been proposed in the literature. See for
instance [Segerberg, 71] or [Bacchus, 90] for the case
of probability measures or [Harmanec & Hajek, 94],
[Resconi, Klir & St. Clair, 92] for belief and plausibil­
ity measures. See also [Wong et a!., 91].
On the other hand, vagueness (fuzziness) concerns de­
grees of truth, usually numerical, and therefore one
is led to many-valued logics as underlying formalism.
In this sense, fuzzy logic deals with fuzzy propositions
that may have intermediate degrees of truth and it is
usually understood as truth-functional, i.e. the truth
degree of a compound formula is a function of the truth
degrees of its subformulas using suitable connectives.
Because of this key feature, fuzzy logic departs from
any uncertainty logic.
So far, as argued elsewhere ([Godo & Mantaras, 93],
[Hajek, 93], [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]), we have
seen that qualitative uncertainty (possibility) leads to

On Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility in a Fuzzy Setting

modal logics, while fuzziness leads to many-valued log­
ics. Therefore, presence of both fuzziness and uncer­
tainty leads to calculi that are both many-valued and
modal. Modal many-valued logics have been already
investigated by some authors, see for instance [Oster­
mann, 88} or [Fitting, 92}. Our goal is to study logical
systems of qualitative possibility dealing with fuzzy
propositions. It is clear then that the first question
one is faced with is how to compare formulas of fuzzy
logic with respect to their possibility or, more general,
with respect to the possibility measures of worlds on
which they have a given truth-value. This question
has not an unique answer. For instance, in a recent
and very related works [Hajek & Harmancova, 93},
[Hajek, Harmancova & Verbrugge, oo] the possibility
of a fuzzy formula is described by a fuzzy truth-value,
i.e. a function that provides, for each truth-value c:r,
the possibility of the fuzzy formula being a-true. The
corresponding modal calculus QF L of comparison of
possibilities is there shown to have a faithful interpre­
tation in a certain many-valued tense logic (with lin­
early preordered time), and thus naturally extending
the results in [Bendova & Hajek, 93].
In the present paper we investigate qualitative fuzzy
logics based on an alternative definition of possibility
of a fuzzy formula, following the well known Zadeh's
extension of classical possibility measures to fuzzy
propositions (cf. [Zadeh, 78] [Dubois & Prade, 85]).
With this definition, the possibility of a formula of
fuzzy logic is again only one value. Furthermore, in
our setting the possibility of a formula is just a truth
value. To simplify matters, we make the following de­
sign choices: we investigate finitely valued Lukasiewicz
fuzzy logics where the set Values of truth values co­
incides with the set of allowed possibility degrees. We
show that this notion is useful to express statements
about qualitative possibility comparisons. The corre­
sponding comparative logic QF £21 is shown to sat­
isfy reasonable axioms and to be closely related to
the many-valued analogue MV55 of the modal logic
55. In Artificial Intelligence, 55 is often understood
as the logic of knowledge whereas its weakening I< D45
is understood as the logic of belief (cf [Voorbraak, 93},
[Halpern & Moses, 92}). We relate our calculi also
to K D45 and its many-valued counterpart MVKD45.
Completeness theorems for MV55 and MVf{ D45 are
obtained. This is not a too surprising result; [Fit­
ting, 92] has much about completeness of many valued
modal logics and [Ostermann, 88] too. But we present
Hilbert-style systems and get their completeness. Cf.
also [Nakamura, 91a, 91b] for a different approach.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the
underlying many-valued propositional calculus is de­
scribed. In Section 3, possible world semantics for the
qualitative fuzzy logic Q F L2 is introduced, while in
Section 4 we prove its faithful interpretation on the
many-valued modal MV55, also described in this sec1

The subindex 2 distinguishes our logic from the logic

tion. Finally, in Section 5 the logic MVf{ D45 is pre­
sented and proved that Q F L2 can be also faithfully
interpreted there. We end with some concluding re­
marks.

MANY-VALUED
PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS
USED

Fix a natural number n ;?: 2; we base our investigations
over the n-valued propositional Lukasiewicz's logic Ln,
as described e.g. in [Gottwald, 88]. This choice does
not imply that we claim Lukasiewicz's logic be the only
formal logical system for fuzzy logic. Our set of truth
values is Values= {0, 1/(n-1), . . . , 1}. Principal con­
nectives are implication and negation, denoted respec­
tively by-+ and ...,, with Lukasiewicz semantics: ...,A is
interpreted by 1- x and A-+ B by min(l- x + y, 1)
where x , y E Values are the interpretations of A
and B respectively; occasionally we write I(x, y) for
min(l- x + y, 1). Other connectives are defined from
-+and-,, in particular, there are two conjunctions and
two disjunctions. We have the connectives 1\ and V,
interpreted by min(x, y) and max(x, y) respectively,
and & interpreted by max(O, x + y- 1), and its dual
Y... interpreted by min(l, x + y). The equivalence con­
nective +-+ is interpreted by min(I(x, y), l(y, x)). A
complete axiomatization of Ln extends the celebrated
axiomatization of L00 [Rose and Rosser, 58] by some
few additional axioms, namely:
•
•
•
•

(A_, B)-+ ((B-+ C)-+ (A-+ C)),

(A-. (B ___.C)),..... ((A&B ) _,C) and (...,(A_, B)) ......
(A&-,B). Further note the !-tautology (A -> B) ......
( ...,B -+ ..,A). We extend Ln by unary connectives (co­
efficients) (i) for each i E Values; the value of (i)A is
1 iff the value of A is i, otherwise the value of (i)A is
0. In fact the connectives (i) are definable in Ln, see
[Ostermann, 88] or [Gottwald, 88]. Finally notice that
Dienes and Godel's implications are also definable in
Ln as -.A V B and (1)(A-> B) V B respectively.
In the sequel, the constant True will stand forA -> A,
False for -,True, and B0-formulas will be formulas
generated from formulas of the form ( i)A using con­
nectives and coefficients. Clearly, each such a formula

Hajek, Hannancova, Esteva, Garcia, and Godo

is Boolean in the semantic sense: it takes only values
1 and 0. (Later we introduce another class of formulas
that are Boolean). We list next some axioms on formu­
las containing coefficients (cf. [Hajek & Harmancova,
93]); in fact they are provable (by definability of coef­
ficients and completeness of axioms for Ln)·

The corresponding dual notion of necessity can be

The idea behind the above definition is to use it in next
sections to interpret in our comparative logic QF L2
sentences of type B is at least as possible as A, being
A and B many-valued, as II(A) ::; II(B). This inter­
pretation extends to the fuzzy (many-valued) case , in
a different way than QF L, the comparison of possibili­
ties that is present in the qualitative possibilistic logics
QPL, CO and F LPOT mentioned in the introduction
section. However, it is worth noticing that other ways
of extending the notion of possibility for fuzzy propo­
sitions have been also advocated; see [Dubois & Prade,
92] for a discussion of such extensions. Next lemmas
show a characterization of possibility measures II given
by possibilistic Kripke models.
Lemma 3.2 {cf. {Dubois fj Prade, 1988]} For each
possibilistic Kripke model K, II satisfies the following:

(IIl) II(True)

=

II(False)= 0

1,

(II2) II(A VB)= max(II(A), II( B ))

(II3) if Ln f-A+-+ B then II(A) = II(B)

The only deduction rule is modus ponens. This ends
our description of the underlying propositional calcu­
lus.

(II4) II(A) =

Proof" We only prove the last equality.

KRIPKE MODELS,
POSSIBILITIES

Our possibilistic Kripke models over a set Atom of
propositional atoms have the form
[{= (W, lh rr)

where W is a non-empty set of possible worlds, If­
maps Atom x W into Values, 1r maps W into Values
and maxw EW rr ( w) = 1. Recall that we consider possi­
bilities taking values only in Values. We extend If- in
the obvious way to a mapping (denoted again by If-)
of Forma x W into Values where Form0 is the set
of all formulas of our propositional logic satisfying the
usual inductive conditions. We write II A llw= i for
If-(A, w) = i. Concerning satisfiability, we shall write
wlf-A iff I I A llw= 1. (Note II A llw= i i ff wlf-(i)A.)
The corresponding notions of validity and semantical
entailment are the usual ones.
After Zadeh (cf. [Zadeh 1978], [Dubois & Prade, 86)),
we introduce the following notion of the possibility
degree of a {fuzzy) formula A E Form0 in a possibilis­
tic Kripke model, that extends to many-valued propo­
sitions the notion of classical possibility measure for
two-valued propositions which plays a central role in
possibilistic logic.

classical two-valued propositional calculus; it is sound for
boolean formulas but not for all formulas.

satisfies the axioms (II 1- II4) of the preceding lemma
then there is a finite Kripke model f{ such that II is
the possibility given by f{.
Lemma 3.3 Assume the set

Proof" Note that (II4) guarantees that it is enough to
produce a Kripke model f{ whose possibility coincides
with II for B0-formulas. Now it is easily seen that each
B0-formula .is equivalent to a Boolean combination of
formulas of the form (i)p where p is a propositional
atom.
Therefore, we may produce a model f{ in full
'
analogy to the two-valued case: each B0-formula B
is Ln-equivalent to a disjunction of maximal elemen­
tary conjunctions of the form (\7':_1 (j; )p;, where m is
the cardinality of the set Atom, thus for each such B
there is a maximal elementary conjunction C such that
II(B) = II(C). Thus we construct our model from the
•
elementary conjunctions in the usual way.

Notice that, given a possibilistic Kripke model K =
{W, If-, rr) over a set Atom of atoms, if p is a propo­
sitional variable not in Atom, I< clearly determines
uniquely a model I<' = {W, If-') over Atom' = Atom U
{p} such that If-' coincides with If- on Atom and
lf-'(p, w) = rr(w) for each w E W. (K' has no ex­
plicit structure on W .) Models of the form {W, IH

below). If ]{' = (W, It-') is an MVS5-model over
Atom U {p} such that max{ll p llwl w } = 1 then it de­
termines uniquely a possibilistic model I< = (W, lh 1r)
where If- is the restriction of If-' to At om x W and
1r(w) = lf-(p, w) for all w E W. We shall identify /{

In the next section we shall introduce various modal­
ities defined in our Kripke models, among them the
modality of comparison of possibilities.

of investigating the logic of comparison of possibilities,
to axiomatize the D modality. This is our next task.
First, observe that if a formula A is Boolean (takes
only values 0,1) then OA is also Boolean; but of course
OpA need not be Boolean. Define the class of B­
formulas to be the class of formulas resulting from
formulas of the form (i)A, where A is an arbitrary
formula, possibly containing modalities, using connec­
tives. Thus each B-formula is Boolean.

MANY-VALUED LOGIC MVS5

We enrich our language by three modalities, 0, Op and
<lp (for Atom' = AtomU{p}) and define their seman­
tics as follows.
II OA l]w= max{ll A llw'l w' E W};
II OpA llw = max{ll pi\ A llw'l w' E W};
A <lp B is OrA- OpB
the corresponding duals DA, DpA and A -<p B being
defined as· -,0-,A, ....,op...,A and ...,{...,A <lp -.B) respec­
tively.

Note that formulas OA, OpA and A <lp B take a con­
stant value independently of a given wE W. Thus we
shall write from now on II OA I I, II OpA II etc. Next
lemma summarizes properties and relations among the
above modalities; note that we work with models K'
in which max(ll p llwl w) = 1, i.e. II Op II= 1.
Lemma 4.1 The

following properties hold for any

formulas A and B:
(a) II DA II= min{II A llw I wE W}

(b) II OpA II= II(A),
II DpA II = N(A)

{c) OpA is equivalent to O(p A A),
DpA is equivalent to D( ...,p VA)
{d) A -<p B is equivalent to DpA- DPB
(e) II A <l p B I I = 1 iff II (A) ::; II (B),
II A -<p B II= 1 iff N(A) ::; N(B)

Thus it is clear that the modality Op captures the pos­

Theorem 4.3

The proof is standard and sketched at the end of this
section.
Next step is to formally introduce our qualitative
modal logic for comparison of possibilities of fuzzy
propositions, and to faithfully embed it in MVS5
Definition 4.4 The qualitative modal fuzzy logic
QFL2 over a set Atom of atoms has formulas built

up from atoms (propositional variables) using logical
connectives and a binary modality <l; models are pos­
sibilistic models (W, lh rr) and the semantics is

Given a variable p not in Atom, the

The above mapping ** is a faithful in­
terpretation of QFL2 in MVS5, i.e. a formula A of
Q F L2 is a )-tautology iff A"* is a MVS5-tautology.
Proof: Let K = {W, lh 1r) be a rriodel of Q F L2 and let

wlf-(i)A. Then K' = (W, I�') constructed above is a
model of MVS5 and K'lf-'(l)Op, wlf-'(i)A* and hence
wlf-'A**. Thus if A** is a 1-tautology of MVSS, then
A is a 1-tautology of QFL2.

Conversely, let K1 = {W, I�' ) be a MVS5-model (of
the language extended by p). If Kdf-'( < l)Op then
clearly K1lf-'(l)A**; if I<d�'(l)Op then I<1 =I<' for
the obvious I<. If wlf-'(i)A** then wl�'(i)A* and
wlf-(i)A. Thus if A is a 1-tautology of QF L2 then
•
A** is a 1-tautology of MVS5.
In the rest of this section we sketch a proof of the
completeness of MVS5.

cluding all formulas (1)C where Cis MVS5-provable.
T f- C (T proves C) if there is a proof of C from T
using only modus ponens (no necessitation). T is com­

THE LOGIC

Q F L2

(b) (3TRiT0)(Tf-(i)C)

The QF L2 comparative modality <l introduced in the
previous section relies fundamentally on the MVS5
modality <>p. Therefore it seems interesting to inves­
tigate a possible axiomatization of the modality Op
itself, without needing to refer it to any other modal­
ity. To this end, in this section we relate our QF L2 to
a many-valued version of the belief logic K D45 (see
e.g. [Voorbraak]). Our MV/{ D45 will be a subtheory
of MVS5 (like f{ D45 is a subtheory of 55); if there
are only two values (Values= {0, 1}) then MVK D45
becomes K D45 like MV 55 becomes 55. Moreover,
a faithful embedding of QF L2 into MV/{ D45 is very
easy to define.
Models of MV /{ D45 are again possibilistic Kripke
structures /{ :::: (W, 1�, 11'), where 71' is a normalized
possibility distribution on W with values in Values
that can be understood as a many-valued accessibility
relation R defined as R(w, w') = 1r(w' ). Such many­
valued accessibility relations already occur in [Fitting,
92].

This last lemma enables us to define our model as fol­
lows.
For each i and C such that To 1(i)OC let Tc be a theory T as in (b) in the above
lemma. We define the model (W, lh 1r ) such that the
set of worlds is W ={To} U {Tc I C}; forT E W, the
forcing relation is defined by TH-( i)p iff T f- ( i)p, and
finally, the possibility distribution is given by 1r(T) = i
i!JT r E 1\ (i)OE.

more natural choice would be II DA II= minw ( 1r ( w ) )
II A llw) but then to have duality of D and 0 we should
have II OA II= maxw(7r & II A llw) (strict conj u nction).
Unfortunately, for this semantics of D one of the basic
axioms of modal logic, namely D(A -+ B) -+ (DA ->
DB), is not a tautology.

(3) To find an elegant (non-pedestrian) axiomatization
of QF L2 in its own language still remains. As a matter
of fact, it is worth noticing that some of the axioms of
Farinas and Herzig's QP L logic, e.g.

candidates.

that Values is finite and study the full Lukasiewicz's
logic with real values.

Finally, QF L2 is related to MVKD45 in the way next
theorem shows.

(5) The relationship between the semantics of the com­
parative modality in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93] and in
this present paper it is also a matter of future research.

Corollary 5.10 (Completeness)

MVKD45 is
plete with respect to the given semantics.

Define an interpretation of QF L2formulas in MV]{ D45 by putting (A <l B)*
(OA -+ OB) and extending trivially to all QF L2formulas. Then * is a faithful interpretation of QF L2
in M I<V D45, i.e. a QF L2-formula A is a QF L2tautology iff A* is a MV I< D 45-t aut ol o gy.

CONCLUDING REMA RKS AND
FUTURE WORK

In this paper we have investigated, from a logical point
of view, a modality for comparison of possibilities of
fuzzy propositions. In this sense, this paper tackles
the same problem as in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]
but with another approach. Taking as referen ce the
Zadeh's extension of the concept of possibility mea­
sures to fuzzy propositions, the corresponding com­
parative logic QF L2 has been related to two many­
valued modal systems namely MVS5 and MVKD45,
for which complete axiom systems, Hilbert style, h ave
been given. However a number of open questions re­
main for future investigation. Some of them are listed
below.
(1) It would be desirable to replace axioms (1), (2) of
definition 5.6 by some other more elegant axioms (in
particular not dealing explicitly with m.e.c.'s). One
tautology more similar to the axioms of MVS5 is
(;?: i)DC ,..... ( ;?: i )D ( ;?: i)C.

(2) Our choice of semantics of DA in MVKD45 might
seem unnatural:
II DA II= minw((l- 1r(w)) V II A llw)- A seemingly
