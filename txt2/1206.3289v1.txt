dependencies are present among hidden state variables, leading many to search for approximation algorithms [1, 13, 15, 14]. Unfortunately, modeling persistence with DBNs requires the introduction of many
inter-temporal arcs, often making exact inference intractable with standard inference algorithms.
In this paper, we define Persistent Causal DBNs (PCDBNs), a particular class of DBN models capable of
modeling many real-world systems that involve long
chains of causal influence coupled with persistence of
causal effects. We show that a linear time algorithm
exists for inference (smoothing) in linear chain and
tree-based PC-DBNs. We then generalize our results
to polytree causal networks, where the algorithm remains exact, and to general networks, where it inherits properties of loopy belief propagation [21]. Our
method relies on a transformation of the original prototype network, allowing smoothing to be done efficiently; however, this method does not readily deal
with the incremental filtering problem. Nonetheless,
we show empirically that, if evidence is observed at
every time slice, approximate filtering can be accomplished with fixed window smoothing, producing lower
error than approximate Boyen-Koller (BK) filtering [1]

using a fraction of the computation time.
The algorithm that we present exploits a particular type of determinism that is given by the persistence relation. There has been other work that seeks
to directly or indirectly exploit general deterministic
structure in Bayesian networks using compilation approaches [2], a generalized version belief propagation
[10], and variable elimination with algebraic decision
diagrams [3, 19]. These more general methods have
not been tailored to the important special cases of
DBNs and persistency. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to investigate persistency in DBNs.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we
introduce the changepoint transformation. Section 3
introduces persistent causal chain DBNs and the corresponding inference algorithm, which retains all the
essential properties of later models. Then, Section 4
will discuss the steps leading to a fully general algorithm. Experimental results are presented in Section
5, followed by conclusions.

Notation and changepoints

Consider a Bayesian network (BN) with N binary variables Xi ; we will refer to this network as the prototype.
The corresponding Dynamic BN with M slices is created by replicating the prototype M times and connecting some of the variables to their copies in the next
slice. In our notation, upper indices range over time
slices of the DBN; lower indices range over variables
in each time slice. Colon notation is used to denote
sets and sequences. Thus, for instance, X41:M denotes
the entire temporal sequence of values of X4 from time
1 to time M . Variables without an upper index will
refer to their respective counterparts in the prototype.
We say that a variable Xk is persistent if
½
P (Xk |U )
if Xkt−1 = 0
P (Xkt = 1|Xkt−1 , U t ) =
,
1
if Xkt−1 = 1
(1)
where U = P a(Xk ) refers to the parents of Xk in the
prototype. In other words, 1 is an absorbing state.
Sometimes [12] a variable is called persistent if it has
an arc to the next-slice copy of itself. Our definition of
persistence is strictly stronger, but no confusion should
arise in this paper.
There are 2M temporal sequences of values of a binary
variable Xk . If the variable is persistent, the number of
configurations is reduced to M + 1. Information about
Xk1:M can be summarized by looking at the time when
X changed from 0 to 1 (we sometimes refer to the 0
state as the off state and 1 as the on state). Thus,
inference in the persistent DBN with binary variables
is equivalent to inference in a network whose topology closely resembles that of the prototype and whose

variables are M +1-ary discrete changepoint variables,
with correspondingly defined conditional probability
distributions (CPDs), as shown in Figure 1b. The
models in Figure 1a and 1b are identical; one can go
back and forth between them by recognizing that
(X̃ = j) ⇔ (X j = 0) ∧ (X j+1 = 1) and
(X j = 0) ⇔ (X̃ > j).
If the prototype is a tree, belief propagation in the
transformed network yields an algorithm whose complexity is O(M 2 N ). The quadratic part of the computation comes from summing over the M + 1 values
of the single parent for each of the M + 1 values of
the child. Similarly, if the prototype is a polytree,
complexity will be proportional to M Umax +1 , where
Umax is the largest in-degree in the network. This
transformation by itself, when all hidden state variables are persistent, allows us to perform smoothing
much more efficiently than by operating on the original DBN. There is, however, additional structure in
the CPDs that allows us to do better by a factor of M ,
and we can also adapt our algorithm to deal with the
case when some hidden variables are not persistent.

PCC-DBN inference

To simplify the exposition, let us now focus on a specific prototype, a persistent causal chain DBN (PCCDBN). This is a chain with P a(Xi ) = {Xi−1 }, i =
1, ..., N and P a(O) = XN (thus it has N+1 nodes).
Let us further assume that the leaves are nonpersistent and observed, while the causes (X nodes)
are all persistent and hidden. The network is shown
in Figure 1a and its transformed version in Figure 1b.
Consider the problem of computing P (O). This is in
general one of the most difficult inference problems, requiring one to integrate out all hidden state variables,
and is implicit in most inference queries:
P (O1:M ) =

X

1:M
1:M
P (O1:M | X1:N
) · P (X1:N
)

(2)

1:M
X1:N

Let {jk : 0 ≤ jk ≤ M } index the sequence of Xk1:M
in which variable Xkjk is the last (highest-time) variable to be in the off state, unless jk = 0 in which case
it indexes the sequence in which all Xk are in the on
state. As an example, if M = 3, then jk = {0, 1, 2, 3}
indexes the states Xk1:M = {111, 011, 001, 000}, respectively, for all k. All configurations not indexed by ji
have zero probability due to the persistence assumption. To simplify notation, we use jk to denote the
event that Xk1:M is the sequence indexed by jk . We
also say that Xk fired at jk . We can decompose Equa-

refer to X21 as the temporal parent of X22 and to X12
as its causal parent.

In order to calculate Equation 5 in time O(M N ), we
need to pre-compute σ̄kL , σkL and σ̂kL for all values of L
in O(M ) for each variable Xk .

Denote by Pk the probability that variable Xk will fire
for the first time given that its causal parent has fired,
and by Pbk the probability that Xk will fire for the first
time given that its causal parent has not fired:

≡

P (Xkj = 1 | Xkj−1 = 0, Xk−1

Let Pk and Pbk denote the complements 1 − Pk and
1 − Pbk , respectively. We can define ΣL
k recursively
to denote the partial sum over jk from Equation 3,
conditioned on jk−1 = L:
X

Now we now need to show that one can calculate the

entire set Σ0:M

written as follows:
L

ΣL

Upward Recursion Relations

As a boundary condition for the recursion, assume we
have calculated ΣkN +1 for all 0 ≤ k ≤ M . We show
how to do this in time O(M ) in Section 3.2. Also, this
algorithm requires the pre-calculation and caching of
Pbki for 0 ≤ k ≤ N and 0 ≤ i ≤ M , which can be done
recursively in O(M N ) time and space.
Inspecting Equation 7 more closely, it should be easy
i
to see that one can calculate σ̄N
for 0 ≤ i ≤ M in
O(M ) time using the following recursion:
σ̄li+1 = σ̄li + Pbli · Pbl · Σik+1 ,

(10)

with boundary condition σ̄l0 = 0 for all l. One can also
calculate σki for 0 ≤ i ≤ M with the recursion:
σki−1 =

σki
Pk + Pbki−1 · Pk · Σi−1
k+1 ,

(11)

with boundary condition σkM = 0 for all l. Finally, one
i
can calculate σ̂N
for 0 ≤ i ≤ M with the recursion:
σ̂ki−1 =

σ̂ki
Pk
Pb

(12)

k

with boundary condition σ̂kM = PbkM · ΣM
k+1 for all l.

i
Once σ̄N
, σN
and σ̂N
are calculated, one can calculate
i
all ΣN for 0 ≤ i ≤ M in O(M ) time using Equations 10, 11, 12 and 6. After Σ0:M
is calculated, we
N
can use Equation 4 to obtain Σ0:M
N −1 in time O(M ),
and repeat N times to get all values of Σ0:M
1:N . Thus
the entire calculation takes O(M N ) time.

3.2

Computing ΣiN +1

To finalize the proof, we have to show how to calculate ΣiN +1 (the probability of the observations for a
1:M
given configuration i of XN
) for all 0 ≤ i ≤ M in
time O(M ). Recall that ΣiN +1 ≡ P (O1:M | jN = i).
Since the parent of each Oj is given, for each i, this
calculation is simply the product of the observations:
P (O1:M | jN = i) =

M
Y

k
P (Ok | XN
, jN = i)

(13)

k=1

Using our existing notation, we define

ΣiN +1 can be calculated for all 0 ≤ i ≤ M in time
O(M ) via the recursion relation:

Note that this formulation puts no distributional assumption on P (O|XN ). The leaves can be distributed
as multinomials, Gaussians etc, as is often done with
Hidden Markov models [18] when they are put to their
many uses.

Downward Recurrences

The above discussion completes the description of the
“λ-pass” of PCC-DBN algorithm. Similar reasoning
can be applied to obtain the “π-pass” recurrences that
we now give without full derivation. Analogously to
Σ, the semantics of Ψjk is p(Xk = j|Ok+ ), where Ok+ is
the subset of evidence reachable from Xk through its
parent1 . Ψjk is again a sum of three components:
Ψjk = ψkj + ψ̄kj + ψ̂kj

(17)

ψ̄ accounts for the terms where the parent has not yet
changed:
ψ̄k`−1 = ψ̄k` ·

+ Pbk`−1 · Pbk · Ψ`k−1
Pk

(18)

with initialization ψ̄kM = 0 for all k.
ψ accounts for the terms where the parent has already
changed:

We only have evidence in the bottom layer in PCCDBNs, but this will come handy in the next section.

with boundary condition ψk0 = Pk Ψ0k−1 for all k. Also,
since Xk eventually changes in this scenario, ψkM = 0.
ψ̂ accounts for the terms where the node never
changes:
X
ψ̂kM =
(20)
Pbki · PkM −i · Ψik−1 .
0≤i≤M

Because the upper index refers to the changepoint of
Xk , only ψ̂kM is non-zero. We can just compute this in
O(M ) without the need for recurrences.
Initialization of the Ψ-recurrences happens at the
root(s) of the network. For any root r, Ψ0r = Pbk and reM −1 b b

PCC-DBN and belief propagation

We have just defined PCC-DBN, a version of belief
propagation that first collects the evidence by passing
the λ-messages towards the root of the chain and the
proceeds to distribute information towards the leaves
via the π-messages. After propagation is complete, we
can obtain any posterior as
p(X̃k |O) = Σk+1 · Ψk .

(21)

It is now useful to recall the types of potentials involved in Pearl’s algorithm [8] and how they relate
to the quantities above. For each node X, there
are local potentials πX (x) ≡def p(X = x|e+
X ) and
+
−
λX (x) ≡def p(e−
|X
=
x),
where
e
and
e
denote
reX
X
X
spectively the evidence reachable through parents and
the evidence reachable from X “downwards”, X included. There are two types of messages in Pearl’s algorithm: πX→Yi sent by X to its children and λX→Ui
sent to its parents. A closer look at PCC-DBN reveals
that each Σk is identical to λXk →Xk−1 — the message
from Xk to its single parent Xk−1 . The local potential
λXk (jk ) is identical to Σk+1 , because there are no children other than Xk+1 and evidence is only observed
at the bottom of the chain. Ψk corresponds directly
to πXk (jk ). This is why Equation 21 works.
3.5

Simple Generalizations and Causal Trees

While PCC-DBNs are useful for demonstrating the
general ideas of handling the probability distributions
arising from the changepoint transformation, they
form a rather restricted class of networks, and the inference query that we performed was also restricted.
Here we state succinctly a set of simple alterations
which allow this algorithm to be relaxed in various
ways:
General evidence patterns We can have observations anywhere in the network, in any time slice.

Casting the inference as belief propagation gives the
answer to any probabilistic query as Equation 21 with
one caveat: An observation such as X33 = 1 does not
tell us with certainty the position of the changepoint,
but it just provides evidence that j3 < 3, thus we
cannot simply set the changepoint variable to state 3.
Rather, the potentials corresponding to such evidence
must be multiplied onto the messages as prescribed by
the belief propagation algorithm (see Equation 22).
Non-stationarity Stationarity of conditional probability distributions was used to simplify the formulae
in the previous exposition, but is not required. All
that is needed is to keep running products of respective
probabilities instead of the powers in the exponents of
Pk , Pbk . They need to be computed incrementally and
tabulated to avoid hidden linear terms in the computation.
Extension to trees The extension of PCC-DBN
to causal trees (PCT-DBNs) is now fairly straightforward. Because each node Xk can now have multiple
children Ch(Xk ), we must replace Σk in all recurrences
with the true λ-potential for Xk :
Y
λXk = λXk →Xk ·
Σi ,
(22)
i∈Ch(Xk )

where λXk →Xk accounts for evidence observed in Xk ’s
temporal chain. The vector λXk →Xk is zero where the
evidence rules out a changepoint — before the time t
of the last observed Xkt = 0 and after the time s of first
observed Xks = 1. Everywhere else, λXk →Xk (jk ) = 1.
Note that λX (x) potential can be obtained in O(M )
time per node.
In computation of ψ potentials, Ψk on the right-hand
side of the recurrences is replaced by the πP a(Xk )→Xk ,
which in turn include the influence of evidence under
Xk ’s siblings:
Y
πP a(Xk )→Xk = πXk ·
Σi .
(23)
i∈Ch(P a(Xk ))\Xk

Again, this preserves the O(M ) per-node complexity.
Thus, PCT-DBN is linear in both N and M .

4

Further Generalizations

In this section we describe three more important generalizations of PC-DBNs: polytrees, non-persistent
nodes, and finally an approximate algorithm for general DAGs. These relaxations are more involved than
those of Section 3.5 and thus require more elaboration.
4.1

Polytrees

Belief propagation [16, 17] is a powerful framework for
exact inference in polytree networks. Polytrees, unlike

trees, allow multiple parents of a node, but remain
acyclic in the undirected sense. In polytree changepoint networks, structure in the conditional probability table P (X = x|U ) can be exploited to save a multiplicative factor of M + 1 just as we showed for tree
networks. The ψ-recurrences run over the first parent variable, while the remaining parents are summed
over by brute force. Similarly, the σ-recurrences run
over the parent that the message is addressed to. For
instance, the definition of σ will be replaced by

are now functions of the joint configuration of the remaining parents U2: . The proportionality constant in
Equation 24 equals the product of the remaining parents’ π-messages. We call this PPT-DBN, the persistent polytree algorithm.
The worst-case time complexity of PPT-DBN is dominated by the cost associated with the largest familyclique: O((M + 1)Umax ). The 2T BN algorithm [12]
suffers a worst-case time complexity O(22N M ), as all
nodes in two slices may be entangled [9] in the clique
to connect the two subsequent time-slices, even though
the prototype network is a polytree [12, section 3.6.2].
Therefore, we expect PPT-DBN will be comparatively
better for shorter temporal chains of larger networks.
However, PPT-DBN really shines on space complexity.
At most O(M N ) memory is consumed, compared to
2TBN, where the potentials in the joint tree can grow
as large as O(22N ). Later we show experimentally how
dramatic the difference can be.
4.2

Non-persistent nodes

While it is convenient to assume that all non-leaf variables are persistent, it does limit the modeling power
at our disposal. We now show how an occasional nonpersistent variable in the network can also be handled
in polynomial time. We assume the non-persistent
variable is isolated, that is, all of its neighbors are
persistent. We make this assumption in order to avoid
having to invoke an embedded general DBN inference

algorithm such as 2TBN to handle connected nonpersistent variables. It can be done, but quickly becomes complex and inelegant. A simple way to handle connected non-persistent nodes is to combine them
into a single joint node. Obviously, this solution causes
exponential growth in the state space of the joined
nodes, making it somewhat unappealing. A two-slice
approach made aware of the determinism, e.g. by use
of ADD compilation [3, 2], could very well work better
for networks with only a few persistent variables.
4.2.1

To illustrate how an isolated non-persistent node
would be handled, assume first a simple structure
such as in Figure 2. Then we can efficiently compute

The general case

Pearl’s belief propagation has been generalized to the
clique tree propagation algorithm [21]. With belief
propagation (BP), the cliques correspond to edges of
the original polytree and the separators consist of single nodes. In the process of message passing, the variables not in the separator are summed out of the clique
potentials.

A simple example

X1

k=1
1<k≤j
k =j+1
k >j+1

Therefore, we do not need to compute κ for every j,
but compute κki (M ) for all k as a special case and then
κki (M − 1) for all k to start the recursion. All other
values can be read off κki (M − 1) with the appropriate
indexing shift. Thus, we can obtain the entire distribution P (Ỹ ) in O(M ) time! Allowing non-persistent
variables to take on multiple values is also straightforward: we only need to allow the bottom index in κki
to range over the domain of Xk .

The PCT-DBN algorithm used the “natural” cliques
induced by the transformed network. Assume we have
a situation such as in Figure 3. Because the variable
C is not persistent, the size of the induced separator
C is 2M . However, we can work conceptually with
a larger clique BCD. Message propagation then calls
for summing out all C 1:M , which we can do without
actually instantiating the clique potential using a recurrence derived much like that of Equation 27. In
the interest of space, we only show here the simple κ
recurrence. The full recurrence calls for summing over
all persistent variables in the clique and the resulting
complexity is O((M + 1)B ), where B is the number of
persistent neighbors of the non-persistent variable.

Experimental evaluation

We implemented our algorithms in Matlab and compare them to the exact and approximate algorithms as
implemented in the Bayesian Network Toolbox (BNT)
[11]. Namely, we will compare to the Boyen-Koller
(BK) algorithm [1] in its 1) exact and 2) fully factored
setting. Although BK reduces in its exact form to
the incremental junction-tree algorithm, we found it
was faster in practice than the 2TBN implementation.

Filtering time (sec)

Matlab run-time is not the ideal measure of algorithm complexity as it is arguably more sensititve to
the quality of implementation compared to other languages. However, we should note that we did not make
any special effort to optimize our code for Matlab, and
the BNT library is a widely used and mature code
base, so we expect any advantages due to code quality
to fall to the competing approaches. Our Matlab code
and further evaluation results can be downloaded at

Speed of the tree algorithm

To compare inference speed, a network with the structure of a full binary tree with N nodes was generated.
Among the M N possible observations, 10% of the variables were set to a random value (subject to persistence constraints so that P (E) 6= 0). We measured
the time to execute the query p(X̃1 |E)—the posterior
probability over the root node—for each algorithm2 .
This process was repeated 100 times for each M , N
combination and the respective times added up. The
results are graphed out in Figures 4 and 5.
PCT-DBN outperforms both the exact incremental
joint tree algorithm and the approximate BK algorithm (assuming independence) by several orders of
magnitude as N , the size of a slice grows (Figure 4).
In fact, the exact algorithm soon runs out of memory (around N = 20) and only the approximate version keeps up. Exact PCT-DBN inference also performs consistently about 100 times faster than exact
junction-tree and approximate BK inference when we
look at scale-up with the number of slices, as shown in

The actual query is in fact irrelevant as all algorithms
compute all posterior marginals simultaneously.

Speed of the polytree algorithm

The asymptotic time complexity of PPT-DBN, as M
increases, may be less favorable than that of the incremental approaches. However, its lower memory complexity is very favorable, as documented by the following experiment. We generated a network where most
non-root nodes have exactly 2 parents and measured
the time for the three inference algorithms. Quadratic
scale-up with M is expected for PPT-DBN in such a
network.
Figure 6 shows the exact PPT-DBN algorithm to be
several times faster than, but scaling very similarly
to, the approximate fully factorized Boyen-Koller algorithm with an M = 20 time slice inference window.
Peeking ahead into Figure 7 suggests the time performance would be about identical at M = 70 time slices.
The junction-tree algorithm does not scale beyond 20
nodes due to memory usage.
Figure 7 shows clearly that asymptotically, PPT-DBN

scales with a steeper slope than both BK inference and
junction-tree inference. Indeed, for about N = 70,
BK eventually surpasses PPT-DBN in terms of speed.
However, it remains faster than junction-tree incremental inference throughout the range. On a computer with 1 GB RAM, the exact version begins to hit
memory limits around M = 200 and N = 17.
We conclude that if exact inference is desired for persistent polytree causal networks, using the PPT-DBN
algorithm is a better choice for a wide range of inference window lengths. Furthermore, if approximate
inference is acceptable, we show in Section 5.3 that for
large enough N , fixed window smoothing using PPTDBN can outperform BK inference in terms of RMS
error, while still performing many times faster. For the
special case of persistent causal trees, the new algorithm dominates by orders of magnitude in all ranges
that we tested versus both junction tree and BK assuming intra-slice independence.

Fixed-window approximation

A minor disadvantage of the PPT-DBN algorithm is
that it cannot do online inference yet. Therefore, when
monitoring a process, M grows and so does the computation time. In practice, only a fixed number of most
recent observations are usually considered with older
observations falling out of the “window”. Thus we
evaluate if reasonable precision can be attained with
small window sizes, where PPT-DBN dominates.

evidence older than W , for different values of W . We
use a binary tree prototype with all leaf variables nonpersistent and observed. All non-leaf variables are persistent and hidden. The CPT probabilities are sampled uniformly at random. The observed evidence O is
obtained by forward-sampling the DBN and restricting it to the observables. We find that the error of
our algorithm falls with growing W as expected. The
results become even more favorable for PC-DBN as
N, the number of nodes per slice, grows (see also further results online). The error made by fixing the
inference window tends to be lower than that of the
Boyen-Koller approximation for reasonable values of
W and we can eliminate the unfavorable dependence
on M at a small price of accuracy. One clear drawback to a naive implementation of the fixed-window
approach is that if evidence is not observed at each
time slice, in the presence of persistence a piece of
crucial evidence might drop off the window preventing
the model from “remembering” that a persistent state
was already acheived. This glitch could in principle be
fixed by caching when persistent variables have turned
on.

Conclusions and future work

We presented an algorithm for PC-DBNs, a way to
exploit the special structure of the DBN probability
distribution when many variables are persistent. Unlike forward-backward approaches to DBN inference
that work slice-to-slice, we collapse the entire temporal progression and perform inference in the original prototype network structure. For trees, the algorithm is many times faster than state-of-the-art
general-purpose exact and approximate DBN inference
algorithms, while having a space complexity of only

O(M N ). This continues to hold even in the polytree generalization with inference window lengths into
the hundreds. While this method does not directly
yield an incremental filtering algorithm, we show that
a fixed-window smoothing version of PC-DBN inference can perform approximate filtering faster and with
comparable or less error than BK-filtering.
Although we have not presented a filtering algorithm
that can exploit persistence, we do believe that one
is possible. The number of possible joint configurations of variables in two subsequent slices is 3N with
the persistence assumption as opposed to 4N in the
general network. This hints at the possibility of a
2TBN-like algorithm leveraging persistence and still
remaining linear in the number of time slices.

Another possible direction for this work is to allow
multi resolution temporal modeling by modeling systems on very short time scales, but utilizing a persistence approximation for the slow processes. In such
cases, a model with a single time-scale could efficiently
and accurately deal with systems that have both fast
and slow processes.

Also interesting is the vision of approximate inference
algorithms not requiring persistence, but simply assuming that the hidden state changes at most once
in the period of interest. If the change in the hidden
state is relatively slow, this could be a fairly accurate approximation. Such problems are often found
in bioinformatics areas such as phylogeny discovery,
where time of a mutation is of interest [6].
