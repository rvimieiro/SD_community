nodes and causal dependencies in OCNs are quanti­
fied by providing obj ections rather than probabilities.
In PCNs. a causal dependency between n od es is
quantified by providing a number in the interval [0.1].
For example. the depeudency from .4 = "Tlw grass is
wet'' to B = "My shoes are wet" may be quantified by
p = .�5. The number pis int.erpret.ed as a conditional
probability of the effect B given the cause A. Condi­

tional probabilities are usually assessed by a domain
expert or obtained from statistical data. However.
most domain experts have difficulty assessing these
probabilities and stat-istical data may not always be
available [6. 1).
In OCNs, a causal dependency between nodes is
quantified hy providing a logical sentence under

.

One could state at least three factors that make PCNs
so popular. First, PCNs allow the representation of
non-binary beliefs, which is not. allowed by classical
logic representations. Next, constructing a consistent
PCN is much easier and more systematic than con­
structing a consistent classical logic theory. Finally,
PCNs an• based on probability theory. which sup­
ports many patterns of plausible reasoning [11. 12)
that. are not supported by classical logic.
OCNs enjoy all the above properties. Section 2 shows
that an OCN can be interpreted as a state of belief
that allows non-binary beliefs. Section 3 shows that
constructing a consistent OCN is very similar to con­
structing a PCN. Finally. Section 4 shows how to
compute a state of belief represented by an OCN,
and Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.

OBJECTION-BASES STATES OF
BELIEF

In probability calculus. we assess our ronfidence in a
sentence by providing a number in the interval [U. 1).
If we have complete confid e nce in a sentence. we give
it a probability of l; otherwise, we give it a probabil­
ity of less than one. Another way to assess our con­
fidence in a. sentence is by providing an objectiOn to
that sentence. For example. an objection to ''Twf:'ety
is a bird implies Tweety flies" is "Tweety is wing­
less." This choice of assessing one's confidence leads
to objection calculus. which underlies objection-bas�>d
states of belief and causal net.works.

If degrees of support are probabili ties . then a state
of belief and the causal network representing it are
called probabilistic. F i gure I and Tab le 2 constitute

objections. then a state of belief and the causal net­
work r e pre"ent i ng it. are called objection-ba'>ed. Fig­

From here on. I assum e that objections are sentences
in a propositional language 0. I also assume that

CONSISTENCY

Probability theory imposes three consistency condi­
tions on probabilistic states of belief. First. the pr ob ­
ability of a t au tology must be one. Second. the prob­

ability of a disjunction of logically disjoint sent.enres

must be the sum of the probabilities of each of the dis­
jun cts. Finally. equivalent sentences mu st have equal

probabilit-ies. An objection-ba<oed state of belief ell

quantified causal network. The topology of this graph
contains i nfor mati on that partiall y defines a s t ate of

of s upport These a re either probabilities or objec­

the su bjec t of Section 3.1. T he last comp onent of a
causal network consists of conditional degrees of sup­

quantify causal dependen cies in t he network and are
the subject of Section 3.2. The three components of
a causal netw ork fully define a state of belief.

IRRELEVANCE

The third component of a causal net.work is a directed
graph such as the one depicted in Figure l. The
syntax of the graph does not depend on whether it is
part of a PCN or an OCN, but its interpretation (the
information it represents) does.
Informally. the directed graph of a causal network

The above statements are contradictory if the domain

Figure 1. once we know that "The grass is wet, .. the
information "It rained" does not. ch ange the support
for �My shoes are wet."

Contradictory statements of the form given above are
a result of careless assesm
s ent. of one ·s objections. An
IO'Xample will illustrate this point. We all know that

Probabilitv calculus formalizes irrelevance in terms of
condition�! probability. The statement "A becomes
irrelevant. to B once C is known'' is formalize d as
�The probability of B given C/1.4 equals the probabil­
it.y of B given only C." Formally. irrelevance informa­
tion represented by a PCN can be summarized by a
siugle t>quation. If D(i) conta ins the parents of propo­
sition Pi. and 0( i) contain s its non-descendants. t he n

expert. is us ing Equation 1 to update his state of be­
lief. Specifically, according to Equation 1, b m u st

having no wings is an objecti on to an

\Ve also know that. abnormality is an objection t.o the
flying of a bird:

Although the two statement s above seem plausibl e.
they are in fact cont.ra.di<'t.ory in the wntext of Equa­

Degrees of support in

tificat.ion has forced us to say that. the c aus al de­
pendency from "It rained" to "The grass is wet"
is weaker than the one from "The grass is Wf't''
to "Mv shoes are wet." No such commitment is
enforc�d by objection-based quantification.
