effective driver of preference elicitation [14, 4, 5]. However, prior work on regret-based elicitation for GAI models
has ignored key semantic issues, thus simplifying the approach to both elicitation and regret computation and optimization. By building on the semantic foundations of GAI
elicitation laid out in [6], we identify new classes of elicitation queries suitable for regret-based elicitation, and propose several new query strategies based on these classes.
Our approach emphasizes local queries over small sets of
attributes; but global queries over full outcomes are required to calibrate certain terms across GAI factors (a problem ignored in previous work on regret-based elicitation).
However, we will demonstrate that most of the “heavy lifting” can be achieved using local queries. Our new approach guarantees the semantic soundness of the utility representation in a way that techniques that ignore interactions
across factors do not. In addition, our new queries impose
much more intricate constraints on GAI model parameters
than those considered in previous work. For this reason,
we develop new formulations of the linear mixed integer
programs (MIPs) that are used in regret-based optimization, and show that the problem can be effectively solved
despite the added complexity.
We begin in Sec. 2 with relevant background on multiattribute utility. We discuss appropriate forms of both local and global queries for GAI elicitation in Sec. 3. We
then describe effective MIP formulations for minimax regret computation in Sec. 4, including discussion of regret
computation in multiattribute product databases. Sec. 5
presents several elicitation strategies based on the query
types above as well as empirical evaluation. Future directions are summarized in Sec. 6.

2 Multiattribute preferences
Assume a set of attributes X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn , each with finite
domains, which define a set of outcomes X = X1 × · · · ×
Xn . The preferences of a user, on whose behalf decisions
are made, are captured by a utility function u : X 7→ R. A
utility function can viewed as reflecting (qualitative) pref-

26

BRAZIUNAS & BOUTILIER

erences over lotteries (distributions over outcomes) [10],
with one lottery preferred to another iff its expected utility
is greater. Let hp, x> ; 1 − p, x⊥ i denote the lottery where
the best outcome x> is realized with probability p, and
the worst outcome x⊥ with probability 1 − p; we refer to
best and worst outcomes as anchor outcomes. Since utility
functions are unique up to positive affine transformations,
it is customary to set the utility of the best outcome x> to
1, and the utility of the worst outcome x⊥ to 0. If a user
is indifferent between some outcome x and the standard
gamble hp, x> ; 1 − p, x⊥ i, then u(x) = p.
2.1 Additive utilities
Since the size of outcome space is exponential in the number of attributes, specifying the utility of each outcome
is infeasible in many practical applications. Most preferences, however, exhibit internal structure that can be used
to express u concisely. Additive independence [10] is commonly assumed in practice, where u can be written as a
sum of single-attribute subutility functions:1
u(x) =

n
X
i=1

ui (xi ) =

n
X

λi vi (xi ).

i=1

The subutility functions ui (xi ) = λi vi (xi ) can be defined
as a product of local value functions (LVFs) vi and scaling constants λi . This simple factorization allows us to
separate the representation of preferences into two components: “local” and “global.” Significantly, LVFs can be
defined using “local” lotteries that involve only a single attribute: vi (xi ) = p, where p is the probability at which
the user is indifferent between two local outcomes xi and
⊥
2
hp, x>
i ; 1 − p, xi i, ceteris paribus. Since we can define
value functions independently of other attributes, we can
also assess them independently using queries only about
values of attribute i. This focus on preferences over individual attributes has tremendous practical significance, because people have difficulty taking into account more than
five or six attributes at a time [9].
The scaling constants λi are “global” and are required to
properly calibrate LVFs across attributes. To define the
scaling constants, we first introduce a notion of a reference
(or default) outcome, denoted by x0 = (x01 , x02 , . . . , x0n ).
The reference outcome is an arbitrary outcome, though it is
common to choose the worst outcome x⊥ as x0 (more generally, any salient outcome, such as an “incumbent” will
prove useful in this role). Let x>i be a full outcome where
the ith attribute is set to its best level whereas other attributes are fixed at their reference levels; x⊥i is defined
similarly. Then, λi = u(x>i ) − u(x⊥i ). To assess scaling

This decomposition is possible iff a user is indifferent between lotteries with the same marginals on each attribute.

constants λi , one must ask queries about 2n global outcomes x>i and x⊥i for each attribute i.3 These global
outcomes are special because they involve varying only a
single feature from the reference outcome. This ease of assessment makes additive utility the model of choice in most
practical applications.
2.2 Generalized additive utilities
Simple additive models, although very popular in practice,
are quite restrictive in their assumptions of attribute independence. A more general utility decomposition, based
on generalized additive independence (GAI), has recently
gained more attention because of its additional flexibility
[1, 3, 8, 4, 6]. It can model “flat” utility functions with no
internal structure as well as linear additive models. Most
realistic problems arguably fall somewhere between these
two extremes.
GAI models [7, 1] additively decompose a utility function
over (possibly overlapping) subsets of attributes. Formally,
assume a given collection {I1 , . . . , Im } of possibly intersecting attribute (index) sets, or factors. Given an index set
I ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, we define XI = ×i∈I Xi to be the set of
partial outcomes (or suboutcomes) restricted to attributes in
I. For a factor j, xIj , or simply xj , is a particular instantiation of attributes in factor j. The factors are generalized
additively independent if and only if the user is indifferent
between any two lotteries with the same marginals on each
set of attributes [7]. Furthermore, if GAI holds, the utility
function can be written as a sum of subutility functions [7]:
u(x) = u1 (xI1 ) + . . . + um (xIm ).
The key difference between additive and GAI models with
regard to elicitation (rather than representation) lies in the
semantics of subutility functions ui . In additive models, the
quantities ui (xi ) = λi vi (xi ) have a very clear decisiontheoretic meaning.4 In contrast, GAI subutility functions
are not unique and, in the absence of further qualifications, do not have a well-defined semantic interpretation.
This makes elicitation of GAI model parameters problematic. Intuitively, since utility can “flow” from one subutility
factor to another through shared attributes, the values of
subutility uj do not directly represent the local preference
relation among the attributes in factor j.
For effective elicitation we therefore need a representation of GAI utilities such that: 1) all GAI model parameters have a sound semantic interpretation; and, 2) the GAI
structure is reflected by separating the parameters into local
and global groups, in a way analogous to additive models.
Building on the foundational work of Fishburn [7], we [6]
Only n outcomes if the reference outcome is also the worst.
In additive utility models, the LVF vi (xi ) is simply the
probability p at which the user is indifferent between xi and

Knowing the dependency structure, Eq. 2 can be simplified
by introducing the following notation. Let Nj be the number of local configurations (settings of attributes) in factor
j (e.g., with 3 boolean attributes, Nj = 8). The LVF vj
N
can be expressed by Nj parameters vj1 , . . . , vj j such that
vji = vj (xj ), where i is the index of the local configuration
xj . Then, Eq. 2 can be rewritten as

Iis ∩Ij ]).

s=1

(2)

The sum in the equation is only over non-empty interTk
sections s=1 Iis ∩ Ij . For any x, x[I] is an outcome
where attributes not in I are set to the reference value (i.e.,
Xi = xi if i ∈ I, and Xi = x0i if i ∈
/ I). For further
details, we refer to [6].
Our key result [6] shows that the function vj in Eq. 2 generalizes LVFs defined earlier for additive models. Let the
conditioning set Kj of factor j be the set of all attributes
that share GAI factors with attributes in j. Intuitively,
fixing the attributes in the conditioning set to any value
“blocks” the influence of other factors on factor j. In a
manner similar to additive models, the local value vj (xj )
of suboutcome xj is simply p, the probability that induces
indifference between xj and the local standard gamble
⊥
hp, x>
j ; 1 − p, xj i, given that attributes in the conditioning set Kj are fixed at reference levels, ceteris paribus. We
refer to the setting of attributes in Kj to their reference values (ceteris paribus) as the local value condition. Here x>
j
and x⊥
j are the best and worst suboutcomes in factor j assuming the local value condition; by definition, the LVFs
⊥
are normalized, so vj (x>
j ) = 1 and vj (xj ) = 0. We
see, then, that LVFs have a very clear semantic interpretation; they calibrate local preferences relative to the best
and worst factor suboutcomes under the local value condition. Thus LVFs are local, involving only attributes in
single factors and their (usually small) conditioning sets.
The global scaling constants λj are defined in a way analogous to the additive utility case. Let x>j and x⊥j be the
best and the worst (full) outcomes, given that attributes
not in factor j are set to their reference levels. Then,
⊥
λj = u(x>j ) − u(x⊥j ) = u>
j − uj . We will refer to
⊥
u>
j and uj as anchor utilities for factor j.
To compute the unscaled subutility function ūj (xj ), one
needs to know
Tk which local suboutcomes are involved (in
the form xj [ s=1 Iis ∩ Ij ]) on the right-hand side of Eq. 2;
Tk
this amounts to finding all nonempty sets s=1 Iis ∩ Ij
and recording the sign (+/−) for the corresponding LVFs.
We refer to this procedure as computing the dependency
structure of a GAI model. An efficient graphical search
algorithm for computing such dependencies among LVFs
was first described in [6].

where the Cxi j are integer coefficients precomputed using
the dependency structure (most of these are zero).
Thus, a GAI model, similar to simple additive utility functions, is additively decomposed into factors that are a prod⊥
uct of scaling constants, or weights, λj = u>
j − uj , and a
linear combination of LVF parameters:
u(x) =

This representation of GAI utilities achieves the goals described above: the representation is unique, all parameters
have a well-defined semantics, and they are grouped into
local (LVFs) and global (anchor utilities) parameters. The
next section introduces appropriate queries for assessing
these GAI model parameters. (The GAI model structure
is represented by parameters Cxi j .)

3 Elicitation queries
In general, eliciting complete preference information is
costly and, in most cases, unnecessary for making an optimal decision. Instead, elicitation and decision making can
be viewed as a single process whose goal is to achieve the
right tradeoff between the costs of interaction, potential improvements of decision quality due to additional preference
information, and the value of a terminal decision [2].
The types of queries one considers is an integral part of
the preference elicitation problem. Some queries are easy
to answer, but do not provide much information, while
more informative queries are often costly. Computing or
estimating the value of information can vary considerably
for different query types. Finally, allowable queries define the nature of constraints on the feasible utility set. We
broadly distinguish global queries over full outcomes from
local queries over subsets of outcomes. In most multiattribute problems, people can meaningfully compare outcomes with no more than five or six attributes [9]. Therefore, we propose local counterparts to global queries that
apply to a subset of attributes.
From Eq. 4, we can see that a GAI utility function can be
fully assessed by eliciting the LVF parameters vji and the
⊥
anchor utilities u>
j and uj . The LVF parameters can be

28

BRAZIUNAS & BOUTILIER

determined by posing local queries; such queries do not
require a user to consider the values of all attributes. In addition, to achieve the right calibration of the LVFs, we need
to elicit utilities of a few full outcomes: for each factor, we
must know the utility of the best and the worst outcomes
given that attributes in other factors are set to their refer⊥
ence levels (i.e., elicit the values u>
j and uj ).

Anchor comparison queries We can also ask a user
to compare anchor outcomes from different factors: “Do
you prefer global outcome x>k to x⊥l ”? If “yes”, then
⊥
>
⊥
u>
k ≥ ul ; if “no”, then uk < ul . Such anchor comparison (AC) queries are usually much easier to answer than
anchor bound queries.

We will consider four types of queries for elicitation. The
following queries are well-defined semantically, relatively
simple, and easy to explain to non-expert users.

4 Minimax regret calculation

Local bound queries An LVF calibrates utilities of partial outcomes with respect to partial “anchor” outcomes x>
j
and x⊥
j , given that the attributes in conditioning set Kj are
fixed at their reference levels. A local bound (LB) query on
parameter vjx is as follows: “Assume that the attributes in
Kj are fixed at reference levels. Would you prefer the par⊥
tial outcome xj to a lottery hx>
j , p; xj , 1 − pi, assuming
that the remaining attributes are fixed at same levels (ceteris paribus)?” If the answer is “yes”, vjx ≥ p; if “no”,
then vjx < p. By definition, the local value parameters vjx
lie in [0,1]. This binary (yes/no) query differs from a direct
(local) standard gamble query since we do not ask the user
to choose the indifference level p, only bound it.
Local comparison queries Local comparisons are natural and easy to answer. A local comparison (LC) query
asks a user to compare two partial outcomes: “Assume that
the attributes in Kj are fixed at reference levels. Would
you prefer partial outcome xj to partial outcome x0j , ce0
teris paribus?” If the answer is “yes”, vjx ≥ vjx ; if “no”,
0
then vjx < vjx .
Anchor bound queries The scaling constant, or weight,
⊥
for a subutility function ūj is λj = u>
j − uj , where
>
uj is the global utility of the outcome in which the j th
factor is set to its best value, and all the other attributes
are fixed at reference levels. Similarly, u⊥
j is the utility of the “bottom anchor” of factor j. Utilities of an⊥
>
⊥
chor levels u>
1 , u1 , . . . , um , um must be obtained using
global queries. However, we need only ask 2m direct utility queries over full outcomes; this is the same number
of global queries required for scaling in the additive case
(considering each attribute as a factor).
Instead of eliciting exact anchor utilities directly, we propose global queries that are easier to answer. An anchor
bound (AB) query asks: “Consider a full outcome x>j ,
where attributes in factor j are set to their best values, and
other attributes are fixed at reference levels. Do you prefer
x>j to a lottery hx> , p; x⊥ , 1 − pi?” A “yes” response
>
gives u>
j ≥ p; and “no”, uj < p (assuming, without loss
>
of generality, that u(x ) = 1 and u(x⊥ ) = 0). An analogous query exists for the “bottom” anchor x⊥j .

In our model, the uncertainty over user utility functions is
defined by (linear) constraints on utility function parameters, specifically, those induced by responses to queries of
the form above. Without distributional information w.r.t.
possible utility functions, the minimax regret decision criterion is especially suitable. It requires that we recommend
a feasible outcome x∗ that minimizes maximum regret with
respect to all possible realizations of the user’s utility function [3, 12, 4]. This guarantees worst-case bounds on the
quality of the decision made under the type of strict uncertainty induced by the queries above [14, 4, 5]. In case
further preference information is available, a regret-based
elicitation policy can be employed to reduce utility uncertainty and minimize interaction costs to the extent where
an (approximately) optimal decision can be recommended
(see Sec. 5).
Let U be the set of feasible utility functions, defined by
constraints—induced by user responses to queries—on the
⊥
values of factor anchors u>
j , uj (for each factor j), and
constraints on the LVF parameters vji . Let F eas(X) ⊆ X
be the set of feasible outcomes (e.g., defined by a set of hard
constraints H). We define minimax regret in three stages
(following [4]). The pairwise regret of choosing x instead
of x0 w.r.t. U is R(x, x0 , U) = maxu∈U u(x0 ) − u(x). The
maximum regret of choosing outcome x is M R(x, U) =
maxx0 ∈F eas(X) R(x, x0 , U). Finally, the outcome that
minimizes max regret is the minimax optimal decision:
M M R(U) = minx∈F eas(X) M R(x, U). We develop
tractable formulations of these definitions for GAI models.
Pairwise regret Given a GAI model, the pairwise regret
of x w.r.t. x0 over U is:
R(x, x0 , U) = max u(x0 ) − u(x)

In general, when constraints on utility space tie together
parameters from different factors, regret computation has a
quadratic objective. Such constraints might arise, for example, from global comparison queries. With linear constraints, this becomes a quadratic program.

BRAZIUNAS & BOUTILIER
Since factors reflect intrinsic independencies among attributes, it is natural to assume that utility constraints involve only parameters within the same factor. The constraints induced by local comparison or bound queries, for
instance, have this form. We call constraints involving parameters within a single factor local. This allows modeling
regret computation linearly as we discuss below.
If the constraints on local value parameters vji are local then
Eq. 5 can be simplified by pushing one “max” inward. This

violated constraints are found (see [4] for details).

Multiattribute product databases The MIP formulations above assume that the space of feasible configurations is defined by a set of constraints H specifying allowable combinations of attributes. Alternatively, the set
of choices may be the elements of a multiattribute product
database, in which the set of feasible outcomes is specified explicitly, namely, as the set of all products in the
database. Preference-based search of, and choice from,
such a database can be effected using minimax regret as
well, but can in fact be somewhat simpler computationally.
For any two database items x and x0 , pairwise regret
R(x, x0 , U) can be computed using Eq. 6. The max regret M R(x) of x is determined by considering its pairwise regret with each other item. To determine the optimal product (i.e., with minimax regret), we compute the
M R(x) of each item x and choose the one with least max
regret. This latter computation can be sped up considerably
by iteratively generating minimax optimal candidate products against a current set of “adversary” items and testing
their optimality. In practice, much like constraint generation, this speed up reduces the complexity of the algorithm
from quadratic to linear in the size of the database.

5 Elicitation strategies
Minimax regret allows one to bound the loss associated
with the recommended decision relative to the (unknown)
optimal. If this bound on utility loss is too high, more utility information must be elicited. A decision support system can query the user until minimax regret reaches some
acceptable level (possibly optimality), elicitation costs become too high, or some other termination criterion is met.
We propose a generalization of the current solution (CS)
elicitation strategy, first described in [4]. This strategy has
been shown empirically to be very effective in reducing
minimax regret with few queries in several domains [4, 5].
The CS strategy considers only parameters involved in
defining minimax regret (i.e., the current regret-minimizing
solution x∗ and the adversary’s witness xw ), and asks a
query about the parameter that offers the largest potential
reduction in regret. We define below how we score various
query types, and then define potential query strategies.

Local queries The pairwise regret of regret-minimizing
outcome x∗ and witness xw (the current solution) is:

where Cji = Cxi w
− Cxi ∗j , and {u̇>
j , u̇j , v̇j } are utility paj
rameter values that maximize regret. A local bound query
adds a constraint on a local parameter vji . We wish to find
the parameter vji that offers the largest potential reduction
in the pairwise regret R(x∗ , xw , U) at the current solution,
hence in the overall minimax regret. The linear constraints
on local parameters induce a polytope defining the feasible
space for the parameters for each factor. Our elicitation
strategies use the bounding hyperrectangle of this polytope
as an approximation of this feasible region. This allows for
quick computation of query quality. (The bounding hyperrectangle can be computed by solving two very small LPs,
linear in factor size.) Let gapij = vji ↑ −vji ↓. If we ask
a bound query about the midpoint of the gap, the response
narrows the gap by half (either lowering the upper bound or
raising the lower bound). The impact of constraining vji on
the pairwise regret R(x∗ , xw , U) is mediated by the magnitude of a constant Cji and the current value of a scaling
⊥
factor (u̇>
j − u̇j ). We define the heuristic score for querying parameter vji , a measure of its potential for reducing
minimax regret, as:
⊥
i
i
S(vji ) = (u̇>
j − u̇j ) abs(Cj ) gapj /2

The best bound query is that with the highest score. Determining this is linear in the number of GAI parameters.
Scoring local comparison queries is a more complicated,
since it is more difficult to estimate the impact of adding a
linear constraint on minimax regret. We again approximate
the feasible local parameter space with a bounding hyperrectangle. Given the current solution, we consider a list of
all pairs {(vji , vjk )} such that: (a) Cji 6= 0 and Cjk 6= 0; (b)
vji ↑≥ vjk ↓ and vjk ↑≥ vji ↓; and (c) the relationship between
vji and vjk is not known due to earlier queries. These conditions severely limit the number of pairs one must consider
when determining the best local comparison query. The
first condition eliminates many parameters from consideration because most coefficients Cji are zero. The second
checks the bounds for implied relationships. Finally, the relationship between two parameters might already be known
beforehand due to prior constraints or transitive closure of
previous comparison constraints.
For each pair (vji , vjk ) considered, we compute a heuristic
score as follows. First, we project the bounding hyperrectangle on the plane of the two parameters we are considering; the comparison constraint divides our 2-D rectangle
along the 45-degree line. Fig. 1 shows all four cases and
demonstrates that, after a response to a comparison query,

In all cases, if the response to a comparison query eliminates the
part of the rectangle which contained the current solution point
(v̇ji , v̇jk ) (marked with a circle), the new solution point (marked
with a square) is one of the two intersections of the diagonal and
the bounding rectangle. The shaded area approximates feasible
parameter space after a response to a comparison query.

the values of the parameters
(as well as the current
level of regret) either remain the same, or they are pushed
to lie at one of the two intersections of the diagonal with
the bounding rectangle. In the latter case, the reduction in
local regret can be approximated by
rji,k = Cji v̇ji + Cjk v̇jk − max(Cji t1 + Cjk t1 , Cji t2 + Cjk t2 ),

where (t1 , t1 ), (t2 , t2 ) are the coordinates of the two intersections. The heuristic score for comparing xij to xkj is:
⊥
i,k
S(xij , xkj ) = (u̇>
j − u̇j ) rj .

The complexity of finding the best comparison query is
linear in the number factors and quadratic in the number of
local outcomes in each factor.
Global queries We use similar heuristic methods to compute the score of global anchor queries. In this case, we
look at the impact of imposing constraints on anchor

constant. The resulting heuristic scores for both local and
global queries are commensurable, allow comparison of
different query types during elicitation.
Combining different queries If all types of queries are
available, we can simply choose the next query to ask based
on the heuristic score S described above. However, in general we want to consider not only the impact of a query in
reducing regret, but also its cost to a user. Global queries
are generally harder to answer than local queries; similarly,
most users will find comparing two outcomes easier than
dealing with bound queries (which require some numerical
calibration w.r.t. anchors). As such, the scores above are
viewed as ranking queries of a specific type relative to each
other. We can compare queries of different types by scaling these scores by, for example, cost factors that penalize
different types of queries.6

Queries of a single type could also be differentiated by various means (e.g., the number of attributes involved, the number set
to non-reference levels, etc.).

31

Instead, we consider several strategies that combine different query types without explicitly differentiating for
cost; but we examine strategies that use only the “easiest” queries. The LC strategy uses only local comparison
queries; when our heuristic cannot recommend a comparison query, a comparison query is then picked at random. If
instead of a random comparison query we select the best local bound query, we get the LC(LB) strategy. The LB strategy uses only local bound queries. The remaining strategies do not favor any query type, but simply recommend a
query from the set of allowed types with the highest score:
LC+LB combines local comparison and bound queries, and
AB+LC+LB and AB+LB mix global anchor bound queries
with local queries.
Experimental results We tested our CS elicitation strategies on the car rental configuration problem from [4, 6]
and a small apartment rental database problem. The carrental problem is modeled with 26 attributes that specify
various attributes of a car relevant to typical rental decisions. The domain sizes of the attributes range from two
to nine values, resulting in 6.1 × 1010 possible configurations. The GAI model consists of 13 local factors, each
defined on at most five variables; the model has 378 utility
parameters. There are ten hard constraints defining feasible configurations. The apartment rental problem comprises a database of 186 apartments, described by eight attributes, each having between two and 33 domain values.
The GAI model has five factors, and can be specified with
156 utility parameters. The implementation was in Python,
using CPLEX 9.1 to solve MIPs in the car-rental problem
(the apartment database requires no MIPs). Computing the
regret-minimizing solution, which has to updated after each
query, takes about 1 second; determining the next query for
any given strategy is even faster. Thus our approach admits
real-time interaction.
We evaluated the six query strategies described above.
Fig. 2 shows their performance on (a) the car rental configuration problem, and (b) the apartment rental database
problem. The results are averaged over 20 random samples of the underlying user utilities as well as random prior
bounds on utility parameters. The upper anchor bounds
are drawn uniformly from [1,50], and lower bounds from
[-50,-1]. The LVF bounds are drawn uniformly from [0,1].
With the exception of the LC strategy, all strategies (including those that use only local queries) exhibit a sharp initial
reduction in minimax regret (from .30 to .05 with less than
40 interactions in the car-rental case). This means that in
many cases we can either avoid costly global queries altogether or use them only in situations where very strict
worst-case loss guarantees are required. Even though the
LC strategy does not perform as well as bound query strategies, we note that comparison queries (which are generally less costly in terms of user effort, time and accuracy than bound queries) are very effective during the first

ten or so interactions, and do not hinder the performance
of strategies in which they are used together with bound
queries. Not surprisingly, only strategies that use anchor
queries (AB+LC+LB and AB+LB) are able to reduce the
regret level to zero; however, the the performance of localqueries-only strategies, such as LC(LB), LC+LB and LB is
very encouraging.

6 Conclusions
We have provided a semantically justifiable approach to
elicitation of utility functions in GAI models using the minimax regret decision criterion. The structure of a GAI
model facilitates both elicitation and decision making via
the semantically sound separation of local and global components. We described suitable forms of local and global
queries and developed techniques for computing minimax
optimal decisions under strict utility uncertainty, captured
by linear constraints on the parameters of the GAI model.
Our elicitation strategies combine both local and global
queries and provide a practical way to make good decisions
while minimizing user interaction.
We are currently pursuing several extensions of this work.
We are: investigating techniques for the effective elicitation
of GAI utility structure (something we take as given in this
work); exploring the incorporation of probabilistic knowledge of utility parameters to help guide elicitation (while
still considering regret in making final decisions [14]); and
experimenting with additional query types. Query strategies that take into account explicit query costs are of interest, too. Finally, experiments with human decision makers
will allow us to consider the impact of psychological and
behavioral issues—such as framing and ordering effects,
sensitivity analysis, and different modes of interaction—on
our normative model of elicitation.
