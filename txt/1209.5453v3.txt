Abstract. Through systematic density functional calculations, the mechanism of the
substrate induced spin reorientation transition in FePc/O-Cu(110) was explained in
terms of charge transfer and rearrangement of Fe-3d orbitals. Moreover, we found
giant magnetoelectric effects in this system, manifested by the sensitive dependence
of its magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy energy on external electric field. In
particular, the direction of magnetization of FePc/O-Cu(110) is switchable between
in-plane and perpendicular axes, simply by applying an external electric field of 0.5
eV/Å along the surface normal.
Manipulation of magnetic properties of nanomaterials with an external electric
field (EEF) through the magnetoelectric effect is extremely attractive for the
development of both fundamental science and innovative spintronics devices. [1,2]
The magnetoelectric responses of nanomaterials are typically much enhanced with
respective to their bulk counterparts due to the size reduction, quantum confinement
effect and weakened screening. For instance, the magnetic ordering of a Mn-Mn
dimer on the Ag(001) surface can be conveniently switched between the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, by using an electric field of ~0.5 V/Å. [3]
In particular, extensive studies have been devoted to establish fundamental
understanding for how to control the magnetic anisotropy with EEF, since the
orientation of magnetization is of high importance for applications of nanomagnets.
[4,5,6,7,8,9] As building blocks in innovative spintronics and molecular electronics
nanodevices, organic magnetic molecules are of special research interest. [10,11] It
was found that the easy axis of magnetization of Fe-phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules
turns from the in-plane direction to the perpendicular direction in touch with the
oxidized Cu(110) [O-Cu(110)] surface. [12] For the development of molecular

spintronics, it is critical to establish clear insights for the substrate-induced spin
reorientation transition (SRT) and, furthermore, the magnetoelectric effect on a
prototype magnetic molecular system such as FePc/O-Cu(110).
In this Letter, we report results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations
for the electronic and magnetic properties of FePc/O-Cu(110). The mechanism of the
substrate-induced SRT was revealed, using the energy-level shifts and spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) matrices of molecular orbitals. It is striking that both magnitude and
sign of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (EMCA) of FePc/O-Cu(110) can be
altered by a moderate EEF, because of the electric field-induced electron charge
transfer between the FePc molecule and the substrate. Our findings indicate that
FePc/O-Cu(110) is a promising model magnetoelectric system for fundamental
studies and spintronics applications.

DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab-initio simulation package
(VASP), [13,14] at the level of the spin-polarized generalized-gradient approximation
(GGA). [15] To examine the reliability of structural models and electronic properties,
the non-local van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) which may significantly
improve the adsorption of large molecules, [16,17] and Hubbard U correction
(GGA+U) which accounts for the strong on-site Coulomb interactions among 3d
electrons, [18] were also used. We used the projector augmented wave (PAW) method
for the description of the ionic cores. [19,20] As sketched in Fig. 1, the O-Cu(110)
substrate was simulated by a slab model that has three Cu layers and one Cu-O
overlayer on each side, along with a 15 Å vacuum between adjacent slabs. The FePc
molecule was placed on O-Cu(110) in different angles, with the Fe-N axis along
either 30° (denoted as the α-type geometry) or 45° (denoted as the β-type geometry)
away from the [001] axis of the Cu lattice. [12] In addition, the core Fe atom of the
molecule may take site above either Cu or O atom of the substrate. Therefore, we
considered four possible geometries, referred as α/Cu (α-type, Fe on Cu), β/Cu
(β-type, Fe on Cu), α/O (α-type, Fe on O), and β/O (β-type, Fe on O). Nevertheless,
the adsorption sites were not constrained since the molecule was allowed to shift
sideways in calculations. To mimic adsorption of the single FePc molecule, a large
6×3 supercell in the lateral plane was adopted, with a dimension of 18.07×15.34 Å2.
The energy cutoff for the plane wave expansion was 400 eV, adequate for
FePc/O-Cu(110) according to our test calculations. A 3×3 k-grid mesh was used to
sample the tiny tow dimensional Brillouin zone. The bottom CuO layer and one Cu
layer were fixed, while the atomic positions in other layers were fully relaxed using
the conjugated gradient method for the energy minimization procedure, with a
criterion that requires force on each atom smaller than 0.01 eV/Å.

Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiments established that oxygen
atoms take the long bridge sites over the Cu(110) surface to form the striped CuO
overlayer. [21,22,23] Our total energy calculations confirmed that this is indeed the
ground state geometry of the O-Cu(110) substrate. Furthermore, we found that the
3"
"

Cu-O rows ripple on O-Cu(110), with O atoms higher than Cu atoms by 0.15 Å [see
Figs. 1(c) and (d)], in good accordance with the experimental data, 0.21±0.1 Å. [21]
The non-vanishing density of states at Fermi level of the CuO stripe indicates that the
CuO stripe is actually metallic, although it is assumed to act as insulating layer to
separate the adsorbates and the Cu(110) substrate. [12,24]

The stability of FePc/O-Cu(110) in different geometries is characterized by the
binding energy that is defined as
Eb = E[O-Cu(110)] + E(FePc) - E[FePc/O-Cu(110)] .

(1)

Here, E(FePc) is the total energy of the free FePc molecule, while E[FePc/O-Cu(110)]
and E[O-Cu(110)] stand for the total energies of O-Cu(110) with and without the
presence of the FePc molecule, respectively. As listed in Table I, the FePc molecule
prefers the α/O geometry on O-Cu(110) since it has the largest Eb (0.36 eV) among all
four configurations. Although the magnitude of Eb is small, the FePc molecule
deforms remarkably and, on the other hand, causes a significant surface
reconstruction on the O-Cu(110) substrate. As displayed in the bottom panels of Fig.
1, the O atom right under Fe is pulled out of the CuO stripe by as much as 0.7 Å
(denoted as d2). On the other side, Fe and its four N neighbors in the FePc molecule
drop down from the molecular base plane by 0.6 Å and 0.3 Å, respectively. Similar
structural deformation was also reported for Sn-Phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on
Ag(111) surface, where the central Sn atom is pulled down by ~0.5 Å towards the
substrate. [25] As a result, the Fe-O bond length is only 1.94 Å, indicating a strong
attraction between the two atoms. On the contrary, the carbon rings and substrate
repel each other, so d1 is as large as 3.1 Å. Therefore, FePc/O-Cu(110) manifests
mixed features of chemisorption and physisorption, i.e., a strong ionic bond but with a
very small binding energy.

Note that α/Cu and β/Cu geometries were assigned as the ground state geometries
in early report [12], different from what we found here through GGA calculations. To
solve this puzzle, we also optimized all four structures with the vdW-DF and GGA+U
approaches. The inclusion of Hubbard correction with U up to 4 eV appears not to
change atomic structure but the vdW-DF correction noticeably affects the atomic
structure. As given in parentheses in Table 1, vdW-DF calculations give larger d1 and
Eb for all four cases, compared to GGA data. Nonetheless, neither vdW-DF nor
GGA+U correction affects the adsorption site preference. For example, the energy
difference between α/O and α/Cu geometries with the vdW-DF correction is 0.19 eV,
very close to the corresponding GGA result, 0.17 eV. In addition, the energy
differences between α and β geometries are not much affected either (0.03 eV on O
and 0.07 eV on Cu). Therefore, we believe that the assignment of α/Cu as the ground
state geometry was a mistake. In the following, we mostly focus on GGA results of
the α/O geometry, with a note that properties of the co-existing β/O geometry are not
much different.
According to Bader’s charge analysis scheme, [26] the iron atom in FePc
transfers 0.43 electrons to the oxygen atom underneath. As a result, the spin magnetic
moment (MS) of FePc/O-Cu(110) enhances to 2.40 µB compared to 2.00 µB in the
5"
"

freestanding case. This value agrees excellently with the experimental data, 2.30±0.02
µB. [12] Significant spin-polarization is induced around the O and Cu atoms adjacent
to Fe, with MS of 0.15 µB for O and 0.03 µB for Cu, respectively. To better appreciate
the molecule-substrate interaction, we plot the partial density of states (PDOS) in Fig.
2 for both the free and the supported FePc molecules. Since the freestanding FePc
molecule has a D4h symmetry, the Fe-3d orbitals split into four groups: b1g (xy) and
b2g (x2-y2) for the in-plane components, along with a1g (z2) and eg (xz and yz) for the
out-of-plane components. [27,28] However, the actual energy spectrum of the Fe-3d
orbitals in Fig. 2(a) is somewhat different from this simple assignment, because of the
interaction with N-2p states. [29] For example, the lowest peak in the minority spin
channel comprises of b2g, eg and a1g features all together; the peak right above the
Fermi level combines the b2g and eg components. When the FePc molecule is placed
on O-Cu(110), the Fe-a1g orbital becomes delocalized as shown by the broad PDOS
features in Fig. 2(b). This manifests the strong hybridization between the Fe-a1g and
O-pz orbitals. Significantly, the two PDOS peaks across the Fermi level become more
“pure”: with the b2g state below EF and the eg state above EF. As a result, the contour
plot of the charge density difference shows the intra-molecular charge transfer from
the Fe-eg orbital to the Fe-b2g orbital in Fig. 2(c).

indicates the position of EF. (c) Electron density difference: Δρ=ρ[FePc/O-Cu(110)] ρ[O-Cu(110)] – ρ(FePc). Blue and red regions show charge depletion and

To determine the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, we adopted the torque

Here, !! !and !! are the projector functions and all-electron partial waves in the

7"
"

implementation, the calculated EMCA of a free FePc molecule is -1.24 meV, in good
agreement with that obtained from the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented
plane wave method, -1.18 meV. [28] The negative sign of EMCA indicates that the easy
axis lies in the base plane of the molecule, in good accordance with experimental
observations. [32,33] As seen in Table I, EMCA of FePc/O-Cu(110) indeed changes to
positive, 0.48 meV, so the switch of the easy axis to the perpendicular direction
reported by Tsuhakara et al [12] is confirmed. Although the amplitude of EMCA is
somewhat changed by vdW-DF or GGA+U correction (c.f., data in Table 1 and in
Supplemental materials), the substrate induced spin reorientation transition is
unaffected. Interestingly, EMCA remains negative for FePc on top of Cu, in GGA,
GGA+U and vdW-DF calculations. This is another evidence that FePc takes the O
site rather than the Cu site on O-Cu(110) as claimed before. [12, 34] It is worthwhile
to point out that Ref. [34] claimed good agreement with the experimental inelastic
electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) without attempting magnetic anisotropy
calculations. The “agreement” results from experimental parameters [12], and is
hence useless for the assignment of preferential adsorption site.

Now we can explore for the reasons that cause the substrate-induced SRT in
FePc/O-Cu(110) and thenceforth can find out ways to control it. Following the second
order perturbation approach proposed by Wang, Wu and Freeman, [35] EMCA can be
approximately determined by matrix elements of the angular momentum operators: Lz
and Lx, across the unoccupied (u) and occupied (o) states,

E MCA ≈ ξ 2 [∑

].

Similar procedure was also discussed for the calculations of magnetic anisotropy of
molecular magnets. [ 36 ] For convenience of analysis, we further subdivide
contributions from the majority spin states [EMCA(uu)], the minority spin states
[EMCA(dd)], and also the cross-spin coupling [EMCA(ud+du)]. For simplicity, we
discuss EMCA(dd) in details because it contributes most part of the total EMCA for both
free FePc and FePc/O-Cu(110) as discussed later. In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), we
8"
"

constructed a simple energy spectrum of Fe-3d orbitals in the minority spin channel
and plot all non-vanishing Lz and Lx elements across these states. With this
construction, one may easily estimate EMCA(dd) by inspecting the number and weight
of lines that intercept the Fermi level.

Figure 3. (a) and (b) Sketches of energy spectrum of Fe-3d states in the minority spin
channel and non-vanishing SOC matrix elements for the free FePc molecule and the
FePc/O-Cu(110) system, respectively. The horizontal dashed line shows the position
of the actual Fermi level for each case,!!!! . The thickness of each vertical line scales
with the magnitude of the corresponding SOC matrix element, and its color matches
to the wave function feature of the lower state in the pair. (c) and (d) Total and
spin-decomposed EMCA of the free FePc molecule and the FePc/O-Cu(110) system.
Shaded regions show the total EMCA with SOC contributions solely from Fe.
As clearly shown in Fig. 3(a), in the critical SOC pairs of the occupied states to
the empty states there is an imbalance between the seven Lx contributions to the three
Lz contributions, which leads to a negative EMCA(dd) for the free FePc molecule. In
FePc/O-Cu(110), the a1g orbital become delocalized and the eg orbital shifts to the
9"
"

unoccupied region [see Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)]. As a result, two thin Lx lines (i.e., with
small Lx elements) and two thick Lz lines (i.e., with large Lz elements) intercept the
Fermi level and EMCA(dd) thereby becomes positive. Following this argument, the
number of Lx lines exceeds that of Lz lines if its Fermi level shifts up to above the eg
state as seen in Fig. 3(b), by adding excessive electrons into the molecule, EMCA(dd)
of FePc/O-Cu(110) may become negative again. Such analyses can establish trends of
EMCA(dd) with respect to a shift of the Fermi level, !! − !!! , in order to guide an
experimental search. Quantitatively, we directly calculated the total and
spin-components of EMCA in a broad range of !! − !!! using the rigid band model.
As shown in Fig. 3 (c), EMCA(dd) of the free FePc molecule remains negative in the
range -0.5 eV < !! − !!! < 1.1 eV. In contrast, EMCA(dd) of FePc/O-Cu(110)
changes sign quickly as seen in Fig. 3(d); it becomes negative at !! − !!! ≈ 0.4 eV,
where the Fermi level moves to above the eg state in the minority spin channel [cf. Fig.
2(b)]. Interestingly, EMCA(uu) and EMCA(ud+du) of FePc/O-Cu(110) cancel each other
within the range -0.5 eV < !! − !!! < 1.0 eV, although their absolute amplitudes are
even larger than that of EMCA(dd). As a consequence, EMCA(dd) plays the dominant
role in the substrate-induced SRT. In addition, EMCA solely originates from the SOC
effect of the Fe atom for the free FePc molecule, as suggested by the perfect overlap
between bold-solid line (SOC contributions from all atoms were included) and the
shaded region (SOC of only the Fe atom was included) in Fig. 3(c). The overlap
becomes less perfect for FePc/O-Cu(110) in Fig. 3(d), because of the minor
contributions from the SOC effect of Cu atoms in the substrate.

Figure 4. (a) PDOS of the Fe eg orbital of FePc/Cu(110) under different electric
fields. A positive ε is defined as pointing from the molecule to the substrate. The inset
shows the field induced charge redistribution: Δρ = ρ(ε=-1.0 V/Å) – ρ(ε=0). The
atomic symbols and color scale of the charge density are the same as that in Fig. 2(c).
(b) MS and EMCA of FePc/O-Cu(110) as a function of ε.
Note that EMCA of FePc/O-Cu(110) changes rapidly near !! − !!! = 0, with a
positive slope as shown in Fig. 3(d). This offers an opportunity to tune the magnetic
anisotropy of FePc/O-Cu(110) by applying an electric field (ε). Here, we define the
electric field pointing downward to the surface as positive. Since the screening in the
region between the molecule and the substrate is rather weak, the electronic potential
around the FePc molecule may easily shift to lower (higher) value with respect to the
substrate by a positive (negative) EEF, and so do the PDOS peaks of Fe-3d orbitals.
The electric field dependence of the Fe-eg peak was used as example in Fig. 4(a). It
appears that the magnitude of the energy shift with ε = -1.0 V/Å is larger than that
with ε = 1.0 V/Å. The presence of EEF alters the electron population of the FePc
molecule and also its magnetic moment, as shown in Fig. 4(b). At ε = +1.0 V/Å, the
Bader charge of FePc molecule becomes -0.66e, compared to +0.43e for the zero-field
case. When ε is -1.0 V/Å, the Bader charge of FePc molecule is +1.39e.

The inset

in Fig. 4(a) shows that a negative EEF causes charge depletion from the Fe-eg state to

"

the substrate. The large range of MS in Fig. 4(b), from 1.15 µB at ε = +1.0 V/Å to 3.24
µB at ε = -1.0 V/Å, suggests a giant magnetoelectric effect in FePc/O-Cu(110).
It is interesting that the calculated EMCA(ε) curve in Fig. 4(b) closely follows the
trend of EMCA(!! − !!! ) in Fig. 3(d), as predicted by the rigid band model analysis.
On the positive side of ε, EMCA first increases to its summit at ε =0.25 V/Å and then
drops gradually afterward. For negative ε, EMCA decreases rapidly and changes its sign
near ε = -0.5 V/Å. This is caused by electron depletion from the Fe-eg orbital as well
as by the involvement of Cu-d states as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). This
EEF-induced SRT is very important for magnetic recording and spintronics
applications since one has a means to switch the easy axis of FePc/O-Cu(110)
between the in-plane and perpendicular direction.
In summary, structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the FePc molecule
on the O-Cu(110) surface have been systematically studied through density functional
theory calculations. We have shown that the FePc molecule forms a strong ionic Fe-O
bond with the substrate, even though the adsorption energy is small. In this system,
the charge transfer is the main cause for the substrate induced SRT, according to both
second-order perturbation analysis and rigid band model calculations. Intriguingly, we
found that the spin orientation of FePc/O-Cu(110) is switchable by applying a
negative external electric field. Our studies pave a way for the mechanism-based
design of molecular spintronics devices.

" It should be noted that the Bader’s charge transfer discussed here should not be

regarded quantitatively as the charge state in conventional chemistry. Actually it
describes the charge redistribution within spheres with certain radii (the Wigner-Seitz
radii of atoms). "

Cu(110) substrate is marked. (b) Projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe-3d orbitals
with different U corrections as well as vdW-DF corrections. (c) The magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy (EMCA) (black dots) and spin moment (MS) (red triangles) of α/O
FePc/O-Cu(110) as functions of U. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the
corresponding values of vdW-DF calculations.
We explored the effect of Hubbard U correction on our results, with U=1-4 eV for the
Fe-3d orbitals. The atomic structures were re-optimized but no notable change was found
from GGA results. Furthermore, GGA+U calculations do not change the site preference
of FePc on O-Cu(110). For example, the energy difference between α/O and α/Cu
geometries with the GGA+U correction is 0.14 eV, very close to the corresponding GGA
result, 0.17 eV.
The inclusion of U causes shifts of energy levels, as shown for the α/O geometry in
Fig. S1(b). The occupied b2g and eg orbitals and unoccupied b1g orbital are pushed
downwards, whereas the unoccupied eg orbital are pushed upwards. Furthermore, the
electron occupancy of the eg orbital decreases as the value of U increases. As a result, the
spin moment of FePc/O-Cu(110) increases monotonically with U, as seen in Fig. S1(c).
Meanwhile, EMCA decreases in magnitude, due to the increases of the denominators in Eq.
4 in the text. Significantly, the sign of EMCA for the α/O geometry keeps positive for U up
to 4 eV, so the substrate induced spin reorientation as discussed in the text is unaffected
by the U-term.
Considering that the measured MS of FePc/O-Cu(110) is 2.30±0.02 µB, [Error!%
Bookmark' not' defined.] we believe that GGA is more appropriate for the description of
electronic and magnetic properties of FePc/O-Cu(110). The molecular orbitals are rather
delocalized due to the intermixing with N-p orbitals. Therefore, the on-site Coulomb
interactions should not significant in FePc/O-Cu(110) and the Hubbard U correction is
actually unnecessary.
