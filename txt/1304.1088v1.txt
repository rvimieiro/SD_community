Abstract
Kutat61 is a system that takes as input a
database of cases and produces a belief net­
work that captures many of the dependence
relations represented by those data. This
system incorporates a module for determining
the entropy of a belief network and a module
for constructing belief networks based on
entropy calculations. Kutat6 constructs an
initial belief network in which all variables
in the database are assumed to be marginally
independent. The entropy of this belief net­
work is calculated, and that arc is added
that minimizes the entropy of the resulting
belief network. Conditional probabilities for
an arc are obtained directly from the data­
base. This process continues until an entropy­
based threshold is reached. We have tested
the system by generating databases from net­
works using the probabilistic logic-sampling
method, and then using those databases as
input to Kutat6. The system consistently
reproduces the original belief networks with
high fidelity.

Introduction

Computer-based information processing
has changed dramatically since the construc­
tion of the first computers. From its inception
as an arithmetic discipline, the field has
evolved to provide sophisticated means for
increasing our understanding of nature. This
evolution has been made possible by the
availability of increasingly sophisticated
hardware and software, and has been driven
by the rapid growth of information from

Kutat6 means "explorer" or "investigator"
in Hungarian.

experiments. Data are being generated so
rapidly in some fields that manual or even
semiautomated methods of data analysis
cannot keep pace, resulting in databases that
remain unexplored.
Researchers have explored databases for
several reasons, most notably to discover and
to validate knowledge [Walker, 1990]; here,
we focus on the automated or semiautomated
construction of probabilistic expert systems, a
form of knowledge discovery. In particular,
we address the problem of constructing a
Bayesian belief network, herein referred to
as a belief network, from a database. We
direct the reader to [Cooper, 1989; Horvitz,
1988] for introductions to belief networks and
their relation to other expert-system para­
digms; to [Ross, 1984] and to [Jaynes, 1982;
Levine, 1978] for introductions to the concepts
of entropy and maximum entropy, respec­
tively; to [Cohen, 1982; Michalski, 1983;
Michalski, 1986] for discussions of machine
learning based on artificial-intelligence
techniques; to [Glymour, 1987] for an analysis
of the determination of causal structure based
on statistical methods; and to [Breiman, 1984]
for a discussion of discovering associations
among variables by recursive partitioning of
a data set.
Many of the numerical algorithms for
database exploration have their roots in
information theory; in particular, they share
a foundation on the principle of maximum
entropy [Jaynes, 1982]; the entropy of a
distribution is calculated using the equation

H=-'IPi logPi.
where Pi corresponds to an element in the
full joint distribution (there would be 2n terms
for a distribution based on n binary

55

variables). The maximum-entropy principle
is invoked when there is insufficient infor­
mation to determine a full joint distribution
unambiguously. The principle states that, in
the absence of prior information about the
distribution, by choosing the full joint distri­
bution that has maximum entropy given the
information at hand, we guarantee that
probabilities derived from the resulting dis­
tribution will have no bias. This result is
unique to the principle of maximum entropy;
imposing any other constraints (such as that
of a particular distribution class) on the data
may introduce biases.
From the perspective of reconstructing a
probability distribution from a database,
researchers have employed the principle of
maximum entropy by treating the cases in a
database as constraints on an underlying dis­
tribution; since most databases have far
fewer cases than elements in the correspond­
ing full joint distribution, the latter is
severely underconstrained. Algorithms using
this principle return a list of probabilities
from the database that, taken together, rep­
resent all the interdependence in the underly­
ing full joint distribution; that is, any proba­
bilities in the full joint distribution not in the
list may be calculated from those in the list,
since the list is assumed to capture all signifi­
cant dependencies among variables. For ex­
ample, if the list consisted solely of first­
order probabilities, all higher-order proba­
bilities could be calculated as products of
these first-order probabilities. In addition to
its use in estimating distributions, entropy
calculation has been used to perform proba­
bilistic inference [Wen, 1988] and to generate
production rules from a database [Chan, 1989;
Cheeseman, 1983; Gevarter, 1986; Goodman,

1989].
Researchers first used entropy-based
methods for database exploration . as a
byproduct of investigating the more general
problem of generating a parsimonious proba­
bility distribution that best approximates a
known underlying distribution. Lewis [Lewis
II, 1959] described an algorithm for approxi­
mating an nth-order binary distribution as a
product of lower-order distributions, based on
the closeness metric:

2"-1

p.

lp.p= }:.Pj ln-!-,

which is also known as the Kullback-Liebler
cross-entropy measure [Kullback, 1951]. This

The algorithm searches a strongly

restricted subset of possible approximating
distributions P' (those that have the same
lower-order joint probabilities as those of the
true distribution P), and chooses the distribu­
tion that minimizes the closeness metric.
Chow and Liu [Chow, 1968] considered
the approximation of an nth-order distribu­
tion with n - 1 second-order distributions,
using Lewis' closeness metric. In this algorithm only

{�)

numbers need to be deter­

mined; they correspond to pairwise associa­
tions, and are added incrementally until the
n - 1 strongest have been included, at which
time the program terminates. Although this
algorithm is relatively efficient computa­
tionally, it is highly restricted in that only
those approximating distributions composed
of second-order probabilities are considered.
Ku and Kullback [Ku, 1969] generalized
Chow and Liu's algorithm, allowing any
lower-order marginal distributions to be used
in approximating an nth-order distribution.
A convergent iterative formula is used to
determine the distribution given a set of
lower-order marginal constraints. As ex­
pected, the algorithm converges on increas­
ingly accurate approximations as the order of
the marginal distributions is increased; this
accuracy is obtained at the cost of running
times and data requirements that are expo­
nential in the order of the approximating dis­
tribution, as each element of that distribution
must be estimated with the convergent itera­
tive algorithm.

An algorithm developed by Cheeseman
[Cheeseman, 1983] and augmented by
Gevarter [Gevarter, 1986] maximizes the
entropy of a distribution given only first­
order constraints obtained from data. The
algorithm searches for significant constraints
heuristically, in contrast to the iterative,
exhaustive methods used by previous
workers. A significance test is employed to

determine whether the second-order proba­
bilities derived from the database are signif­
icantly different from those obtained from
the maximum-entropy distribution. If they
are, the most extreme deviant (itself a sec­
ond-order probability) is added to the set of
constraints, and an enhanced maximum­
entropy distribution is computed. This pro­
cess continues until no further second-order
constraints are significant; the algorithm
then continues to test third- and higher-order
constraints until there remain no statistically
significant differences between the distribu­
tion computed from maximum-entropy consid­
erations and that derived from the database.
In summary, this procedure represents a
myopic search progressing from the lowest­
order constraints to the highest-order con­
straints embodied in the database, and uses a
significance test at each step to determine
whether any probabilities in the database
are different from their expected values
given the constraints already found.
Because the general methods of Ku and
Kullback and of Cheeseman and Gevarter
rely on iterative algorithms and have run­
ning times that are exponential in the order
of the approximating distribution, re­
searchers sought to bring other computational
techniques to bear on the problem of con­
structing a probabilistic expert system from
data.
Pearl [Pearl, 1988) discussed the
separation of what he called structure learn­
ing, determining a dependency model for a
probability distribution, and para m e t er
learning, determining the probabilities that
complete that model. From this perspective,
the algorithm developed by Chow and Liu
returns a dependence tree, which is a span­
ning tree representing all significant pairwise
correlations among variables, and a set of sec­
ond-order probabilities for each (undirected)
arc in that tree.
Pearl also described a
method whereby a polytree could be extract­
ed from a probability distribution using cal­
culations similar to those specified by Chow
and Liu in addition to partial structure deter­
minations based on tests of conditional
independence.
This algorithm, although
more general than that described by Chow
and Liu, is not guaranteed to find the best
polytree-based approximation to an arbi-

trary distribution; furthermore, the algo­
rithm cannot return nontree structures.
Extending the distinction between struc­
ture and parameter learning, Spiegelhalter
and Lauritzen [Spiegelhalter, 1989] main­
tained that structure learning should occur
only in the presence of a domain expert, and
described a method for using data to update
the conditional probabilities in a belief net­
work whose structure has been specified by an
expert. The method is based on local- and
global-independence assumptions; the former
allows the algorithm to individually para­
meterize each particular conditional-prob­
ability distribution for a node given a
particular instantiation of its parents, and
the latter allows the algorithm to compute
the belief network's distribution as the prod­
uct of the distributions for each node. The
authors use a Dirichlet distribution to
parameterize the conditional-probability
distributions parsimoniously and to provide a
basis for locally updating these conditional­
probability functions via approximations to
the resulting finite-mixture distributions.
The strong independence assumptions and
updating heuristics allow incremental updat­
ing of the conditional probabilities (that is,
on a case-by-case basis), at the cost of main­
taining the network structure constant over
time, and with the restriction that these
techniques be applied only to domains that
manifest global and local independence.
In contrast to the approach of
Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen regarding auto­
mated parameter determination, Srinivas,
Russell, and Agogino [Srinivas, 1989] posited
that a system that can learn structure from
data or other constraints might alleviate the
knowledge-acquisition bottleneck.
They
developed an algorithm that takes as input
some qualitative information from an expert
about the dependencies in the domain, and
returns a belief network incorporating these
constraints. No attempt is made to use data
to compute conditional probabilities; only the
structure is determined. The expert-derived
information about a variable or set of vari­
ables may be stated in any one of four forms:
•

A variable X is a root node, or hypothesis
variable

57

•

•

•

A variable
variable

X

is a leaf node, or evidence

A variable X is a direct predecessor, or
parent, of Y (that is, X causes Y)

Variable sets X and Y are conditionally
independent given set Z

The algorithm applies a priority heuristic to
each node, adding hypotheses, causes,
effects, and evidence nodes to the nascent
belief network in that order; it breaks ties by
adding the node that would bring with it the
fewest arcs. This process continues until all
nodes have been added to the network. The
algorithm's computational complexity is
exponential in the number of nodes, does not
use data, and does not compute conditional
probabilities, although in principle the last
two issues could be addressed with extensions
to the algorithm.

2.

The Kutat6 Algorithm

We have developed an algorithm, called
Kutat6, that, given a database, returns a
belief network. Kutat6 determines the net­
work's structure by beginning with the
assumption of marginal independence among
all variables, and by adding the arc that
maintains acyclicity and results in a belief
network with minimal entropy. We attempt
to minimize entropy since we are approaching
the maximum-entropy distribution from
above. The arc-addition step represents an
attempt to find the association that most
strongly constrains the ensuing distribution.
As an arc is added, the database is used to
update the conditional-probability distribu­
tion for the node at the head of the new arc.
Arcs are added in this manner until a thresh­
old is reached in the rate of decrease of the
entropy between two successive networks.
Consider an n-node model; since any two nodes
may in principle be associated, O(n2) arcs are
considered before the best one to add (if any)
is chosen; further, since in principle all these
associations may be found to be significant,
this cycle is repeated 0(n2) times, resulting in
a complexity (not including entropy calcula­
tions) of 0(n4).
Directions of arcs are dictated by a total
order on variables in the database, although
the alternative of having the algorithm
choose arc directions based on entropy mini-

mization is also available to the user.
Kutat6 obtains the total order from a domain
expert by having him answer the question,
"For the two variables A and B, which one
cannot cause the other?" for each pair of
variables (A, B) in the database. (If the
answer is not known, a random order may be
assigned.) This procedure obviates complex
reasoning about causality, results in a more
intuitively appearing belief network, and
provides a relatively simple and efficient
method for obtaining rudimentary causal
knowledge; yet, it is not required. Indeed, the
user might supply an order resulting in a more
highly connected network than would have
resulted without any causal information.
Thus, in some cases, there may be a tradeoff
between choosing the directions of the arcs
and decreasing the interconnectedness of the
final network.

2.1 The Entropy-Computation Algorithm
Given that inference in belief networks is
NP-hard [Cooper, 1987], it is not surprising to
find that the problem of determining the
entropy of an arbitrary probability distribu­
tion is NP-Hard [Cooper, 1990a]. Just as other
workers have exploited the principle of con­
ditional independence to increase greatly the
efficiency of inference, we have developed an
algorithm that exploits the conditional
independence embodied in a belief network to
compute its distribution's entropy. Using this
algorithm is much more efficient than is
summing over the full joint distribution,
which makes this project feasible. As dis­
cussed in Section 2, in the worst cases, the
entropy calculations must be performed 0(n4>
times, thus making the overall complexity of
Kutat6 0(n4 2"). We emphasize that this
upper bound on complexity represents the
worst case, wherein each node is directly con­
nected to every other node. We expect many
realistic models to be sparsely connected, and
indeed, this has been our experience.
The formula for calculating the entropy
of a distribution represented by a belief net­
work is based on the concept of conditional
entropy [Ross, 1984]. Let U be the set of nodes
in a belief network BN; for any node X E U,
let ll x be the set of its parents (direct prede­
cessors}, and let 1rx be a particular instantia-

tion of the parents of X. The entropy of the
distribution represented by BN is

I

where

HBN = L, L,P(flx= trx )HXlnx'

"
These formulas state that we can calculate the entropy of a distribution represented
by a belief network by weighting each node's
conditional entropy given a particular instan­
tiation of that node's parents by the joint
probability of the parents' assuming those
values. We implemented a modified version
of this formula using Cooper's recursive
decomposition algorithm [Cooper, 1990b].
With this implementation, we can compute
the entropy of ALARM [Beinlich, 1989]-a
belief network with 37 nodes, 46 arcs, and
approximately 1017 elements in its joinf dis­
tribution-in less than 10 seconds. Con­
ditional independence provides the computa­
tional leverage that allows this calculation
to be performed efficiently.
2.2 The Significance Test

I

Each cycle of the algorithm yields a set
of O(n2) entropy measures corresponding to
the individual additions of each possible
remaining arc. A function is needed as a
means of determining the best arc to add, or
whether the program should halt. We chose
to test for significance using the change in
entropy of the underlying distribution,
because entropy is sensitive to bias, and
because we can formulate a straightforward
significance test based on entropy changes, as
shown in (Jaynes, 1982]. Jaynes demonstrated
that the test statistic 2NL1H, where N is the
number of cases used to update the network,
and tJ.H is the difference in entropy that
results from adding an arc to the network, is

I

asymptotically (as N � oo) distributed as
chi-squared. We can use this result in con­
structing a significance test.

I

For each arc considered during a cycle of
the algorithm, we compute the probability
that the distribution represented by the
belief network including the arc is the same
as the distribution of that network without
the arc. Computing the entropy difference
between the two networks, we can employ a

chi-squared test with the appropriate
degrees of freedom. We then have, for each
arc, a probability that that arc's addition
makes no difference in the underlying distri­
butions; this result corresponds to conditional
independence. By choosing the arc with the
lowest probability of manifesting conditional
independence, we maximize the probability
that this arc should be added to the belief
network.
2.3 The Dirichlet Distribution

Any classification or exploration system
must have a method for managing incomplete
information. In particular, systems that
examine databases for interdependence
among variables are plagued by the problem
of overfitting of the data. For example, a
data set could be partitioned into so many
elements that each unique case is grouped
alone; this result is equivalent to maintaining
the full joint distribution, which is unwieldy.
Furthermore, in some sense, overclassification
can be viewed as an algorithm's overconfi­
dence in how well the data represent the
underlying distribution.
Most databases
have far fewer cases than they have ele­
ments in the corresponding full joint distribu­
tion, so this distribution is severely undercon­
strained. Here is another case where the
maximum-entropy principle could be em­
ployed, yet it is prohibitively expensive
computationally to compute the entropy of a
database. It would be much more convenient
to compute the entropy of a belief network
derived from a database.
As an alternative, we can consider the
database to represent a sample from an
infinitely exchangeable multinomial se­
quence; we can then use symmetric Dirichlet
prior probabilities for computing conditional
probabilities [Zabell, 1982]. In particular, for
node X having Vx values, parents llx, and
considering a particular instantiation of
those parents trx, we compute the correspond­
ing conditional probability with the follow­
ing formula:

C(X=x,ll x= trx)+ 1
P(X=x I ll x=nx)=
c(nx=nx l+ v x ,
where C(«l») is the number of cases that match
the instantiated set of variables «1».

59

The use of such prior probabilities
addresses several problems. When we are
attempting to determine the conditional
probabilities for an arc that is not repre­
sented in the database, the principle of max­
imum entropy, if applied locally, would gen­
erate a uniform distribution for these condi­
tional probabilities; this result also follows
when we use the Dirichlet distribution. In
addition, this method allows Kutat6 to han­
dle incomplete data. Only those cases that
can update the conditional-probability table
are used; if none exist, a default uniform dis­
tribution results. Using Dirichlet prior prob­
abilities further results in a natural halt to
overspecification: When a uniform condi­
tional-probability distribution is generated
(due to an absence of relevant cases), the
entropy of the belief network will rise, lead­
ing to prompt rejection of the corresponding
arc. Indeed, this effect is also observed when
the number of relevant cases is small, since
the resulting distribution will still be
approximately uniform.
3.

lles�ts2

We tested Kutat6 by acquiring a belief
network, generating a database of cases with
the probabilistic logic-sampling method
[Henrion, 1988], and then using that database
as input to Kutat6. The first belief network
tested was MCBNl, a binary network of five
nodes and five arcs (see Figure 1); its full joint
distribution thus has 32 elements, and the
probabilities in that distribution range from
0.0002 4 to 0.46656. Because this distribution
has few elements, we were able to test the
Kutat6 with the exact full joint distribution,
the equivalent of an infinite database,
instead of data. Kutat6 returned MCBNl
exactly, in 13 seconds. We then used logic
sampling to generate a database of 1000 com­
plete cases. Kutat6 generated MCBN1's
structure exactly in less than 1 minute (two­
thirds of this time was spent reading the
database), and all of the conditional proba­
bilities (ranging from 0.1 to 0.9) were accurate
to within 0.04.

The software was implemented and
evaluated on a Macintosh II using
Lightspeed Pascal v. 2.0.

We next tested the ALARM belief network
(see Figure 2), using a database of 10,000 com­
plete cases. The resulting network was gener­
ated in approximately 22.5 hours (one-fourth
of which was spent reading the database); it
is shown in Figure 3. The program added 46
arcs before halting (the original version of
ALARM also has 46 arcs). Two arcs of 46 were
missing, and two extra arcs were added.

Future llesearch

We will apply Kutat6 to a series of
databases in a variety of domains. We also
will investigate the system's behavior in the
face of increasingly sparse data. Several
other possible extensions to this work include:

A probabilistic reformulation of this
work. One such algorithm, K2, has been
developed by Cooper, and is being inves­
tigated by the authors.
Preliminary
results indicate that, compared to
Kutat6, this algorithm runs faster and is
more robust to noise.
A version of K2 based on continuous dis­
tributions. A version based on the multi­
variate Gaussian distribution would com­
plement Shachter's work on Gaussian
influence diagrams [Shachter, 1989].
Modifications of the greedy search used
for arc addition. For example, several
arcs could be added at a time, or arcs
could be deleted.

Delineation of a constraint language. It
should be capable of expressing expert­

among variables in the database. This
language would greatly extend the sys­
tem's expressiveness beyond the current
total order used to determine the
direction of arcs. 1<2, unlike Kutat6, can
incorporate prior probabilities over pos­
sible networks; thus, we will apply this
language to K2.

Conclusion

Kutat6 is an efficient system for approx­
imating the maximum-entropy distribution of
a database. It is applicable in the presence of
missing data, noisy data (such as those
obtained from probabilistic logic-sampling),
and immense joint-probability spaces. The
algorithm makes use of the conditional inde­
pendence manifested in a belief network to
streamline computation, enabling us to run the
program on readily available hardware. A
new, probabilistic version of this algorithm
show even greater promise for constructing
probabilistic networks from data.
