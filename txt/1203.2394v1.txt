Abstract
The decentralized particle filter (DPF) was proposed recently to increase the level of parallelism of particle filtering. Given a decomposition of the state space into two nested sets of
variables, the DPF uses a particle filter to sample the first set and then conditions on this sample to generate a set of samples for the second set of variables. The DPF can be understood
as a variant of the popular Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF), where the second step
is carried out using Monte Carlo approximations instead of analytical inference. As a result,
the range of applications of the DPF is broader than the one for the RBPF. In this paper, we
improve the DPF in two ways. First, we derive a Monte Carlo approximation of the optimal
proposal distribution and, consequently, design and implement a more efficient look-ahead DPF.
Although the decentralized filters were initially designed to capitalize on parallel implementation, we show that the look-ahead DPF can outperform the standard particle filter even on a
single machine. Second, we propose the use of bandit algorithms to automatically configure the
state space decomposition of the DPF.

Introduction

Without a doubt, Rao-Blackwellization has proved to be the most successful technique for enabling
particle filters to solve high-dimensional dynamic inference problems, see for example [1, 2, 3, 4]
and the many citations to those papers. When applying Rao-Blackwellization to particle filtering,
one decomposes the state space into two groups of variables. The first group of variables is sampled
with a particle filter. Then one conditions on these samples to compute the sufficient statistics of
the second group of variables analytically. If a decomposition exists such that the dimension of
the sampled variables is small while the dimension of the analytical variables is large, then one can
effectively solve high dimensional problems. An example of this, of great practical relevance, is the
application of RBPFs to jump-Markov linear Gaussian systems [5, 6, 7, 8].
These works have however left open some important questions: (i) What happens if there is no
analytical expression for the distribution of the second group of variables? (ii) Is there a reason
for deriving an approximate Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) in this case? (iii) Instead of

only two groups of variables, can one use successive nesting of more than two groups? (iv) How do
we decompose the state space automatically?
Chen et. al. (2011) have recently provided answers to questions (i) and (ii). They designed a
new particle filter, which they named the Decentralized Particle Filter (DPF), that is effectively
an RBPF, but with the difference that the distribution of the second group of variables is also
approximated by a conditional particle filter. That is, one uses a particle filter to sample the first
group and then conditions on these samples to sample the second group with a conditional particle
filter. They provide an important reason for doing this: increased parallelization.
The resampling step is one of the computational bottlenecks in parallel implementations of
particle filters in graphics processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
[10, 11, 12]. By decomposing the state space, the DPF allows for more efficient, local in the state
space, resampling. Chen and colleagues have demonstrated this advantage of DPFs over standard
PFs. Moreover, with increased interest in the deployment of particle filters for large scale applications, such as the analysis of streaming news [13], algorithms that capitalize on decompositions of
the space space are of great research interest.
Chen et. al. suggest the use of Gaussian approximations in order to manage computation. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to avoid these Gaussian approximations without significant
loss of performance. Moreover, we show that it is possible to obtain a pure Monte Carlo approximation of the optimal importance distribution (optimal proposal). This Monte Carlo approximation
enables us to design and implement a look-ahead filter, where the sampling and resampling steps
can be swapped. In the context of exact Rao-Blackwellization, this look-ahead strategy is described
in detail in [5] and was first suggested in [1]. In [5], it was clear that the look-ahead RBPF performed significantly better than the PF and RBPF algorithms in practical domains. In our context,
the derivation of a look-ahead strategy is a bit more tricky as it involves additional Monte Carlo
approximations. However, as we will see in the experiments, the look-ahead strategy still results
in substantial improvements over the standard DPF.
Our final contribution is to answer, to some extent and for the first time, question (iv). This
question was posed more than ten years ago and continues appearing in the future work sections
of papers on the topic, including the DPF paper. Our solution involves the usage of online bandit
algorithms [14] to decide the order in which variables should be sampled. Question (iii) is still open,
but we conjecture that the improvements introduced in [9] and here will lead to it being answered
in the near future.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the models, poses the inference problems,
and provides a brief description of the DPF. The section ends with a description of the proposed
look ahead (LA)-DPF algorithm. Section 3 presents the automatic state decomposition strategy.
The PF, DPF and LA-DPF are compared in the experiments of Section 4. We conclude the paper
in Section 5.

Decentralized Particle Filter

The state space is decomposed into two groups of variables (xt ∈ X ⊆ Rnx , zt ∈ Z ⊆ Rnz ), which
are governed by the following latent, dynamic state space model with observations yt ∈ Y ⊆ Rny :
xt+1 = ftx (xt , zt , vtx )
zt+1 = ftz (xt:t+1 , zt , vtz )

(1)

yt = ht (xt , zt , et ),
where xt:t+1 = (xt , xt+1 ), vt = (vtx , vtz ) and et are noise processes, and f (·) and h(·) are nonlinear
mappings. This model can be equivalently expressed in terms of the initial distributions p(x0 ) and
p(z0 |x0 ), the transition distributions p(xt+1 |xt , zt ) and p(zt+1 |xt:t+1 , zt ) and the observation model
p(yt |xt , zt ). We assume that the parameters of these distributions are known and focus on the
inference problem.
The goal of inference is to recursively estimate the posterior distribution p(zt , x0:t |y0:t ). Using
the following factorization:
p(zt , x0:t |y0:t ) = p(zt |x0:t , y0:t )p(x0:t |y0:t ),

(2)

with x0:t = (x0 , . . . , xt ), this filtering problem can be split into the two nested subproblems of
recursively estimating (1) p(x0:t |y0:t ) and (2) p(zt |x0:t , y0:t ). The way in which these subproblems
interact with each other is depicted in Figure 1. The diagram shows the necessary steps for
implementing the optimal filter in this nested setting. However, except in very specific cases,
there is no analytic solution to this filtering problem. Therefore, a numerical algorithm must be
employed. The DPF is one such algorithm. It handles the two nested subproblems using particle
filters: subproblem 1 is dealt with using a PF with Nx particles, and subproblem 2 is dealt with
using Nx PFs with Nz particles each. The DPF solves these two nested subproblems in 7 steps [9],
as illustrated in Figure 2. We only give a brief overview of the main steps of the DPF and state
the important equations required for deriving our look-ahead DPF algorithm. We refer the reader
to [9] for all the mathematical details involved in deriving the DPF algorithm and to [15] for an
introduction to particle filtering.
We describe the 7 steps briefly. Assume that we have Monte Carlo approximations of the

However, unlike in simple Markov processes, we cannot exploit conditional independence in a trivial
manner so as to simplify the numerator. Instead, we express the quantities in the numerator in
terms of the following marginals
Z
p(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 ) =
p(xt |xt−1 , zt−1 )p(zt−1 |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 )dzt−1
Z
p(yt |x0:t , y0:t−1 ) =
p(yt |xt , zt )p(zt |x0:t , y0:t−1 )dzt
and approximate them with the following Monte Carlo estimates:

The first expression is a simple Monte Carlo estimate obtained by replacing p(zt−1 |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 )
(i)
with its approximation pNz (zt−1 |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 ). In the second expression, we use importance sampling to approximate the integral. In particular, we assume that we have already computed the

importance weight r̃t , defined as follows:

(6)

(i)

where z̃t
are samples from the proposal mechanism π(zt |x̃0:t , y0:t−1 ). Note that to compute this
(i,j) (i)
importance weight, we require an expression for p̃Nz (z̃t |x̃0:t , y0:t−1 ). To achieve this, we need to
first obtain expressions for p(zt |x0:t , y0:t ) and p(zt |x0:t+1 , y0:t ).
Using Bayes rule and conditional independence, we have:
(i)

(i)

(i)

p(zt |x0:t , y0:t ) ∝ p(zt |x0:t , y0:t−1 )p(yt |xt , zt ).

Since π(zt |x̃0:t , y0:t−1 ) is the proposal mechanism from which the samples z̄t

A Monte Carlo approximation of this quantity results in the expression necessary for computing

Note that in contrast to what is done in [9], no further approximation of (4) will be made in
the remainder of the derivation. We refer the reader to the results section for more details on this.
In the algorithm, shown in Figure 2, the weights q̄t−1 and r̃t were computed in steps 3 and
7 respectively. Steps 2 and 6 are standard resampling steps [15]. One has to be careful keeping
tracks of indices, tildes and bars, but aside from this, the algorithm follows easily from the standard
importance sampling steps for particle filtering.

2.1

On the choice of proposal distribution

A common practice is to use the prior distributions as proposal distributions:
(i)

(i)

π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) = p(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 )
and

(i)

(i)

π(zt |x0:t , y0:t ) = p(zt |x0:t , y0:t−1 ).
These proposals are both intuitive and reduce the complexity of the derivations considerably. However, they do not take into account the current observation yt . The original DPF algorithm uses
these prior proposal distributions. However, a better choice of proposal for xt that takes into
account the current observation yt is given by:
(i)

(i)

π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) = p(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ).
6

It can be shown that this importance distribution is optimal [16].
Using Bayes rule, the optimal proposal distribution can be written as:
(i)

(i)

p(yt |x0:t−1 , xt , y0:t−1 )p(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 )

(i)

π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) =

(i)

p(yt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 )

.

(9)

This expression results in the following simplification of the importance weights for x:
(i)

wt =

p(x0:t |y0:t )
p(yt |x0:t , y0:t−1 )p(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t−1 )
(i)
∝
= p(yt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 ).
π(x0:t |y0:t )
π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t )
(i)

The predictive distribution p(yt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 ) can be expanded as follows:
ZZ
(i)
(i)
(i)
p(yt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 ) =
p(yt |xt , zt )p(zt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 , xt )p(xt |y0:t−1 , x0:t−1 )dxt dzt
(i)

(i)

Note that wt does not depend on the value of the sample drawn from π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ).
The optimal importance density suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires the ability to
(i)
sample from π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) and to evaluate the integral over the new states in the calculation of
the importance weights. In general, both of these steps are hard. There are two cases when the
(i)
use of the optimal importance density is possible: when π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) is a member of a finite
(i)

set, e.g. a jump-Markov linear system [1], or when π(xt |x0:t−1 , y0:t ) is Gaussian [16].
In our case, we can use the Monte Carlo estimates (4) and (5) to obtain an approximation of

The cost of the algorithm is Nx × Nz . Since X and Z are lower dimensional than X × Z, the hope
is that Nx × Nz is still lower than the the number of particles N required by a standard particle
filter on the joint space X × Z. Moreover, since typically Nx and Nz are much smaller than N , the
resampling steps of the DPF are much cheaper than usual O(N ) cost of the standard PF. This can
therefore result in significant computational gains when parallelizing the algorithm for real-time
applications.

2.2

Look-ahead DPF algorithm

As mentioned in [5], one more improvement is possible when using the optimal proposal distribution.
The optimal importance weights don’t depend on xt or zt , as we are in fact marginalizing over these
variables. Therefore, we can swap the resampling and proposal steps. This enables us to resample
(select the fittest) particles at time t − 1 using information from the future time t. We refer the
reader to Figure 3 for an intuitive diagram highlighting the benefits of this. Figure 4 illustrates the
4 steps of the look-ahead DPF algorithm.

the PF, starting with the resampled particles at t−1, a new set of particles is proposed at time t. We compute
the importance weight of each particle. Finally, we select the fittest particles according to their weights. Note
the PF has failed to track the two modes appearing on the right of the filtering posterior distribution at time
t. On the other hand, for the look-ahead filter, we first compute the importance weights. After resampling
according to these weights, we propose new particles at time t. With this algorithm, we are more likely to
propose particles in areas of high probability.

Automatic State Decomposition

The decision of how to decompose the state space of a given system plays a dramatic role in the
performance of the DPF. In our setting, with only two nested subproblems, the decomposition
problem reduces to deciding in which order the two groups of variables should be sampled. This
order can have a large impact both on the execution time and on the overall accuracy of the
algorithm. If the system is non-stationary, the optimal order can change over time. For this reason,
we need to design algorithms to automatically choose the optimal order.
In this paper, we will adopt classical online bandit algorithms [14] to infer the sampling order.
Note that these algorithms are however applicable to the more general problem of choosing state
decompositions when splitting the state-space into more than two groups of variables.
The first algorithm we consider is Hedge (Figure 5). Hedge chooses action i (out of K possible
actions) at time t with P
probability proportional to exp(ηGi (t − 1)) where η > 0 is a memory
parameter and Gi (t) = tt0 =1 ri (t0 ) is the cumulative reward scored by action i from time 1 to t.
Actions that repeatedly yield higher rewards quickly gain a higher probability of being selected.
In our case, the actions are the different nesting orders. Different reward models are possible.
We choose the closeness of the observations to the predicted observations as the reward measure.
One drawback of Hedge is the fact that each action must be tried to pick the best action (Hedge
assumes it has full information about the rewards). This is not ideal since it introduces a large
overhead, especially when the number of actions is large. For this reason, we must introduce Exp3
[14]. Exp3 stands for ”Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation”. This
algorithm assumes it has only partial information about the reward vector. Exp3 only tries one
action at each iteration, and hence it only has information about one reward. Exp3 calls Hedge
as a subroutine. For each time interval t, Exp3 receives the probability vector p(t) from Hedge,
9

and it selects an action it according to a new distribution, p̂(t), which is a mixture of p(t) and the
uniform distribution. Using p̂(t) ensures that each action gets tried over time. After receiving the
reward rit (t) associated with the chosen action, Exp3 must simulate a full reward vector r̂(t) for
Hedge. That is, it must fill in the reward for the actions that were not tried (since Hedge requires
this information). The pseudo-code is shown in Figure 5. Both Hedge and Exp3 have vanishing
regret [14].

Simulation Results

We conduct three experiments. The first experiment compares the performance of the look-ahead
(LA)-DPF, bootstrap PF and DPF algorithms. To provide a meaningful comparison with results in
the literature, we use the model benchmarks adopted in [9]. These are summarized in Table 1. The
significant level of nonlinearity, multi-modality and non-stationarity in these models is sufficient
to cause classical filtering algorithms, such as the extended Kalman filter, to fail. The second
experiment investigates the difference between using a Gaussian approximation to evaluate (4),
as opposed to our Monte Carlo strategy. In the third experiment, we study the behaviour of the
automatic state ordering bandit methods.

Comparison between LA-DPF, DPF, and PF

The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the performance of the proposed LA-DPF algorithm
with respect to the existing DPF and standard PF algorithms. The simulations were carried out
for 250 time intervals (t = 1, . . . , 250) with a varying number of particles Nx and Nz . The accuracy
of the state estimate was measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) between the true
state and the state estimate. The results were averaged over 500 Monte Carlo simulations. As in
[9], the number of particles for the regular PF is set to Nx (Nz + 1) for meaningful comparison.

Figure 8: Comparison among the PF, DPF and LA-DPF algorithms for model 2. The plots show the RMSE
(mean and error bars) for the states x1 , x2 , z1 and z2 as a function of the number of particles. Note that
LA-DPF outperforms both DPF and PF.

(as also reported in [9]), the same is not true for LA-DPF. LA-DPF does significantly better as a
function of the number of particles. Plots (a) and (b) of Figure 7 illustrate that for the same number
of particles, the divergence rate of the DPF is higher than the one for LA-DPF. The difference is
more significant for higher Nx . All methods work well for a reasonable number of particles. Figure 7
(c) is a scatter plot for runs with multiple random Nx and Nz values. It illustrates the accuracy
versus computation time trade-off for DPF and LA-DPF. The latter can attain much lower error
than the PF and DPF variants. We should point out that both DPF and LA-DPF can equally
benefit from parallel implementation as they follow the same state-decomposition strategy to reduce
the cost of resampling. We should also note that for some transition models, the execution time of
LA-DPF could be decreased even further using kd-trees as proposed in [17].
Figures 8 and 9 are the results for Model 2, and are analogous to Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
Again, it can be seen that LA-DPF performs significantly better than PF and DPF (or at worst,
the performance is equivalent). Also, the divergence rate is much smaller for the LA-DPF than for
the DPF. Similar conclusions to the ones for Model 1 can be drawn when it comes to the accuracy
versus computation trade-off.

Comparison between DPF with Gaussian and Monte Carlo approximations

We note that in [9], a Gaussian approximation is used to estimate the proposal distribution (4). It
is however possible to use Monte Carlo approximations instead of Gaussian approximations. We
carried experiments to verify that both approaches yield similar results for the model of Table 1.
We ran the DPF with Gaussian approximation and the DPF with Monte Carlo approximation to
compare their respective RMSEs. The experiment was performed 100 times, with Nx = 100 and
Nz = 19. Table 2 shows the results. The results in terms of the RMSE are equivalent (within 1% of
one another). However, the Monte Carlo method has the advantage of being universal in the sense
that it does not require any assumption on the types of distributions that we are dealing with. It
should be expected that for non-standard noise models, Gaussian approximation could result in
very poor performance.

4.3

Automatic state decomposition for the two dimensional example

In this experiment, we use Hedge and Exp3 to choose the optimal sampling order among two actions
(action 1= sampling x first, then z, action 2 = sampling z first, then x). We tried each action
separately and verified that this ordering has a large effect on the RMSE.
α
We designed the reward function to be rit = α+
2 (0 < rit ≤ 1), where α is a small number (say
t
0.001) and t is the difference between the one-step-ahead predicted observation and the actual
observation. Other functionals of  could also work just as easily.

13

Figure 10 shows the evolution of the probability for the two actions as a function of time for
γ = 0.2 and η = 0.5 for both algorithms. The algorithms are able to converge to the action with
the lowest RMSE. As expected, Hedge converges faster and more smoothly than Exp3. However,
as the state space grows, Hedge becomes much less efficient than Exp3 because it relies on trying
every action at each time step. Therefore, Exp3 is preferred.

In another experiment, we introduce a change point at t = 600, so as to also assess whether
the bandit algorithm can adapt. For the change-point, we simply swap the transition models for
model 1. We observed the same behavior with model 2.
Figure 11 (a) shows the evolution of the probability for the two actions as a function of time
for γ = 0.2 and η = 0.5. The algorithm is able to converge to the action with the lowest RMSE.
After the change-point, the algorithm is able to gradually adapt. The rate of this adaptation is
controlled by the hyper-parameters of the control algorithm. It should be noted that we chose a
very dramatic artificial change-point, which perturbs stability of the particle filters significantly.
In practical applications we would expect more gradual model drift and, hence, better adaptation.
Plot (b) shows the action sequence for the last 100 time steps and Table (c) compares the RMSE
values incurred by Exp3 and the fixed action policies for the last 1000 time steps. As expected,
Exp3 achieves a better result than the worst action. If we know our setting is stationary, then we
can stop adapting and attain the same RMSE as the best action.

Concluding Remarks and Future Work

The DPF algorithm is a new ingenious particle filter that holds great promise. In this paper,
we proposed two algorithmic improvements: a look-ahead formulation and an automatic statedecomposition strategy. The look-ahead strategy performed remarkably well. Even though the
original motivation for the DPF was to improve the parallelization level of particle filters, our
experiments show that the look-ahead strategy works better than the widely used PF algorithm
even in a serial implementation.
In the experiments we also assessed the performance of the state-decomposition strategy using
Exp3. The simple demonstration made it clear that it is possible to use bandits to automatically
configure the filter. However, we also must point out that this set up was simple enough that
Exp3 could handle it. As we move on to more sophisticated partitioning schemes, it will become
necessary to adopt more powerful control strategies using correlated bandit strategies or Bayesian
optimization; see for example [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
The immediate future work directions are to test the look-ahead DPF on practical settings
and to carry out an empirical evaluation using GPUs. A longer term goal is to increase the level
of partitioning (having more than two levels of nesting) of the state space. How such a strategy
behaves in high-dimensions is of great interest. Another long term goal is to capitalize on the ideas
proposed here to distribute the observations across multiple cores. That is, both the states and the
observations should be decomposed for greater applicability to vast streaming datasets.
