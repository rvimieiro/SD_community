Abstract

While influence diagrams have many ad­
vantages as a representation framework for
Bayesian decision problems, they have a se­
rious drawback in handling asymmetric de­
cision problems. To be represented in an
influence diagram, an asymmetric decision
problem must be symmetrized. A consid­
erable amount of unnecessary computation
may be involved when a symmetrized influ­
ence diagram is evaluated by conventional al­
gorithms. In this paper we present an ap­
proach for avoiding such unnecessary compu­
tation in influence diagram evaluation.

INTRODUCTION

Decision trees were used as a simple tool both for prob­
lem modeling and optimal policy computation in the
early days of decision analysis (Rai'ffa 1968). A deci­
sion tree explicitly depicts all scenarios of the problem
and specifies the "utility" the agent can get in each sce­
nario. An optimal policy for a decision problem can
be computed from the decision tree representation of
the problem by a simple "average-out-and-fold-back"
method.
Though conceptually simple, decision trees have
First, the depen­
a number of drawbacks.
dency /independency relationships among the variables
in a decision problem cannot be represented in a deci­
sion tree. Second, a decision tree specifies a particular
order for the assessment on the probability distribu­
tions of the random variables in the decision problem.
This order is in most cases not a natural assessment
order. Third, the size of a decision tree for a decision
problem is exponential in the number of variables of
the decision problem. Finally, a decision tree is not
easily adaptable to changes in a decision problem. If
a slight change is made in a problem, one may have to
draw a decision tree anew.

Influence diagrams were proposed as an alternative to
decision trees for decision analysis (Howard and Math­
eson, 1984, Miller et. al. 1976). As a representation
framework, influence diagrams do not have the afore­
mentioned drawbacks of decision trees. The influence
diagram representation is expressive enough to explic­
itly describe the dependency /independency relation­
ships among the variables in the decision problem; it
allows a more natural assessment order on the proba­
bilities of the uncertain variables; it is compact; and it
is easy to adapt to the changes in the problem.
However, in comparison with decision trees, influence
diagrams have one disadvantage in representing asym­
metric decision problems (Covaliu and Oliver 1992,
Fung and Shachter 1990, Phillips 1990, Shachter 1986,
Smith et al. 1993). Decision problems are usually
asymmetric in the sense that the set of possible out­
comes of a random variable may vary depending on
different conditioning states, and the set of legitimate
alternatives of a decision variable may vary depending
on different information states. To be represented as
an influence diagram, an asymmetric decision problem
must be "symmetrized" by adding artificial states and
assuming degenerate probability distributions (Smith
et al. 1993). This symmetrization results in two prob­
lems. First, the number of information states of de­
cision variables are increased. Among the informa­
tion states of a decision variable, many are "impos­
sible" (having zero probability). The optimal choices
for these states need not be computed at all. How­
ever, they are computed by conventional influence di­
agram evaluation algorithms (Shachter 1986, Smith et
a/. 1993, Shachter and Peot 1992, Zhang and Poole
1992, Zhang et al. 1993). Second, for each informa­
tion state of a decision variable, because the legitimate
alternatives may constitute only a subset of the frame
of the decision variable, an optimal choice is chosen
from only a subset of the frame, instead of the en­
tire frame. However, conventional influence diagram
algorithms have to consider all alternative in order to
compute an optimal choice for a decision in any of its
information states. Thus, it is evident that conven­
tional influence diagram evaluation algorithms involve
unnecessary computation.

Qi, Zhang, and Poole

In this paper, we present an approach for overcom­
ing the aforementioned disadvantage of influence di­
agrams. Our approach consists of two independent
components: a simple extension to influence diagrams
and a top-down method for influence diagram evalu­
ation. Our extension allows explicitly expressing the
fact that some decision variables have different frames
in different information states. Our method, similar to
Howard and Matheson's (1984), evaluates an influence
diagram in two conceptual steps: it first maps an in­
fluence diagram into a decision tree (Qi 1994) in such
a way th at an optimal solution tree of the decision
tree corresponds to an optimal policy of the influence
diagram. Thus the problem of computing an optimal
policy is reduced to the problem of searching for an
optimal solution tree of a decision tree, which c an be
accomplished by various algorithms (Qi 1994). Like
Howard and Matheson's method, ours avoids comput­
ing optimal choices for decision variables in imp ossible
states. Furthermore, our method has two advantages
over Howard and Matheson's. First, the size of the
intermediate decision tree generated by our method
is much smaller than that generated by Howard and
Matheson's for the same influence diagram. Second,
our method provides a clean interface between in­
fluence diagram evaluation and Bayesian net evalu­
ation so that various well-established algorithms for
Bayesian net evaluation can be used in influence di­
agram evaluation. This method works for influence
diagrams with or without our extension.
The rest of th is paper is organized as follows. The
next section introduces influence diagrams. Section
3 uses an example to illustrate the disadvantage that
influence diagrams and their solution algorithms have
with asymmetric decision problems. In Section 4, we
present our approach for overcoming the disadvantage.
Section 5 gives an analysis on how much can be saved
by exploiting asymmetry in decision problems. Section
6 discusses related work and Section 7 concludes the
paper.

INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

The following definition for influence diagrams is bor­
rowed from (Zhang et a/. 1993). An influence diagram
I is defined as a quadruple I= (X, A, P,U) where
•

(X, A) is a directed acyclic graph with node set
X and arc set A. The node set X is partitioned
into random node set C, decision node set D and
value node set U . All the nodes in U have no
child.
Each decision node or random node has a set,
called the frame, asso ciated with it. The frame
of a node consists of all the possible outcomes of
the (decision or random) variable denoted by the
node. For any node x E X , we use 1r( x) to de­
note the parent set of node x in the graph and use
!.lx to denote the frame of node x . For any subset

J � C U D , we use !.lJ to denote the Cartesian
product Ilxo !.lx.
•

•

Pis a set of probability d istributions P{cl1r(c)}
for all c E C. For each o E !.lc and s E !.1.-(c), the
distribution specifies the conditional probability
of event c = o, given that1 1r(c) = s.

U is a set {gv : !.1.-(v)

---> Rlv E U} of value func­
for the value nodes, w here R is the set of
the real.

tions

For a decision node d;, a m apping 8; : !.1.-d, -+ !.ld,
is called a decision function for d;. The set of all the
decision functions for d;, denoted by ��, is called the
decision function space for d;. Let D
{d1, ..., dn} be
the set of decisi on nodes in influence diagram I. The
Cartesian product � TI�=l �� is called the policy
space of I.

For a decision node d;, a value x E !.1.-cd,) is called an
information state of d;, and a mapping 8; : n,..(d;) -+
!.ld, is called a decision function for d;. The set of all
the decision functions for d;, denoted by �;, is called
the decision function space for d;. The Cartesian prod­
uct of the decision function spaces for all the decision
nodes is called the policy space of I. We denote it by
�Given a p olicy {) = (81, ... ,8k) E �for I, a probabil­
P0 can be defined over the random nodes and the
decision nodes as follows:

follows:

otherwise

(2)

For any value node v, 1r(v) must consist of only deci­
sion and random nodes, since value nodes do not have
children. Hence, we can talk about Pc(?r(v)). The
expectation of the value node v under Pa, denoted by
Eo[v], is defined as follows:

E,�[v]

=

2: P0(7r(v))fv(7r(v)).
.-(v)

The summation Eo = I:veu E0[v] is called the value of
I under the policy 8. The maximum of Ea over all the
possible policies 8 is the optimal expected value of I.
An optimal policy is a policy that achieves the optimal
expected value. To evaluat e an influence diagram is to

determine its optimal expected value and to find an
optimal policy.
An influence is regular if there e xis ts a total ordering
among all the decision nodes. The results presented in
this paper are applicable to regular stepwise decompos­
able influence diagrams (Q i 1993, Qi and Pool e 1993,
Zhang and Poole 1992). We shall , however, limit the
exposition only to regular influence diagrams with a
single value node for simplicity.

WHY INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS
ARE NOT GOOD FOR
ASYMMETRIC DECISION
PROBLEMS

In this section, we illustrate by an example the dis­
advantages of conventional influence diagrams with
asymmetric decision problems. We use the used car
buyer problem (Howard 1962) because it is a typical
asy m metric decision problem and it has bee n used by
other researchers (Shenoy 1993, S mi t h et al. 1993).

3.1

THE USED CAR BUYER PROBLEM

Joe is considering to buy a used car. T h e marked
price is $1000, while a three years old c ar of this model

worths $1100, if it has no defect.

Joe is uncertain

whether the car is a "peach" or a "lemon". But Joe
knows that, of the ten major subsystems in the car,
a peach has a defect in only one subsystem whereas a
lemon has a defect in six subsystems. Joe also knows
that the probability for the used car being a peach is
0.8 and the probability for the car being a lemon is 0.2.
Finally, Joe knows that it will cost him $40 to repair
one defect and $200 to repair six defects.

INFLUENCE DIAGRAM
REPRESENTATION FOR THE USED
CAR BUYER PROBLEM

An influence diagram for the used car problem is
shown in Fig. 1. The random variable CC represents
the car's condition. The frame for CC has two elements:
peach and lemon. The variable h as no parent in the
graph, thus, we specify its prior probability distribu­
tion in Table 1.
The decision variable T1 represents the first test de­
CISion.
The frame for T1 has four elements: nt,
st, f&:e and tr, repr esent in g respectively the options
of performing no test, testing the steering subsystem
alone, testing the fuel and electrical subsystems, and
testing the transmission subsystem with a possibility
of testing the differential subsystem next.

The ran dom variable R1 represents the first test re­
sults. The frame for R1 has four elements: nr, zero,
one and two representing respectively the four possi­
ble outcomes of the first test: no result, no defect, one
defect and two defects. The probability distribution
of the variables, conditioned on T1 and CC, is given in
Table 2.
The de c isi on variable T2 represents the second test de­
ctswn.
Th e frame for T2 has two elem e nt s : nt and
diff, de n ot i ng the two options of performing no test
and testing the differential subsystem.
The random variable R2 represents the second test re­
sults. The frame for the random variable R2 has three
el ement s : nr, zero and one, representing respectively
the three possible outcomes of the second test: no re­
sult, no defect and one defect. The probability distri­
bution of the vari ables conditioned on T1, R1, T2 and
cc, is gi ven in Table 3.
,

The decision variable B represents the purchase deci­
sion. The frame for B h as three elements: b, b and
g, d enoting resp ectiv ely the options of not buying the
car, bu yi ng the car without the anti-lemon guarantee
and buying the car with the anti-lemon guarantee.

Observ ing Joe's concern about the pos s i bil i ty that the
car may be a lemon, the dealer offers an "anti-lemon
guarantee" option. For an additional $60, the anti­
lemon guarantee will cover the full repair cost if the
car is a lemon, and cove r half of the repair cost oth­
erwise. At the same time, a mechanic suggests that
some

mech�

examination should h€4p .J.ee..-detef­

mine the car's condition. In particular, th e mechanic
gives Joe three alternatives: test the steering subsys­
tem alone at a cost of $9 ; test the fuel and electrical
subsystems at a total cost of $13; a two-test sequence
in which, the transmission subsystem will be tested at
a cost of $10, and after knowing the test result, Joe
can decide whether to test the differential subsystem
at an additional cost of $4. All tests a re guaranteed to
detect a defect if one exists in the subsystem(s) being
tested.

The used car buyer problem is asymmetric in a num­
b er of aspects. F irst, the set of the possible outcomes
of the first test result varies, depending on the choice

then there is only one possible outcome for the first
test result - nr (representing no result). If the choice
for the first test is st or tr, then there are two possible
outcomes for the first test result- zero and one (rep­
resenting no defect and one defect, respectively). If
the choice for the first test is fl:e, then there are three
possible outcomes for the first test result -zero, one
and two (representing no defect, one defect and two
defects, respectively). However, in the influence dia­
gram representation, the frame of the variable R1 is a
common set of outcomes for all the three cases. The
impossible combinations of the test choices and the
test results are characterized by assigning zero prob­
ability to them (as shown in Table 2). A similar dis­
cussion is applicable to the variable R2. Second, from
the problem statement we know that testing differen­
tial subsystem is possible only in the states where the
first test performed is on the transmission subsystem.
However, in the influence diagram representation, it
appears that the second test is possible in any situa­
tion, while the fact that the option of testing differ­
ential subsystem is not available in some situations is
characterized by assigning unit probability to outcome
nr of the variable R2 conditioned on these situations.
Third, when we examine the information states of the
decision variable T2, we will see many combinations of
test options and test results are impossible. For ex­
ample, if Joe first tests the transmission subsystem, it
is impossible to observe nr and two. If the influence
diagram is evaluated by conventional algorithms, an
optimal choice for the second test will be computed
for each of the information states, including many im­
possible states. Similar argument is applicable to the
decision variable B. Because it is not necessary to com­
pute optimal choices of a decision variables for impos­
sible states, it is desirable to avoid the computation.

OUR SOLUTION

In this section, we present an approach for overcom­
ing the aforementioned disadvantage of influence di­
agrams. Our approach consists of two independent
components: a simple extension to influence diagrams
and a top-down method for influence diagram evalua­
tion.
Our extension allows explicitly expressing the fact that
some decision variables have different frames in dif­
ferent information states. We achieve this by intro­
ducing a framing function for each decision variable,
which characterizes the available alternatives for the
decision variable in different information states. With
the help of framing functions, our solution algorithm
effectively ignores the unavailable alternatives when
computing an optimal choice for a decision variable
in any information state. Our extension is inspired
by the concepts of indicator valuations and effective
frames proposed by Shenoy (1993).
Conceptually, our evaluation method, similar to
Howard and Matheson's method (Howard and Math-

Solving Asymmetric Decision Problems with Influence Diagrams

eson 1984), consists of two steps: in order to evaluate
an influence diagram, a decision tree is generated and
the evaluation is then carried out on the decision tree.
The first step will be described in this section. The
second step can be carried out either by the simple
"average-out-and-fold-back" method (Raiffa 1968),
or by a top-down search algorithm (Qi 1994). An ad­
vantage of using a search algorithm is that the two
steps of tree generation and optimal policy computa­
tion can be combined into one, and only a portion of
the tree needs to be generated, due to heuristic search.
Our method successfully avoids the unnecessary com­
putations by pruning those impossible states and ig­
noring those unavailable alternatives for the decision
variables.
In comparison with than Howard and Matheson's
method, ours has two distinct advantages. F irst, for
the same influence diagram, our method generates a
much smaller decision tree. Second, our method pro­
vides a clean interface to utilizing effi cient Bayesian net
algorithms (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter 1988, Pearl
1988).

generated by our method for an

node corresponds to an uncertain state resulting from
choosing an alternative for a decision variable in an
information state. Two states are consistent if the
variables common to both states have the same out­

For each information state S of the first decision
variable d1 , there is a choice node, as a child of
the root in the decision tree. The arc from the
root to the node is labeled with the probability
P {1r(d1 ) = S} . A choice node in the decision tree
is pruned if the probability on the arc to it is zero.

Let N be a choice node not pruned in the decision
tree, and SN be the inforn1ation state associated
with N. Assume that SN is for decision variable
d. Then, N has lfd(SN )I children, each corre­
sponding to an alternative in !d (SN) . These chil­
dren are all leaf nodes if d is the last decision vari­
able. Otherwise, they are chance nodes. The node
corresponding to alternative a E fd(SN) repre­
sents the state 1r(d) = SN, d =a.

cision maker can choose for d in information state s .
Following Shenoy (1993), we call fd(s) the effective
frame of decision variable d in informa tion state s.

be a chance node representing a state
1r(d;-1) = SN,di-1 = a, and let A be the
subset of the information states of decision vari­
able di which are consistent with 7r(d;_1) =
SN,di-1 = a. Node N has IAI children, each
being a choice node representing an information
state in A . Let S be the information state rep­
resented by a child of N . The arc from N to the
child is labeled with the conditional probability
P{1r(d;) = S!1r(d;_t) = SN,di-l = a } .

In the above specification, we effectively prune all of
the impossible information states for all decision vari­
ables and ignore the unavailable alternatives to deci­
sion variables.
We have not specified how to compute the probabili­
ties on the arcs from chance nodes nor how to compute
the values associated with the leaf nodes. As illus­
trated in (Qi and Poole 1993), various well established
Bayesian Net algorithms can be employed for comput­
ing the probabilities , and computing the values as­
sociated with the leaf nodes, which normally involve
only small portions of the influence diagram. In par­
ticular , in order to further exploit asymmetry, Smith's
method (Smith et al. 1993) can also be used for com­
puting those probabilities.

HOW WELL OUR ALGORITHM
DOES FOR THE USED CAR
BUYER PROBLEM

When applying our algorithm to the used car buyer
problem, a decision tree shown in Fig. 2 is generated.
In the graph, the leftmost box represents the only sit­
uation in which the first test decision is to be made.
The boxes in the middle column correspond to the in­
formation states i n which the second test decision is
to be made. Similarly, the boxes in the right column
correspond to the information states in which the pur­
chase decision is to be made. From the figure we see
that among those nodes corresponding to the infor­
mation states of the second test, all but two have only
one child because the effective frames of the second
test in the corresponding information states have only
a single element. Making use of the f ramin g function
this way is equivalent to six prunings , each cutting
a subtree under a node corresponding to an informa­
tion state of the second test. Those shadowed boxes
correspond to the impossible states. Our algorithm
effectively detect s those impossible states and prune
them when they are created. Each of such pruning
amounts to cutting a subtree under the cor responding
node. Consequently, our algorithm does not compute
optimal choices for a decision node for those impossi ble
states. For the used car buyer pro blem , our algorithm
computes optimal choices for the purchase deci sion for
only 12 information states, and opti mal choices for the
second test for only 8 information states (among which
six can be computed trivially ) . These constitute the
minimal information state set one has to consider in
order to compute an optimal policy for the used car
buyer problem. This suggests that, as far as decision
making concerned, our method exploits asymmetry to
the maximum extent. In contras t , whereas those al­
gorithms that do not exploit asymmetry will compute
the optimal choices for the pu rch ase decision for 96
(4 x 4 x 2 x 3) information sta tes and wi ll compute
optimal choices for the second test for 16 information
states.

RELATED WORK ON
HANDLING ASYMMETRIC
DECISION PROBLEMS

Recognizing that influence diagrams are not effec­
tive asymmetric decision problems, several researchers
have recently proposed alternative r epresent ations.
Fung and Shachter (1990) propose contingent influence
diagrams for explicitly expressing asymmetry of deci­
sion problems. In that representation, each variable is
associated with a set of contingencies, and associated
with one relation for each contingence. These relations
collectively specify the condi t ional distribution of the
variable.
Covaliu and Oliver (1992) p rop ose a different

represen-

tation for representing decision problems. This repre­
sentati on uses a decision diagram and a formulation
table to specify a decision problem . A decision dia­

gram is a directed acyclic graph whose directed paths
identify all possible sequences of decisions and events
in a decision problem. In a sense, a decision diagram
is a degenerate decision tree in which paths having a
common sequence of events are collap sed into one path
( Covaliu and Oliver 1992). Numer ical data are stored
in the formulation table.
Shenoy (1993) proposes a "factorization" approach for
representing degenerate probability distributions. In
that appro ach , a degenerate probability distribution
over a set of variables is decomposed into several fac­
tors over subsets of the variables such that the their
"product" is equivalent to the original distribution.
Smith et ai. (1993) present some interesting progress
towards exploiting asymmetry of decision problems.
They observe that an asymmetric decision problem of­
ten has some degenerate probability distributions, and
that the influence diagram evaluation can be sped up
if these degenerate probability distributions are used
properly. Their philosophy is analogous to the one
behind various algorithms for sparse matrix computa­
tion. In t hei r propos al , a conv entional influence dia­
gram is used to represent a decision problem at the
level of relation. In addition, they propose to use a
decision tree-like representation to describe the con­
ditional probability distributions associated with the
random variables in the influence diagram. The deci-

sion tree-like representation is effective for economi­
cally representing degenerate conditional probability
distributions. T hey propose a modified version of
Shachter's alg ori thm (Sha chter 1986) for influence di­
agram evaluation, and show how the decision tree­
like representation can be used to increase the effi­
ciency of arc reversal, a fundamental operation used in
Shachter's algorithm. However, their alg o r it hm cannot
avoid computing optimal choices for decision variables
with respect to impossible information states.
