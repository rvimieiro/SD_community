Abstract
The Fault-Tolerant Facility Placement problem (FTFP) is a generalization of the classic
Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFL). In FTFP we are given a set of facility sites
and a set of clients. Opening a facility at site i costs fi and connecting client j to a facility
at site i costs dij . We assume that the connection costs (distances) dij satisfy the triangle
inequality. Multiple facilities can be opened at any site. Each client j has a demand rj ,
which means that it needs to be connected to rj different facilities (some of which could
be located on the same site). The goal is to minimize the sum of facility opening cost and
connection cost.
The main result of this paper is a 1.575-approximation algorithm for FTFP, based on
LP-rounding. The algorithm first reduces the demands to values polynomial in the number
of sites. Then it uses a technique that we call adaptive partitioning, which partitions the
instance by splitting clients into unit demands and creating a number of (not yet opened)
facilities at each site. It also partitions the optimal fractional solution to produce a fractional solution for this new instance. The partitioned fractional solution satisfies a number
of properties that allow us to exploit existing LP-rounding methods for UFL to round our
partitioned solution to an integral solution, preserving the approximation ratio. In particular, our 1.575-approximation algorithm is based on the ideas from the 1.575-approximation
algorithm for UFL by Byrka et al., with changes necessary to satisfy the fault-tolerance
requirement.

1. Introduction
In the Fault-Tolerant Facility Placement problem (FTFP), we are given a set F of sites
at which facilities can be built, and a set C of clients with some demands that need to be
satisfied by different facilities. A client j ∈ C has demand rj . Building one facility at a site
i ∈ F incurs a cost fi , and connecting one unit of demand from client j to a facility at site i
costs dij . Throughout the paper we assume that the connection costs (distances) dij form a
metric, that is, they are symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality. In a feasible solution,
some number of facilities, possibly zero, are opened at each site i, and demands from each
client are connected to those open facilities, with the constraint that demands from the same
client have to be connected to different facilities. Note that any two facilities at the same
site are considered different.
It is easy to see that if all rj = 1 then FTFP reduces to the classic Uncapacitated Facility
Location problem (UFL). If we add a constraint that each site can have at most one facility
built on it, then the problem becomes equivalent to the Fault-Tolerant Facility Location
problem (FTFL). One implication of the one-facility-per-site restriction in FTFL is that
maxj∈C rj ≤ |F|, while in FTFP the values of rj ’s can be much bigger than |F|.
The UFL problem has a long history; in particular, great progress has been achieved in
the past two decades in developing techniques for designing constant-ratio approximation
algorithms for UFL. Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal [16] proposed an approach based on LProunding, that they used to achieve a ratio of 3.16. This was then improved by Chudak [5] to
1.736, and later by Sviridenko [17] to 1.582. The best known “pure” LP-rounding algorithm
is due to Byrka et al. [3] with ratio 1.575. Byrka and Aardal [2] gave a hybrid algorithm that
combines LP-rounding and dual-fitting (based on [10]), achieving a ratio of 1.5. Recently,
Li [13] showed that, with a more refined analysis and randomizing the scaling parameter
used in [2], the ratio can be improved to 1.488. This is the best known approximation
result for UFL. Other techniques include the primal-dual algorithm with ratio 3 by Jain and
Vazirani [11], the dual fitting method by Jain et al. [10] that gives ratio 1.61, and a local
search heuristic by Arya et al. [1] with approximation ratio 3. On the hardness side, UFL is
easily shown to be NP-hard, and it is known that it is not possible to approximate UFL in
polynomial time with ratio less than 1.463, provided that NP 6⊆ DTIME(nO(log log n) ) [6]. An
observation by Sviridenko strengthened the underlying assumption to P 6= NP (see [19]).
FTFL was first introduced by Jain and Vazirani [12] and they adapted their primal-dual
algorithm for UFL to obtain a ratio of 3 ln(maxj∈C rj ). All subsequently discovered constantratio approximation algorithms use variations of LP-rounding. The first such algorithm, by
Guha et al. [7], adapted the approach for UFL from [16]. Swamy and Shmoys [18] improved
the ratio to 2.076 using the idea of pipage rounding introduced in [17]. Most recently, Byrka et
al. [4] improved the ratio to 1.7245 using dependent rounding and laminar clustering.
FTFP is a natural generalization of UFL. It was first studied by Xu and Shen [20], who
extended the dual-fitting algorithm from [10] to give an approximation algorithm with a ratio
claimed to be 1.861. However their algorithm runs in polynomial time only if maxj∈C rj is

2

polynomial in O(|F|·|C|) and the analysis of the performance guarantee in [20] is flawed2 . To
date, the best approximation ratio for FTFP in the literature is 3.16, established by Yan and
Chrobak [21], while the only known lower bound is the 1.463 lower bound for UFL from [6],
as UFL is a special case of FTFP. If all demand values rj are equal, the problem can be
solved by simple scaling and applying LP-rounding algorithms for UFL. This does not affect
the approximation ratio, thus achieving ratio 1.575 for this special case (see also [14]).
The main result of this paper is an LP-rounding algorithm for FTFP with approximation
ratio 1.575, matching the best ratio for UFL achieved via the LP-rounding method [3] and
significantly improving our earlier bound in [21]. In Section 3 we prove that, for the purpose of
LP-based approximations, the general FTFP problem can be reduced to the restricted version
where all demand values are polynomial in the number of sites. This demand reduction trick
itself gives us a ratio of 1.7245, since we can then treat an instance of FTFP as an instance
of FTFL by creating a sufficient (but polynomial) number of facilities at each site, and then
using the algorithm from [4] to solve the FTFL instance.
The reduction to polynomial demands suggests an approach where clients’ demands are
split into unit demands. These unit demands can be thought of as “unit-demand clients”,
and a natural approach would be to adapt LP-rounding methods from [8, 5, 3] to this
new set of unit-demand clients. Roughly, these algorithms iteratively pick a client that
minimizes a certain cost function (that varies for different algorithms) and open one facility
in the neighborhood of this client. The remaining clients are then connected to these open
facilities. In order for this to work, we also need to convert the optimal fractional solution
(x∗ , y ∗ ) of the original instance into a solution (x̄, ȳ) of the modified instance which then can
be used in the LP-rounding process. This can be thought of as partitioning the fractional
solution, as each connection value x∗ij must be divided between the rj unit demands of client
j in some way. In Section 4 we formulate a set of properties required for this partitioning
to work. For example, one property guarantees that we can connect demands to facilities
so that two demands from the same client are connected to different facilities. Then we
present our adaptive partitioning technique that computes a partitioning with all the desired
properties. Using adaptive partitioning we were able to extend the algorithms for UFL from
[8, 5, 3] to FTFP. We illustrate the fundamental ideas of our approach in Section 5, showing
how they can be used to design an LP-rounding algorithm with ratio 3. In Section 6 we
refine the algorithm to improve the approximation ratio to 1 + 2/e ≈ 1.736. Finally, in
Section 7, we improve it even further to 1.575 – the main result of this paper.
Summarizing, our contributions are two-fold: One, we show that the existing LP-rounding
algorithms for UFL can be extended to a much more general problem FTFP, retaining
the approximation ratio. We believe that, should even better LP-rounding algorithms be
developed for UFL in the future, using our demand reduction and adaptive partitioning
methods, it should be possible to extend them to FTFP. In fact, some improvement of the
ratio should be achieved by randomizing the scaling parameter γ used in our algorithm,
as Li showed in [13] for UFL. (Since the ratio 1.488 for UFL in [13] uses also dual-fitting

algorithms [15], we would not obtain the same ratio for FTFP yet using only LP-rounding.)
Two, our ratio of 1.575 is significantly better than the best currently known ratio of 1.7245
for the closely-related FTFL problem. This suggests that in the fault-tolerant scenario the
capability of creating additional copies of facilities on the existing sites makes the problem
easier from the point of view of approximation.
2. The LP Formulation
The FTFP problem has a natural Integer Programming (IP) formulation. Let yi represent
the number of facilities built at site i and let xij represent the number of connections from
client j to facilities at site i. If we relax the integrality constraints, we obtain the following
LP:

minimize cost(x, y) =

P

i∈F

subject to yi − xij ≥ 0
P
i∈F xij ≥ rj
xij ≥ 0, yi ≥ 0

fi y i +

P

i∈F,j∈C

∀i ∈ F, j ∈ C
∀j ∈ C
∀i ∈ F, j ∈ C

The dual program is:

(2)

βij ≤ fi

αj − βij ≤ dij
αj ≥ 0, βij ≥ 0

∀i ∈ F
∀i ∈ F, j ∈ C
∀i ∈ F, j ∈ C

In each of our algorithms we will fix some optimal solutions of the LPs (1) and (2) that
we will denote by (x∗ , y ∗ ) and (α∗ , β ∗ ), respectively.

optimal connection cost as C = i∈F,j∈C dij xij . Then LP = cost(x , y ) = F + C ∗ is the
joint optimal value of P
(1) and (2). We can also associate
with each client j its fractional
P

connection cost Cj = i∈F dij xij . Clearly, C = j∈C Cj . Throughout the paper we will
use notation OPT for the optimal integral solution of (1). OPT is the value we wish to
approximate, but, since OPT ≥ LP∗ , we can instead use LP∗ to estimate the approximation
ratio of our algorithms.
Completeness and facility splitting. Define (x∗ , y ∗ ) to be complete if x∗ij > 0 implies
that x∗ij = yi∗ for all i, j. In other words, each connection either uses a site fully or not at
all. As shown by Chudak and Shmoys [5], we can modify the given instance by adding at
4

most |C| sites to obtain an equivalent instance that has a complete optimal solution, where
“equivalent” means that the values of F ∗ , C ∗ and LP∗ , as well as OPT, are not affected.
Roughly, the argument is this: We notice that, without loss of generality, for each client k
there exists at most one site i such that 0 < x∗ik < yi∗ . We can then perform the following
facility splitting operation on i: introduce a new site i0 , let yi∗0 = yi∗ − x∗ik , redefine yi∗ to be
x∗ik , and then for each client j redistribute x∗ij so that i retains as much connection value as
possible and i0 receives the rest. Specifically, we set
yi∗0 ← yi∗ − x∗ik , yi∗ ← x∗ik , and
x∗i0 j ← max(x∗ij − x∗ik , 0), x∗ij ← min(x∗ij , x∗ik ) for all j 6= k.
This operation eliminates the partial connection between k and i and does not create any
new partial connections. Each client can split at most one site and hence we shall have at
most |C| more sites.
By the above paragraph, without loss of generality we can assume that the optimal
fractional solution (x∗ , y ∗ ) is complete. This assumption will in fact greatly simplify some
of the arguments in the paper. Additionally, we will frequently use the facility splitting
operation described above in our algorithms to obtain fractional solutions with desirable
properties.
3. Reduction to Polynomial Demands
This section presents a demand reduction trick that reduces the problem for arbitrary
demands to a special case where demands are bounded by |F|, the number of sites. (The
formal statement is a little more technical – see Theorem 2.) Our algorithms in the sections
that follow process individual demands of each client one by one, and thus they critically
rely on the demands being bounded polynomially in terms of |F| and |C| to keep the overall
running time polynomial.
The reduction is based on an optimal fractionalPsolution (x∗ , y ∗ ) of LP (1). From the
optimality of this solution, we can also assume that i∈F x∗ij = rj for all j ∈ C. As explained
in Section 2, we can assume that (x∗ , y ∗ ) is complete, that is x∗ij > 0 implies x∗ij = yi∗ for all
i, j. We split this solution into two parts, namely (x∗ , y ∗ ) = (x̂, ŷ) + (ẋ, ẏ), where
ŷi ← byi∗ c,

x̂ij ← bx∗ij c and

ẏi ← yi∗ − byi∗ c,

ẋij ← x∗ij − bx∗ij c

for all i, j. Now we construct two FTFP instances Î and İ with the
P same parameters as the
original instance, except that the demand of each client j is r̂j = i∈F x̂ij in instance Î and
P
ṙj = i∈F ẋij = rj − r̂j in instance İ. It is obvious that if we have integral solutions to both
Î and İ then, when added together, they form an integral solution to the original instance.
Moreover, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 1. (i) (x̂, ŷ) is a feasible integral solution to instance Î.
(ii) (ẋ, ẏ) is a feasible fractional solution to instance İ.
(iii) ṙj ≤ |F| for every client j.
5

Proof. (i) For feasibility, we need to verifyPthat the constraints of LP (1) are satisfied.
Directly from the definition, we have r̂j = i∈F x̂ij . For any i and j, by the feasibility of
(x∗ , y ∗ ) we have x̂ij = bx∗ij c ≤ byi∗ c = ŷi . P
(ii) From the definition, we have ṙj = i∈F ẋij . It remains to show that ẏi ≥ ẋij for all
i, j. If x∗ij = 0, then ẋij = 0 and we are done. Otherwise, by completeness, we have x∗ij = yi∗ .
Then ẏi = yi∗ − byi∗ c = x∗ij − bx∗ij c = ẋij .
(iii) From the definition of ẋij we have ẋij < 1. Then the bound follows from the definition
of ṙj .
Notice that our construction relies on the completeness assumption; in fact, it is easy
to give an example where (ẋ, ẏ) would not be feasible if we used a non-complete optimal
solution (x∗ , y ∗ ). Note also that the solutions (x̂, ŷ) and (ẋ, ẏ) are in fact optimal for their
corresponding instances, for if a better solution to Î or İ existed, it could give us a solution
to I with a smaller objective value.
Theorem 2. Suppose that there is a polynomial-time algorithm A that, for any instance
of FTFP with maximum demand bounded by |F|, computes an integral solution that approximates the fractional optimum of this instance within factor ρ ≥ 1. Then there is a
ρ-approximation algorithm A0 for FTFP.
Proof. Given an FTFP instance with arbitrary demands, Algorithm A0 works as follows: it
solves the LP (1) to obtain a fractional optimal solution (x∗ , y ∗ ), then it constructs instances
Î and İ described above, applies algorithm A to İ, and finally combines (by adding the
values) the integral solution (x̂, ŷ) of Î and the integral solution of İ produced by A. This
clearly produces a feasible integral solution for the original instance I. The solution produced
by A has cost at most ρ · cost(ẋ, ẏ), because (ẋ, ẏ) is feasible for İ. Thus the cost of A0 is
at most
cost(x̂, ŷ) + ρ · cost(ẋ, ẏ) ≤ ρ(cost(x̂, ŷ) + cost(ẋ, ẏ)) = ρ · LP∗ ≤ ρ · OPT,
where the first inequality follows from ρ ≥ 1. This completes the proof.
4. Adaptive Partitioning
In this section we develop our second technique, which we call adaptive partitioning.
Given an FTFP instance and an optimal fractional solution (x∗ , y ∗ ) to LP (1), we split each
client j into rj individual unit demand points (or just demands), and we split each site i into
no more than |F| + 2R|C|2 facility points (or facilities), where R = maxj∈C rj . We denote
the demand set by C and the facility set by F, respectively. We will also partition (x∗ , y ∗ )
into a fractional solution (x̄, ȳ) for the split instance. We will typically use symbols ν and
µ to index demands and facilities respectively,
 that is x̄ = (x̄µν ) and ȳ = (ȳµ ). As before,
the neighborhood of a demand ν is N (ν) = µ ∈ F : x̄µν > 0 . We will use notation ν ∈ j
to mean that ν is a demand of client j; similarly, µ ∈ i means that facility µ is on site i.
Different demands of the same client (that is, ν, ν 0 ∈ j) are called siblings. Further, we use
6

the convention that fµ = fi for
µ ∈ i, αν∗ = αj∗Pfor ν ∈ j and dµν = dµj = dij for µ ∈ i
P
and ν ∈ j. We define Cνavg = µ∈N (ν) dµν x̄µν = µ∈F dµν x̄µν . One can think of Cνavg as the
average connection cost of demand ν, if we chose a connection to facility P
µ with probability
x̄µν . In our partitioned fractional solution we guarantee for every ν that µ∈F x̄µν = 1.
Some demands in C will be designated as primary demands and the set of primary
demands will be denoted by P . By definition we have P ⊆ C. In addition, we will use
the overlap structure between demand neighborhoods to define a mapping that assigns each
demand ν ∈ C to some primary demand κ ∈ P . As shown in the rounding algorithms
in later sections, for each primary demand we guarantee exactly one open facility in its
neighborhood, while for a non-primary demand, there is constant probability that none of
its neighbors open. In this case we estimate its connection cost by the distance to the facility
opened in its assigned primary demand’s neighborhood. For this reason the connection cost
of a primary demand must be “small” compared to the non-primary demands assigned to
it. We also need sibling demands assigned to different primary demands to satisfy the faulttolerance requirement. Specifically, this partitioning will be constructed to satisfy a number
of properties that are detailed below.
(PS) Partitioned solution. Vector (x̄, ȳ) is a partition of (x∗ , y ∗ ), with unit-value demands,

(CO) Completeness. Solution (x̄, ȳ) is complete, that is x̄µν 6= 0 implies x̄µν = ȳµ , for all
µ ∈ F, ν ∈ C.
(PD) Primary demands. Primary demands satisfy the following conditions:
1. For any two different primary demands κ, κ0 ∈ P we have N (κ) ∩ N (κ0 ) = ∅.

2. For each site i ∈ F, µ∈i κ∈P x̄µκ ≤ yi∗ .
3. Each demand ν ∈ C is assigned to one primary demand κ ∈ P such that
(a) N (ν) ∩ N (κ) 6= ∅, and
(b) Cνavg + αν∗ ≥ Cκavg + ακ∗ .
(SI) Siblings. For any pair ν, ν 0 of different siblings we have
1. N (ν) ∩ N (ν 0 ) = ∅.
2. If ν is assigned to a primary demand κ then N (ν 0 ) ∩ N (κ) = ∅. In particular,
by Property (PD.3(a)), this implies that different sibling demands are assigned
to different primary demands.

As we shall demonstrate in later sections, these properties allow us to extend known UFL
rounding algorithms to obtain an integral solution to our FTFP problem with a matching
approximation ratio. Our partitioning is “adaptive” in the sense that it is constructed one
demand at a time, and the connection values for the demands of a client depend on the choice
of earlier demands, of this or other clients, and their connection values. We would like to point
out that the adaptive partitioning process for the 1.575-approximation algorithm (Section 7)
is more subtle than that for the 3-apprximation (Section 5) and the 1.736-approximation
algorithms (Section 6), due to the introduction of close and far neighborhood.
Implementation of Adaptive Partitioning. We now describe an algorithm for partitioning the instance and the fractional solution so that the properties (PS), (CO), (PD), and
(SI) are satisfied. Recall that F and C, respectively, denote the sets of facilities and demands
that will be created in this stage, and (x̄, ȳ) is the partitioned solution to be computed.
The adaptive partitioning algorithm consists of two phases: Phase 1 is called the partitioning phase and Phase 2 is called the augmenting phase. Phase 1 is done in iterations,
where in each iteration we find the “best” client j and create a new demand ν out of it. This
demand either becomes a primary demand itself, or it is assigned to some existing primary
demand. We call a client j exhausted when all its rj demands have been created and assigned
to some primary demands. Phase 1 completes when all clients are exhausted. In Phase 2
we ensure that every demand has a total connection values x̄µν equal to 1, that is condition
(PS.1).
For each site i we will initially create one “big” facility µ with initial value ȳµ = yi∗ . While
we partition the instance, creating new demands and connections, this facility may end up
being split into more facilities to preserve completeness of the fractional solution. Also,
we will gradually decrease the fractional connection vector for each client j, to account for
the demands already created for j and their connection values. These decreased connection
e . The intuition is that x
e represents the part of
values will be stored in an auxiliary vector x
∗
e for
x that still has not been allocated to existing demands and future demands can use x
e will be indexed by facilities (rather than sites)
their connections. For technical reasons, x
e = (e
and clients, that is x
xµj ). At the beginning, we set x
eµj ← x∗ij for each j ∈ C, where
µ ∈ i is the single facility created initially at site i. At each step, whenever we create a new
demand ν for a client j, we will define its values x̄µν and appropriately reduce the values
e and
x
eµj , for all facilities µ. We will deal with two types of neighborhoods, with respect to x
e
eµj > 0} for j ∈ C and N (ν) = {µ ∈ F : x̄µν > 0} for ν ∈ C.
x̄, that is N (j) = {µ ∈ F : x
e and x̄.
During this process we preserve the completeness (CO) of the fractional solutions x
More precisely, the following properties will hold for every facility µ after every iteration:
(c1) For each demand ν either x̄µν = 0 or x̄µν = ȳµ . This is the same condition as condition
(CO), yet we repeat it here as (c1) needs to hold after every iteration, while condition
(CO) only applies to the final partitioned fractional solution (x̄, ȳ).
(c2) For each client j, either x
eµj = 0 or x
eµj = ȳµ .
A full description of the algorithm is given in Pseudocode 1. Initially, the set U of nonexhausted clients contains all clients, the set C of demands is empty, the set F of facilities
8

consists of one facility µ on each site i with ȳµ = yi∗ , and the set P of primary demands
is empty (Lines 1–4). In one iteration of the while loop (Lines 5–8), for each client j we
compute a quantity called tcc(j) (tentative connection cost), that represents the average
e1 (j) of the nearest facilities µ whose total connection value to j
distance from j to the set N
(the sum of x
eµj ’s) equals 1. This set is computed by Procedure NearestUnitChunk() (see
e1 (j) in order of nondecreasing distance,
Pseudocode 2, Lines 1–9), which adds facilities to N
until the total connection value is exactly 1. (The procedure actually uses the ȳµ values,
which are equal to the connection values, by the completeness condition (c2).) This may
require splitting the last added facility and adjusting the connection values so that conditions
(c1) and (c2) are preserved.

e1 (p) is disjoint from the neighborhoods of all
bigger set, into N (ν). The other case is when N
existing primary demands. Then, in Lines 15–16, ν becomes itself a primary demand and
e1 (p) from p
we assign ν to itself. It also inherits the connection values to all facilities µ ∈ N
(recall that x
eµp = ȳµ ), with all other x̄µν values set to 0.
At this point all primary demands satisfy Property (PS.1), but this may not be true
for non-primary demands. For those demands we still may need to adjust the x̄µν values
def P
so that the total connection value for ν, that is conn(ν) =
µ∈F x̄µν , is equal 1. This is
accomplished by Procedure AugmentToUnit() (definition in Pseudocode 2, Lines 10–21)
that allocates to ν ∈ j some of the remaining connection values x
eµj of client j (Lines 19–21).
AugmentToUnit() will repeatedly pick any facility η with x
eηj > 0. If x
eηj ≤ 1 − conn(ν),
then the connection value x
eηj is reassigned to ν. Otherwise, x
eηj > 1 − conn(ν), in which case
we split η so that connecting ν to one of the created copies of η will make conn(ν) equal 1,
and we’ll be done.
Notice that we start with |F| facilities and in each iteration of the while loop in Line 5
(Pseudocode 1) each client causes at most one split. We have a total of no more than R|C|
iterations as in each iteration we create one demand. (Recall that R = maxj rj .) In Phase 2
we do an augment step for each demand ν and this creates no more than R|C| new facilities.

10

So the total number of facilities we created will be at most |F| + R|C|2 + R|C| ≤ |F| + 2R|C|2 ,
which is polynomial in |F| + |C| due to our earlier bound on R.
Example. We now illustrate our partitioning algorithm with an example, where the FTFP
instance has four sites and four clients. The demands are r1 = 1 and r2 = r3 = r4 = 2. The
facility costs are fi = 1 for all i. The distances are defined as follows: dii = 3 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4
and dij = 1 for all i 6= j. Solving the LP(1), we obtain the fractional solution given in
Table 1a.

Table 1: An example of an execution of the partitioning algorithm. (a) An optimal fractional
solution x∗ , y ∗ . (b) The partitioned solution. j 0 and j 00 denote the first and second demand
of a client j, and ı̇ and ı̈ denote the first and second facility at site i.
It is easily seen that the fractional solution in Table 1a is optimal and complete (x∗ij > 0
implies x∗ij = yi∗ ). The dual optimal solution has all αj∗ = 4/3 for j = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Now we perform Phase 1, the adaptive partitioning, following the description in Pseudocode 1. To streamline the presentation, we assume that all ties are broken in favor of
lower-numbered clients, demands or facilities. First we create one facility at each of the four
sites, denoted as 1̇, 2̇, 3̇ and 4̇ (Line 2–4, Pseudocode 1). We then execute the “while” loop
in Line 5 Pseudocode 1. This loop will have seven iterations. Consider the first iteration.
e1 (2),
In Line 7–8 we compute tcc(j) for each client j = 1, 2, 3, 4 in U . When computing N
facility 1̇ will get split into 1̇ and 1̈ with ȳ1̇ = 1 and ȳ1̈ = 1/3. (This will happen in Line 4–7
of Pseudocode 2.) Then, in Line 9 we will pick client p = 1 and create a demand denoted as
10 (see Table 1b). Since there are no primary demands yet, we make 10 a primary demand
e1 (1) = {2̇, 3̇, 4̇}. Notice that client 1 is exhausted after this iteration and U
with N (10 ) = N
becomes {2, 3, 4}.
In the second iteration we compute tcc(j) for j = 2, 3, 4 and pick client p = 2, from which
e1 (2) = {1̇}, which is disjoint from N (10 ). So we create
we create a new demand 20 . We have N
a demand 20 and make it primary, and set N (20 ) = {1̇}. In the third iteration we compute
e1 (2) = {1̈, 3̇, 4̇} overlaps with
tcc(j) for j = 2, 3, 4 and again we pick client p = 2. Since N
e (2) = {3̇, 4̇}.
N (10 ), we create a demand 200 and assign it to 10 . We also set N (200 ) = N (10 ) ∩ N
After this iteration client 2 is exhausted and we have U = {3, 4}.
In the fourth iteration we compute tcc(j) for client j = 3, 4. We pick p = 3 and create
e1 (3) = {1̇} overlaps N (20 ), we assign 30 to 20 and set N (30 ) = {1̇}. In
demand 30 . Since N
11

the fifth iteration we compute tcc(j) for client j = 3, 4 and pick p = 3 again. At this time
e1 (3) = {1̈, 2̇, 4̇}, which overlaps with N (10 ). So we create a demand 300 and assign it to 10 ,
N
as well as set N (300 ) = {2̇, 4̇}.
In the last two iterations we will pick client p = 4 twice and create demands 40 and 400 .
e1 (4) = {1̇} so we assign 40 to 20 and set N (40 ) = {1̇}. For 400 we have
For 40 we have N
e1 (4) = {1̈, 2̇, 3̇} and we assign it to 10 , as well as set N (400 ) = {2̇, 3̇}.
N
Now that all clients are exhausted we perform Phase 2, the augmenting phase, to construct a fractional solution in which all demands have total connection value equal to 1. We
iterate through each of the seven demands created, that is 10 , 20 , 200 , 30 , 300 , 40 , 400 . 10 and 20
already have neighborhoods with total connection value of 1, so nothing will change in the
first two iterations. 200 has 3̇, 4̇ in its neighborhood, with total connection value of 2/3, and
e (2) = {1̈} at this time, so we add 1̈ into N (200 ) to make N (200 ) = {1̈, 3̇, 4̇} and now 200 has
N
total connection value of 1. Similarly, 300 and 400 each get 1̈ added to their neighborhood and
end up with total connection value of 1. The other two demands, namely 30 and 40 , each
have 1̇ in its neighborhood so each of them has already its total connection value equal 1.
This completes Phase 2.
The final partitioned fractional solution is given in Table 1b. We have created a total of
five facilities 1̇, 1̈, 2̇, 3̇, 4̇, and seven demands, 10 , 20 , 200 , 30 , 300 , 40 , 400 . It can be verified that all
the stated properties are satisfied.
Correctness. We now show that all the required properties (PS), (CO), (PD) and (SI) are
satisfied by the above construction.
Properties (PS) and (CO) follow directly from the algorithm. (CO) is implied by the completeness condition (c1) that the algorithm maintains after each iteration. Condition (PS.1)
is a result of calling Procedure AugmentToUnit() in Line 21. To see that (PS.2) holds,
note thatP
at each
maintains the invariant that, for every i ∈ F and j ∈ C,
P step the algorithm
P
we have µ∈i ν∈j x̄µν + µ∈i x
eµj = x∗ij . In the end, we will P
createP
rj demands for each
client j, with each demand ν ∈ j satisfying (PS.1), and thus ν∈j µ∈F x̄µν = rj . This
implies that x
eµj = 0 for every facility µ ∈ F, and (PS.2) follows. (PS.3) holds because every
time we split a facility µ into µ0 and µ00 , the sum of ȳµ0 and ȳµ00 is equal to the old value of
ȳµ .
Now we deal with properties in group (PD). First, (PD.1) follows directly from the
algorithm, Pseudocode 1 (Lines 14–16), since every primary demand has its neighborhood
fixed when created, and that neighborhood is disjoint from those of the existing primary
demands.
Property (PD.2) follows from (PD.1), (CO) and (PS.3). In more detail, it can be justified
as follows. By (PD.1), for each µ ∈ i there is at most one κ ∈ P with x̄µκ > 0 and we have
x̄µκ = ȳµ due do (CO). Let K ⊆ i be the set of those µ’s for which such P
κ ∈ PPexists, and
denote
this κ P
by κµ . Then,
(CO) and (PS.3), we have µ∈i κ∈P x̄µκ =

Property (PD.3(a)) follows from the way the algorithm assigns primary demands. When
demand ν of client p is assigned to a primary demand κ in Lines 11–13 of Pseudocode 1, we
12

e (p) ∩ N (κ) (the intersection is nonempty) into N (ν), and we never
move all facilities in N
remove a facility from N (ν). We postpone the proof for (PD.3(b)) to Lemma 5.
Finally we argue that the properties in group (SI) hold. (SI.1) is easy, since for any client
j, each facility µ is added to the neighborhood of at most one demand ν ∈ j, by setting x̄µν to
ȳµ , while other siblings ν 0 of ν have x̄µν 0 = 0. Note that right after a demand ν ∈ p is created,
e (p) = ∅, by Lines 11–
its neighborhood is disjoint from the neighborhood of p, that is N (ν)∩ N
13 of the algorithm. Thus all demands of p created later will have neighborhoods disjoint from
the set N (ν) before the augmenting phase 2. Furthermore, Procedure AugmentToUnit()
preserves this property, because when it adds a facility to N (ν) then it removes it from
e (p).
e (p), and in case of splitting, one resulting facility is added to N (ν) and the other to N
N
Property (SI.2) is shown below in Lemma 3.
It remains to show Properties (PD.3(b)) and (SI.2). We show them in the lemmas below,
thus completing the description of our adaptive partition process.
Lemma 3. Property (SI.2) holds after the Adaptive Partitioning stage.
Proof. Let ν1 , . . . , νrj be the demands of a client j ∈ C, listed in the order of creation, and,
for each q = 1, 2, . . . , rj , denote by κq the primary demand that νq is assigned to. After the
completion of Phase 1 of Pseudocode 1 (Lines 5–18), we have N (νs ) ⊆ N (κs ) for s = 1, . . . , rj .
Since any two primary demands have disjoint neighborhoods, we have N (νs ) ∩ N (κq ) = ∅
for any s 6= q, that is Property (SI.2) holds right after Phase 1.
After Phase 1 all neighborhoods N (κs ), s = 1, . . . , rj have already been fixed and they do
e (j) appear in any of N (κs ) for s = 1, . . . , rj ,
not change in Phase 2. None of the facilities in N
by the way we allocate facilities in Lines 13 and 16. Therefore during the augmentation
e (j) to N (ν), for some ν ∈ j (Line 19–21
process in Phase 2, when we add facilities from N
of Pseudocode 1), all the required disjointness conditions will be preserved.
We need one more lemma before proving our last property (PD.3(b)). For a client j and
a demand ν, we use notation tccν (j) for the value of tcc(j) at the time when ν was created.
(It is not necessary that ν ∈ j but we assume that j is not exhausted at that time.)
Lemma 4. Let η and ν be two demands, with η created no later than ν, and let j ∈ C be a
client that is not exhausted when ν is created. Then we have
(a) tccη (j) ≤ tccν (j), and
(b) if ν ∈ j then tccη (j) ≤ Cνavg .
Proof. We focus first on the time when demand η is about to be created, right after the
e (j) = {µ1 , ..., µq } with all
call to NearestUnitChunk() in Pseudocode 1, Line 7. Let N
facilities µs ordered according to nondecreasing distance from j. Consider the following
linear program:
X
minimize
dµs j zs
Xs
subject to
zs ≥ 1
s

13

0 ≤ zs ≤ x
eµs j

for all s

This is a fractional minimum knapsack covering problem (with knapsack size equal 1) and
its optimal fractional solution is the greedy solution, whose value is exactly tccη (j).
On the other hand, we claim that tccν (j) can be thought of as the value of some feasible
solution to this linear program, and that the same is true for Cνavg if ν ∈ j. Indeed, each of
these quantities involves some later values x
eµj , where µ could be one of the facilities µs or
a new facility obtained from splitting. For each s, however, the sum of all values x
eµj , over
the facilities µ that were split from µs , cannot exceed the value x
eµs j at the time when η was
created, because splitting facilities preserves this sum and creating new demands for j can
only decrease it. Therefore both quantities tccν (j) and Cνavg (for ν ∈ j) correspond to some
choice of the zs variables (adding up to 1), and the lemma follows.
Lemma 5. Property (PD.3(b)) holds after the Adaptive Partitioning stage.
Proof. Suppose that demand ν ∈ j is assigned to some primary demand κ ∈ p. Then
Cκavg + ακ∗ = tccκ (p) + αp∗ ≤ tccκ (j) + αj∗ ≤ Cνavg + αν∗ .
We now justify this derivation. By definition we have ακ∗ = αp∗ . Further, by the algorithm, if
κ is a primary demand of client p, then Cκavg is equal to tcc(p) computed when κ is created,
which is exactly tccκ (p). Thus the first equation is true. The first inequality follows from
the choice of p in Line 9 in Pseudocode 1. The last inequality holds because αj∗ = αν∗ (due
to ν ∈ j), and because tccκ (j) ≤ Cνavg , which follows from Lemma 4.
We have thus proved that all properties (PS), (CO), (PD) and (SI) hold for our partitioned
fractional solution (x̄, ȳ). In the following sections we show how to use these properties to
round the fractional solution to an approximate integral solution. For the 3-approximation
algorithm (Section 5) and the 1.736-approximation algorithm (Section 6), the first phase of
the algorithm is exactly the same partition process as described above. However, the 1.575approximation algorithm (Section 7) demands a more sophisticated partitioning process as
the interplay between close and far neighborhood of sibling demands result in more delicate
properties that our partitioned fractional solution must satisfy.
5. Algorithm EGUP with Ratio 3
With the partitioned FTFP instance and its associated fractional solution in place, we
now begin to introduce our rounding algorithms. The algorithm we describe in this section
achieves ratio 3. Although this is still quite far from our best ratio 1.575 that we derive
later, we include this algorithm in the paper to illustrate, in a relatively simple setting, how
the properties of our partitioned fractional solution are used in rounding it to an integral
solution with cost not too far away from an optimal solution. The rounding approach we
use here is an extension of the corresponding method for UFL described in [8].

14

Algorithm EGUP. At a high level, we would open exactly one facility for each primary
demand κ, and each non-primary demand is connected to the facility opened for the primary
demand it was assigned to.
More precisely, we apply a rounding process, guided by the fractional values (ȳµ ) and
(x̄µν ), that produces an integral solution. This integral solution is obtained by choosing a
subset of facilities in F to open, and for each demand in C, specifying an open facility that
this demand will be connected to. For each primary demand κ ∈ P , we want to open one
facility φ(κ) ∈ N (κ). To this end, we use randomization: for each µ ∈ N (κ), we choose
φ(κ) = µ with probability x̄µκ , ensuring that exactly one µ ∈ N (κ) is chosen. Note that
P
µ∈N (κ) x̄µκ = 1, so this distribution is well-defined. We open this facility φ(κ) and connect
to φ(κ) all demands that are assigned to κ.
In our description above, the algorithm is presented as a randomized algorithm. It can
be de-randomized using the method of conditional expectations, which is commonly used in
approximation algorithms for facility location problems and standard enough that presenting
it here would be redundant. Readers less familiar with this field are recommended to consult
[5], where the method of conditional expectations is applied in a context very similar to ours.
Analysis. We now bound the expected facility cost and connection cost by establishing the
two lemmas below.
Lemma 6. The expectation of facility cost FEGUP of our solution is at most F ∗ .
Proof. By Property (PD.1), the neighborhoods of primary demands are disjoint. Also, for
any primary demand κ ∈ P , the probability that a facility µ ∈ N (κ) is chosen as the open
facility φ(κ) is x̄µκ . Hence the expected total facility cost is

P P
P

P
≤ i∈F fi yi∗ = F ∗ ,
where the inequality follows from Property (PD.2).
Lemma 7. The expectation of connection cost CEGUP of our solution is at most C ∗ + 2 · LP∗ .
Proof. For a primary demand κ, its expected connection cost is Cκavg because we choose
facility µ with probability x̄µκ .
Consider a non-primary demand ν assigned to a primary demand κ ∈ P . Let µ be any
facility in N (ν) ∩ N (κ). Since µ is in both N (ν) and N (κ), we have dµν ≤ αν∗ and dµκ ≤ ακ∗
∗
(This follows from the complementary slackness conditions since αν∗ = βµν
+ dµν for each
µ ∈ N (ν).). Thus, applying the triangle inequality, for any fixed choice of facility φ(κ) we
have
dφ(κ)ν ≤ dφ(κ)κ + dµκ + dµν ≤ dφ(κ)κ + ακ∗ + αν∗ .

15

Therefore the expected distance from ν to its facility φ(κ) is
E[dφ(κ)ν ] ≤ Cκavg + ακ∗ + αν∗
≤ Cνavg + αν∗ + αν∗ = Cνavg + 2αν∗ ,
where the second inequality follows from Property (PD.3(b)). From the definition of Cνavg
and Property (PS.2), for any j ∈ C we have

E[CEGUP ] ≤ j∈C ν∈j (Cνavg + 2αν∗ )
P
= j∈C (Cj∗ + 2rj αj∗ ) = C ∗ + 2 · LP∗ ,
completing the proof of the lemma.
Theorem 8. Algorithm EGUP is a 3-approximation algorithm.
Proof. By Property (SI.2), different demands from the same client are assigned to different
primary demands, and by (PD.1) each primary demand opens a different facility. This
ensures that our solution is feasible, namely each client j is connected to rj different facilities
(some possibly located on the same site). As for the total cost, Lemma 6 and Lemma 7 imply
that the total cost is at most F ∗ + C ∗ + 2 · LP∗ = 3 · LP∗ ≤ 3 · OPT.
6. Algorithm ECHS with Ratio 1.736
In this section we improve the approximation ratio to 1 + 2/e ≈ 1.736. The improvement
comes from a slightly modified rounding process and refined analysis. Note that the facility
opening cost of Algorithm EGUP does not exceed that of the fractional optimum solution,
while the connection cost could be far from the optimum, since we connect a non-primary
demand to a facility in the neighborhood of its assigned primary demand and then estimate
the distance using the triangle inequality. The basic idea to improve the estimate of the
connection cost, following the approach of Chudak and Shmoys [5], is to connect each nonprimary demand to its nearest neighbor when one is available, and to only use the facility
opened by its assigned primary demand when none of its neighbors is open.
Algorithm ECHS. As before, the algorithm starts by solving the linear program and
applying the adaptive partitioning algorithm described in Section 4 to obtain a partitioned
solution (x̄, ȳ). Then we apply the rounding process to compute an integral solution (see
Pseudocode 3).
16

We start, as before, by opening exactly one facility φ(κ) in the neighborhood of each
primary demand κ (Line 2). For any non-primary demand ν assigned to κ, we refer to
φ(κ) as the target facility of ν. In Algorithm EGUP, ν was connected to φ(κ), but in
Algorithm ECHS we may be able to find an open facility in ν’s neighborhood and connect
ν to this facility. Specifically, the two changes in the algorithm are as follows:
(1) Each facility µ that is not in the neighborhood of any primary demand is opened,
independently, with probability ȳµ (Lines 4–5). Notice that if ȳµ > 0 then, due to
completeness of the partitioned fractional solution, we have ȳµ = x̄µν for some demand
ν. This implies that ȳµ ≤ 1, because x̄µν ≤ 1, by (PS.1).
(2) When connecting demands to facilities, a primary demand κ is connected to the only
facility φ(κ) opened in its neighborhood, as before (Line 3). For a non-primary demand
ν, if its neighborhood N (ν) has an open facility, we connect ν to the closest open facility
in N (ν) (Line 8). Otherwise, we connect ν to its target facility (Line 10).

Analysis. We shall first argue that the integral solution thus constructed is feasible, and
then we bound the total cost of the solution. Regarding feasibility, the only constraint that
is not explicitly enforced by the algorithm is the fault-tolerance requirement; namely that
each client j is connected to rj different facilities. Let ν and ν 0 be two different sibling
demands of client j and let their assigned primary demands be κ and κ0 respectively. Due
to (SI.2) we know κ 6= κ0 . From (SI.1) we have N (ν) ∩ N (ν 0 ) = ∅. From (SI.2), we have
N (ν) ∩ N (κ0 ) = ∅ and N (ν 0 ) ∩ N (κ) = ∅. From (PD.1) we have N (κ) ∩ N (κ0 ) = ∅. It follows
that (N (ν) ∪ N (κ)) ∩ (N (ν 0 ) ∪ N (κ0 )) = ∅. Since the algorithm connects ν to some facility in
N (ν) ∪ N (κ) and ν 0 to some facility in N (ν 0 ) ∪ N (κ0 ), ν and ν 0 will be connected to different
facilities.
We now show that the expected cost of the computed solution is bounded by (1+2/e)·LP∗ .
By (PD.1), every facility may appear in at most one primary demand’s neighborhood, and
the facilities open in Line 4–5 of Pseudocode 3 do not appear in any primary demand’s
17

neighborhood. Therefore, by linearity of expectation, the expected facility cost of Algorithm ECHS is

where the third equality follows from (PS.3).
To bound the connection cost, we adapt an argument of Chudak and Shmoys [5]. Consider
a demand ν and denote by Cν the random variable representing the connection cost for ν.
Our goal now is to estimate E[Cν ], the expected value of Cν . Demand ν can either get
connected directly to some facility in N (ν) or indirectly to its target facility φ(κ) ∈ N (κ),
where κ is the primary demand to which ν is assigned. We will analyze these two cases
separately.
In our analysis, in this section and the next one, we will use notation

X
D(A, σ)=
dµσ ȳµ /

for the average distance between a demand σ and a set A of facilities. Note that, in particular,
we have Cνavg = D(N (ν), ν).
We first estimate the expected cost dφ(κ)ν of the indirect connection. Let Λν denote the
event that some facility in N (ν) is opened. Then
E[Cν | ¬Λν ] = E[dφ(κ)ν | ¬Λν ] = D(N (κ) \ N (ν), ν).

Note that ¬Λν implies that N (κ) \ N (ν) 6= ∅, since N (κ) contains exactly one open facility,
namely φ(κ).
Lemma 9. Let ν be a demand assigned to a primary demand κ, and assume that N (κ) \
N (ν) 6= ∅. Then
E[Cν | ¬Λν ] ≤ Cνavg + 2αν∗ .
Proof. By (3), we need to show that D(N (κ) \ N (ν), ν) ≤ Cνavg + 2αν∗ . There are two cases
to consider.
Case 1: There exists some µ0 ∈ N (κ) ∩ N (ν) such that dµ0 κ ≤ Cκavg . In this case, for every
µ ∈ N (κ) \ N (ν), we have
dµν ≤ dµκ + dµ0 κ + dµ0 ν ≤ ακ∗ + Cκavg + αν∗ ≤ Cνavg + 2αν∗ ,
using the triangle inequality, complementary slackness, and (PD.3(b)). By summing
over all µ ∈ N (κ) \ N (ν), it follows that D(N (κ) \ N (ν), ν) ≤ Cνavg + 2αν∗ .
Case 2: Every µ0 ∈ N (κ) ∩ N (ν) has dµ0 κ > Cκavg . Since Cκavg = D(N (κ), κ), this implies
that D(N (κ) \ N (ν), κ) ≤ Cκavg . Therefore, choosing an arbitrary µ0 ∈ N (κ) ∩ N (ν),
we obtain
D(N (κ) \ N (ν), ν) ≤ D(N (κ) \ N (ν), κ) + dµ0 κ + dµ0 ν ≤ Cκavg + ακ∗ + αν∗ ≤ Cνavg + 2αν∗ ,
where we again use the triangle inequality, complementary slackness, and (PD.3(b)).

Since the lemma holds in both cases, the proof is now complete.
We now continue our estimation of the connection cost. The next step of our analysis is
to show that

(4)
E[Cν ] ≤ Cνavg + αν∗ .
e
The argument is divided into three cases. The first, easy case is when ν is a primary demand
κ. According to the algorithm (see Pseudocode 3, Line 2), we have Cκ = dµκ with probability
ȳµ , for µ ∈ N (κ). Therefore E[Cκ ] = Cκavg , so (4) holds.
Next, we consider a non-primary demand ν. Let κ be the primary demand that ν is
assigned to. We first deal with the sub-case when N (κ) \ N (ν) = ∅, which is the same
as N (κ) P
⊆ N (ν). Property
P (CO) implies that x̄µν = ȳµ = x̄µκ for every µ ∈ N (κ), so
x̄
=
we have
µ∈N (κ) x̄µκ = 1, due to (PS.1). On the other hand, we have
µ∈N (κ) µν
P
µ∈N (ν) x̄µν = 1, and x̄µν > 0 for all µ ∈ N (ν). Therefore N (κ) = N (ν) and Cν has
exactly the same distribution as Cκ . So this case reduces to the first case, namely we have
E[Cν ] = Cνavg , and (4) holds.
The last, and only non-trivial case is when N (κ) \ N (ν) 6= ∅. We handle this case in the
following lemma.
Lemma 10. Assume that N (κ) \ N (ν) 6= ∅. Then the expected connection cost of ν, conditioned on the event that at least one of its neighbor opens, satisfies
E[Cν | Λν ] ≤ Cνavg .
Proof. The proof is similar to an analogous result in [5, 2]. For the sake of completeness we
sketch here a simplified argument, adapted to our terminology and notation. The idea is to
consider a different random process that is easier to analyze and whose expected connection
cost is not better than that in the algorithm.
We partition N (ν) into groups G1 , ..., Gk , where two different facilities µ and µ0 are put
in the same Gs , where s ∈ {1, . . . , k}, if they both belong to the same set N (κ) for some
primary demand κ. If some µ is not a neighbor of any primary demand, then it constitutes a
singleton group. For each s, let d¯s = D(Gs , ν) be the average distance from ν to Gs . Assume
that G1 , ..., Gk are ordered by nondecreasing average distance to ν, that isPd¯1 ≤ d¯2 ≤ ... ≤ d¯k .
For each group Gs , we select it, independently, with probability gs = µ∈Gs ȳµ . For each
selected group G
Ps , we open exactly one facility in Gs , where each µ ∈ Gs is opened with
probability ȳµ / η∈Gs ȳη .
So far, this process is the same as that in the algorithm (if restricted to N (ν)). However,
we connect ν in a slightly different way, by choosing the smallest s for which Gs was selected
and connecting ν to the open facility in Gs . This can only increase our expected connection
cost, assuming that at least one facility in N (ν) opens, so

Next, we show an estimate on the probability that none of ν’s neighbors is opened by
the algorithm.
Lemma 11. The probability that none of ν’s neighbors is opened satisfies P[¬Λν ] ≤ 1/e.
Proof. We use the same partition of N (ν) into groups G1 , ..., Gk as in the proof of Lemma 10.

facility), we have

We are now ready to estimate the unconditional expected connection cost of ν (in the
case when N (κ) \ N (ν) 6= ∅) as follows:
E[Cν ] = E[Cν | Λν ] · P[Λν ] + E[Cν | ¬Λν ] · P[¬Λν ]

demands ν of a client j, we can now bound the expected connection cost of client j:

E[Cj ] = ν∈j E[Cν ] ≤ ν∈j (Cνavg + 2e · αν∗ ) = Cj∗ + 2e · rj αj∗ .

Summarizing, we obtain the main result of this section.

7. Algorithm EBGS with Ratio 1.575
In this section we give our main result, a 1.575-approximation
algorithm for FTFP, where
γ
γ 1/e+1/e
1.575 is the value of minγ≥1 max{γ, 1 + 2/e , 1−1/γ }, rounded to three decimal digits. This
matches the ratio of the best known LP-rounding algorithm for UFL by Byrka et al. [3].
Recall that in Section 6 we showed how to compute an integral solution with facility cost
bounded by F ∗ and connection cost bounded by C ∗ + 2/e · LP∗ . Thus, while our facility cost
does not exceed the optimal fractional facility cost, our connection cost is significantly larger
than the connection cost in the optimal fractional solution. A natural idea is to balance
these two ratios by reducing the connection cost at the expense of the facility cost. One
way to do this would be to increase the probability of opening facilities, from ȳµ (used in
Algorithm ECHS) to, say, γ ȳµ , for some γ > 1. This increases the expected facility cost by
a factor of γ but, as it turns out, it also reduces the probability that an indirect connection
occurs for a non-primary demand to 1/eγ (from the previous value 1/e in ECHS). As a
consequence, for each primary demand κ, the new algorithm will select a facility to open
from the nearest facilities µ in N (κ) such that the connection values x̄µν sum up to 1/γ,
instead of 1 as in Algorithm ECHS. It is easily seen that this will improve the estimate
on connection cost for primary demands. These two changes, along with a more refined
analysis, are the essence of the approach in [3], expressed in our terminology.
Our approach can be thought of as a combination of the above ideas with the techniques
of demand reduction and adaptive partitioning that we introduced earlier. However, our
adaptive partitioning technique needs to be carefully modified, because now we will be using
a more intricate neighborhood structure, with the neighborhood of each demand divided into
two disjoint parts, and with restrictions on how parts from different demands can overlap.
We begin by describing properties that our partitioned fractional solution (x̄, ȳ) needs
to satisfy. Assume that γ is some constant such that 1 < γ < 2. As mentioned earlier, the
neighborhood N (ν) of each demand ν will be divided into two disjoint parts. The first part,
the facilities in N (ν) nearest to
called the close neighborhood and denoted N cls (ν), contains
P
ν with the total connection value equal 1/γ, that is µ∈N (ν) x̄µν = 1/γ. The second part,

the

(so µ∈N (ν) x̄µν = 1 − 1/γ). We restate these definitions formally below in Property (NB).

Our partitioned solution (x̄, ȳ) must satisfy the same partitioning and completeness
properties as before, namely properties (PS) and (CO) in Section 4. In addition, it must
satisfy a new neighborhood property (NB) and modified properties (PD’) and (SI’), listed
below.
(NB) Neighborhoods. For each demand ν ∈ C, its neighborhood is divided into close and
far neighborhood, that is N (ν) = N cls (ν) ∪ N far (ν), where
• N cls (ν) ∩ N far (ν) = ∅,
P
•
µ∈N (ν) x̄µν = 1/γ, and

• if µ ∈ N cls (ν) and µ0 ∈ N far (ν) then dµν ≤ dµ0 ν .

Note that the first two conditions, together with (PS.1), imply that µ∈N (ν) x̄µν =
far
1 − 1/γ. When defining N cls (ν), in case of ties, which can occur when some facilities
in N (ν) are at the same distance from ν, we use a tie-breaking rule that is explained
in the proof of Lemma 13 (the only place where the rule is needed).
(PD’) Primary demands. Primary demands satisfy the following conditions:
1. For any two different primary demands κ, κ0 ∈ P we have N cls (κ) ∩ N cls (κ0 ) = ∅.
P
P
2. For each site i ∈ F, κ∈P µ∈i∩N (κ) x̄µκ ≤ yi∗ . In the summation, as before, we

(b) Ccls

(SI’) Siblings. For any pair ν, ν 0 ∈ C of different siblings we have
1. N (ν) ∩ N (ν 0 ) = ∅.
2. If ν is assigned to a primary demand κ then N (ν 0 ) ∩ N cls (κ) = ∅. In particular,
by Property (PD’.3(a)), this implies that different sibling demands are assigned
to different primary demands, since N cls (ν 0 ) is a subset of N (ν 0 ).
Modified adaptive partitioning. To obtain a fractional solution with the above properties, we employ a modified adaptive partitioning algorithm. As in Section 4, we have two
phases. In Phase 1 we split clients into demands and create facilities on sites, while in Phase 2
we augment each demand’s connection values x̄µν so that the total connection value of each
22

demand ν is 1. As the partitioning algorithm proceeds, for any demand ν, N (ν) denotes
the set of facilities with x̄µν > 0; hence the notation N (ν) actually represents a dynamic
set which gets fixed once the partitioning algorithm concludes both Phase 2. On the other
hand, N cls (ν) and N far (ν) refer to the close and far neighborhoods at the time when N (ν)
is fixed.
Similar to the algorithm in Section 4, Phase 1 runs in iterations. Fix some iteration
e (j) is the neighborhood of j with respect to the yet
and consider any client j. As before, N
unpartitioned solution, namely the set of facilities µ such that x
eµj > 0. Order the facilities
e
in this set as N (j) = {µ1 , ..., µq } with non-decreasing distance from j, that is dµ1 j ≤ dµ2 j ≤
P
. . . ≤ dµq j . Without loss of generality, there is an index l for which ls=1 x
eµs j = 1/γ, since
e
we can always split one facility to achieve this. Then we define Ncls (j) = {µ1 , ..., µl }. (Unlike
ecls (j) can vary over time.) We also use notation

When the iteration starts, we first find a not-yet-exhausted client p that minimizes the
value of tcccls (p) + dmaxcls (p) and create a new demand ν for p. Now we have two cases:
ecls (p) ∩ N (κ) 6= ∅ for some existing primary demand κ ∈ P . In this case we

facilities in the intersection of N
At
P this time, the total connection value between ν and µ ∈ N (ν) is at most 1/γ, since
µ∈N (κ) ȳµ = 1/γ (this follows from the definition of neighborhoods for new primary
demands in Case 2 below) and we have N (ν) ⊆ N (κ) at this point. Later in Phase 2

It is easy to see that the total connection value of ν to N (ν) is now exactly 1/γ, that

final N cls (ν) contains the same set of facilities as the current set N (ν). (More precisely,
N cls (ν) consists of the facilities that either are currently in N (ν) or were obtained from
splitting the facilities currently in N (ν).)
Once all clients are exhausted, that is, each client j has rj demands created, Phase 1 concludes. We then run Phase 2, the augmenting phase, following the same steps as in Section 4.
23

For each P
client j and each demand ν ∈ j with total connection value to N (ν) less than 1
(that is, µ∈N (ν) x̄µν < 1), we use our AugmentToUnit() procedure to add additional
e (j) to N (ν) to make the total connection value
facilities (possibly split, if necessary) from N
between ν and N (ν) equal 1.
This completes the description of the partitioning algorithm. Summarizing, for each
client j ∈ C we created rj demands on the same point as j, and we created a number of
facilities at each site i ∈ F. Thus computed sets of demands and facilities are denoted C and
F, respectively. For each facility µ ∈ i we defined its fractional opening value ȳµ , 0 ≤ ȳµ ≤ 1,
and for each demand ν ∈ j we defined its fractional connection value x̄µν ∈ {0, ȳµ }. The
connections with x̄µν > 0 define the neighborhood N (ν). The facilities in N (ν) that are
closest to ν and have total connection value from ν equal 1/γ form the close neighborhood
N cls (ν), while the remaining facilities in N (ν) form the far neighborhood N far (ν). It remains
to show that this partitioning satisfies all the desired properties.
Correctness of partitioning. We now argue that our partitioned fractional solution (x̄, ȳ)
satisfies all the stated properties. Properties (PS), (CO) and (NB) are directly enforced by
the algorithm.

(PD’.1) holds because for each primary demand κ ∈ p, N cls (κ) is the same set as N
ecls (p) is removed from N

0
N (κ ) of all existing primary demands κ at that iteration, but these neighborhoods are the
same as the final close neighborhoods N cls (κ0 ).
The justification of (PD’.2) is similar to that for (PD.2) from Section 4. All close neighborhoods of primary demands are disjoint, due to (PD’.1), so each facility µ ∈ i can appear in
at most one N cls (κ), for some κ ∈ P . Condition (CO) implies that ȳP
µ = x̄µκ for µ ∈ N cls (κ).
As a result, the summation on the left-hand side is not larger than µ∈i ȳµ = yi∗ .
Regarding (PD’.3(a)), at first glance this property seems to follow directly from the
algorithm, as we only assign a demand ν to a primary demand κ when N (ν) at that iteration
overlaps with N (κ) (which is equal to the final value of N cls (κ)). However, it is a little more
subtle, as the final N cls (ν) may contain facilities added to N (ν) in Phase 2. Those facilities
e (j) (not N
ecls (j)) that we
may turn out to be closer to ν than some facilities in N (κ) ∩ N
added to N (ν) in Phase 1. If the final N cls (ν) consists only of facilities added in Phase 2, we
no longer have the desired overlap of N cls (κ) and N cls (ν). Luckily this bad scenario never
occurs. We postpone the proof of this property to Lemma 13. The proof of (PD’.3(b)) is
similar to that of Lemma 5, and we defer it to Lemma 14.
(SI’.1) follows directly from the algorithm because for each demand ν ∈ j, all facilities
e (j) and each facility is added to N (ν) of
added to N (ν) are immediately removed from N
exactly one demand ν ∈ j. Splitting facilities obviously preserves (SI’.1).
The proof of (SI’.2) is similar to that of Lemma 3. If κ = ν then (SI’.2) follows from
(SI’.1), so we can assume that κ 6= ν. Suppose that ν 0 ∈ j is assigned to κ0 ∈ P and consider
the situation after Phase 1. By the way we reassign facilities in Case 1, at this time we have
N (ν) ⊆ N (κ) = N cls (κ) and N (ν 0 ) ⊆ N (κ0 ) = N cls (κ0 ), so N (ν 0 ) ∩ N cls (κ) = ∅, by (PD’.1).

the caveat that the ties in the definition of N cls (ν) are broken in favor of the facilities in B.
(This is the tie-breaking rule that we mentioned in the definition of N cls (ν).) This will be
sufficient to prove the lemma because B 6= ∅, by the algorithm.
We now prove this claim. In this paragraph N (ν) denotes the final set N (ν) after both
phases are completed. Thus the total connection value of N (ν) to ν is 1. Note first that
B ⊆ N (ν) ⊆ A, because we never remove facilities from N (ν) and we only add facilities from
e (j). Also, B ∪ E − represents the facilities obtained from N
ecls (j), so P

This and B ⊆ N (ν) implies that the total connection value of B ∪ (N (ν) ∩ E − ) to ν is at
most 1/γ. But all facilities in B ∪ (N (ν) ∩ E − ) are closer to ν (taking into account our tie
25

breaking in property (NB)) than those in E + ∩N (ν). It follows that B ⊆ N cls (ν), completing
the proof.
Lemma 14. Property (PD’.3(b)) holds.
Proof. This proof is similar to that for Lemma 5. For a client j and demand η, we will write
tccηcls (j) and dmaxηcls (j) to denote the values of tcccls (j) and dmaxcls (j) at the time when η
was created. (Here η may or may not be a demand of client j).

final value of N cls (κ). So we have Ccls (κ) = tccκcls (p) and Ccls
since we choose p to minimize tcccls (p) + dmaxcls (p), we have that tccκcls (p) + dmaxκcls (p) ≤
tccκcls (j) + dmaxκcls (j).

completing the proof.
Now we have completed the proof that the computed partitioning satisfies all the required
properties.
Algorithm EBGS. The complete algorithm starts with solving the LP(1) and computing
the partitioning described earlier in this section. Given the partitioned fractional solution
(x̄, ȳ) with the desired properties, we start the process of opening facilities and making
connections to obtain an integral solution. To this end, for each primary demand κ ∈ P ,
we open exactly one facility φ(κ) in N cls (κ),
S where each µ ∈ N cls (κ) is chosen as φ(κ) with
probability γ ȳµ . For all facilities µ ∈ F − κ∈P N cls (κ), we open them independently, each
with probability γ ȳµ .
We claim that all probabilities are well-defined, that is γ ȳµ ≤ 1 for all µ. Indeed, if
ȳµ > 0 then ȳµ = x̄µν for some ν, by Property (CO). If µ ∈ N cls (ν) then the definition of
close neighborhoods implies that x̄µν ≤ 1/γ. If µ ∈ N far (ν) then x̄µν ≤ 1 − 1/γ ≤ 1/γ,
because γ < 2. Thus γ ȳµ ≤ 1, as claimed.
Next, we connect demands to facilities. Each primary demand κ ∈ P will connect to the
only open facility φ(κ) in N cls (κ). For each non-primary demand ν ∈ C − P , if there is an
open facility in N cls (ν) then we connect ν to the nearest such facility. Otherwise, we connect
ν to the nearest far facility in N far (ν) if one is open. Otherwise, we connect ν to its target
facility φ(κ), where κ is the primary demand that ν is assigned to.
Analysis. By the algorithm, for each client j, all its rj demands are connected to open
facilities. If two different siblings ν, ν 0 ∈ j are assigned, respectively, to primary demands κ,
κ0 then, by Properties (SI’.1), (SI’.2), and (PD’.1) we have
(N (ν) ∪ N cls (κ)) ∩ (N (ν 0 ) ∪ N cls (κ0 )) = ∅.
26

This condition guarantees that ν and ν 0 are assigned to different facilities, regardless whether
they are connected to a neighbor facility or to its target facility. Therefore the computed
solution is feasible.
We now estimate the cost of the solution computed by Algorithm EBGS. The lemma
below bounds the expected facility cost.
Lemma 15. The expectation of facility cost FEBGS of Algorithm EBGS is at most γF ∗ .
Proof. By the algorithm, each facility µ ∈ F is opened with probability γ ȳµ , independently
of whether it belongs to the close neighborhood of a primary demand or not. Therefore, by
linearity of expectation, we have that the expected facility cost is

where the third equality follows from (PS.3).
In the remainder of this section we focus on the connection cost. Let Cν be the random
variable representing the connection cost of a demand ν. Our objective is to show that the
expectation of ν satisfies

If ν is a primary demand then, due to the algorithm, we have E[Cν ] = Ccls
(ν) ≤ C avg (ν),
so (11) is easily satisfied.
Thus for the rest of the argument we will focus on the case when ν is a non-primary
demand. Recall that the algorithm connects ν to the nearest open facility in N cls (ν) if at
least one facility in N cls (ν) is open. Otherwise the algorithm connects ν to the nearest open
facility in N far (ν), if any. In the event that no facility in N (ν) opens, the algorithm will
connect ν to its target facility φ(κ), where κ is the primary demand that ν was assigned
to, and φ(κ) is the only facility open in N cls (κ). Let Λν denote the event that at least one
facility in N (ν) is open and Λνcls be the event that at least one facility in N cls (ν) is open.
¬Λν denotes the complement event of Λν , that is, the event that none of ν’s neighbors opens.
We want to estimate the following three conditional expectations:

E[Cν | Λνcls ],

E[Cν | Λν ∧ ¬Λνcls ],

and E[Cν | ¬Λν ],

and their associated probabilities.
We start with a lemma dealing with the third expectation, E[Cν | ¬Λν ] = E[dφ(κ)ν |
ν
Λ ]. The proof of this lemma relies on Properties (PD’.3(a)) and (PD’.3(b)) of modified
partitioning and follows the reasoning in the proof of a similar lemma in [3, 2]. For the sake
of completeness, we include a proof in Appendix A.
Lemma 16. Assuming that no facility in N (ν) opens, the expected connection cost of ν is

Proof. See Appendix A.
Next, we derive some estimates for the expected cost of direct connections. The next
technical lemma is a generalization of Lemma 10. In Lemma 10 we bound the expected
distance to the closest open facility in N (ν), conditioned on at least one facility in N (ν)
being open. The lemma below provides a similar estimate for an arbitrary set A of facilities
on that at least one facility in set A is open. Recall that D(A, ν) =

µ∈A µ is the average distance from ν to a facility in A.
Lemma 17. For any non-empty set A ⊆ N (ν), let ΛνA be the event that at least one facility
in A is opened by Algorithm EBGS, and denote by Cν (A) the random variable representing
the distance from ν to the closest open facility in A. Then the expected distance from ν to
the nearest open facility in A, conditioned on at least one facility in A being opened, is
E[Cν (A) | ΛνA ] ≤ D(A, ν).
Proof. The proof follows the same reasoning as the proof of Lemma 10, so we only sketch
it here. We start with a similar grouping of facilities in A: for each primary demand κ, if
N cls (κ)∩A 6= ∅ then N cls (κ)∩A forms a group. Facilities in A that are not in a neighborhood
of any primary demand form singleton groups. We denote these groups G1 , ..., Gk . It is clear
that the groups are disjoint because of (PD’.1). Denoting by d¯s = D(Gs , ν) the average
distance from ν to a group Gs , we can assume that these groups are ordered so that d¯1 ≤
... ≤ d¯k .
Each group can have at most one facility open and the events representing opening of
any two facilities that belong to different groups are independent. To estimate the distance
from ν to the nearest open facility in A, we use an alternative random process to make
connections, that is easier to analyze. Instead of connecting ν to the nearest open facility
in A, we will choose the smallest s for which Gs has an open facility and connect ν to this
facility. (Thus we selected an open facility with respect to the minimum d¯s , not the actual
distance from νPto this facility.) This can only increase the expected connection cost, thus
denoting gs = µ∈Gs γ ȳµ for all s = 1, . . . , k, and letting P[ΛνA ] be the probability that A
has at least one facility open, we have

(ν), and (b) E[Cν | Λν ∧ ¬Λνcls ] ≤ Cfar
Corollary 18. (a) E[Cν | Λνcls ] ≤ Ccls

Proof. When there is an open facility in N cls (ν), the algorithm connect ν to the nearest open
facility in N cls (ν). When no facility in N cls (ν) opens but some facility in N far (ν) opens, the
algorithm connects ν to the nearest open facility in N far (ν). The rest of the proof follows
from Lemma 17. By setting the set A in Lemma 17 to N cls (ν), we have
avg
(ν),
E[Cν | Λνcls ] ≤ D(N cls (ν), ν), = Ccls

proving part (a), and by setting the set A to N far (ν), we have
avg
E[Cν | Λν ∧ ¬Λνcls ] ≤ D(N far (ν), ν) = Cfar
(ν),

which proves part (b).
Given the estimate on the three expected distances when ν connects to its close facility
in N cls (ν) in (7), or its far facility in N far (ν) in (7), or its target facility φ(κ) in (12), the
only missing pieces are estimates on the corresponding probabilities of each event, which we
do in the next lemma. Once done, we shall put all pieces together and proving the desired
inequality on E[Cν ], that is (11).
The next Lemma bounds the probabilities for events that no facilities in N cls (ν) and
N (ν) are opened by the algorithm.
Lemma 19. (a) P[¬Λνcls ] ≤ 1/e, and (b) P[¬Λν ] ≤ 1/eγ .
Proof. (a) To estimate P[¬Λνcls ], we again consider a grouping of facilities in N cls (ν), as in the
proof of Lemma 17, according to the primary demand’s close neighborhood that they fall in,
with facilities not belonging to such neighborhoods forming their
Pown singleton
P groups. As
before, the groups are denoted G1 , . . . , Gk . It is easy to see that ks=1 gs = µ∈N (ν) γ ȳµ =
P cls
1. For any group Gs , the probability that a facility in this group opens is µ∈Gs γ ȳµ = gs
because in the algorithm at most one facility in a group can be chosenQ
and each is chosen
with probability γ ȳµ . Therefore the probability that no facility opens is ks=1 (1 − gs ), which
Pk
is at most e− s=1 gs = 1/e. Therefore we have P[¬ΛνA ] ≤ 1/e.

inequality (11).

Proof. Recall that, to connect ν, the algorithm uses the closest facility in N cls (ν) if one is
opened; otherwise it will try to connect ν to the closest facility in N far (ν). Failing that, it
will connect ν to φ(κ), the sole facility open in the neighborhood of κ, the primary demand
ν was assigned to. Given that, we estimate E[Cν ] as follows:
E[Cν ] = E[Cν | Λνcls ] · P[Λνcls ] + E[Cν | Λν ∧ ¬Λνcls ] · P[Λν ∧ ¬Λνcls ]

8. Final Comments
In this paper we show a sequence of LP-rounding approximation algorithms for FTFP,
with the best algorithm achieving ratio 1.575. As we mentioned earlier, we believe that
our techniques of demand reduction and adaptive partitioning are very flexible and should
be useful in extending other LP-rounding methods for UFL to obtain matching bounds for
FTFP.
One of the main open problems in this area is whether FTFL can be approximated with
the same ratio as UFL, and our work was partly motivated by this question. The techniques
we introduced are not directly applicable to FTFL, mainly because our partitioning approach
involves facility splitting that could result in several sibling demands being served by facilities
on the same site. Nonetheless, we hope that further refinements of our construction might
get around this issue and lead to new algorithms for FTFL with improved ratios.

Lemma 16 provides a bound on the expected connection cost of a demand ν when Algorithm EBGS does not open any facilities in N (ν), namely

which then implies (A.1) because Ccls
(ν) ≤ Cfar
(ν). The proof of (A.2) is similar to that
in [2]. For the sake of completeness, we provide it here, formulated in our terminology and
notation.
Assume that the event ¬Λν is true, that is Algorithm EBGS does not open any facility
in N (ν). Let κ be the primary demand that ν was assigned to. Also let

K = N cls (κ) \ N (ν),

Vcls = N cls (κ) ∩ N cls (ν) and Vfar = N cls (κ) ∩ N far (ν).

Then K, Vcls , Vfar form a partition of N cls (κ), that is, they are disjoint and their union is
N cls (κ). Moreover, we have that K is not empty, because Algorithm EBGS opens some
facility in N cls (κ) and this facility cannot be in Vcls ∪ Vfar , by our assumption. We also have
that Vcls is not empty due P
to (PD’.3(a)).P
Recall that D(A, η) = µ∈A dµη ȳµ / µ∈A ȳµ is the average distance between a demand
η and the facilities in a set A. We shall show that
avg

D(K, ν) ≤ Ccls

This is sufficient, because, by the algorithm, D(K, ν) is exactly the expected connection cost
for demand ν conditioned on the event that none of ν’s neighbors opens, that is the left-hand

side of (A.2). Further, (PD’.3(b)) states that Ccls
(κ) + Ccls
(κ) ≤ Ccls
(ν) + Ccls
(ν), and
thus (A.3) implies (A.2).
The proof of (A.3) is by analysis of several cases.
avg
(κ). For any facility µ ∈ Vcls (recall that Vcls 6= ∅), we have dµκ ≤
Case 1: D(K, κ) ≤ Ccls
avg
max

Ccls (κ) and dµν ≤ Ccls (ν) ≤ Cfar
(ν). Therefore, using the case assumption, we get
avg
avg

D(K, ν) ≤ D(K, κ) + dµκ + dµν ≤ Ccls

avg
Case 2: There exists a facility µ ∈ Vcls such that dµκ ≤ Ccls
(κ). Since µ ∈ Vcls , we infer
avg

that dµν ≤ Ccls (ν) ≤ Cfar (ν). Using Ccls (κ) to bound D(K, κ), we have D(K, ν) ≤

avg

D(K, κ) + dµκ + dµν ≤ Ccls

Case 3: In this case we assume that neither of Cases 1 and 2 applies, that is D(K, κ) >
avg
avg
Ccls
(κ) and every µ ∈ Vcls satisfies dµκ > Ccls

Ccls (κ) = D(N cls (κ), κ). Since sets K, Vcls and Vfar form a partition of N cls (κ), we obtain
avg
avg
that in this case Vfar is not empty and D(Vfar , κ) < Ccls
(κ). Let δ = Ccls
(κ)−D(Vfar , κ) > 0.
We now have two sub-cases:

Thus D(K, ν) ≤ D(K, κ) + dµκ + dµν ≤ Ccls

Case 3.2: D(Vfar , ν) > Cfar
(ν) + δ. The case assumption
Pimplies that Vfar is a proper subset
avg
of N far (ν), that is N far (ν) \ Vfar 6= ∅. Let ŷ = γ µ∈Vfar ȳµ . We can express Cfar
(ν)
using ŷ as follows

where the last step follows from 1 < γ < 2.

On the other hand, since K, Vcls , and Vfar form a partition of N cls (κ), we have Ccls
(κ) =
(1 − ŷ)D(K ∪ Vcls , κ) + ŷD(Vfar , κ). Then using the definition of δ we obtain

D(K ∪ Vcls , κ) = Ccls

Now we are essentially done. If there exists some µ ∈ Vcls such that dµκ ≤ Ccls

where we used (A.4) in the last step. Otherwise, from (A.5), we must have D(K, κ) ≤

This concludes the proof of (A.1). As explained earlier, Lemma 16 follows.
