Abstract
We consider the problem of deleting edges
from a Bayesian network for the purpose of
simplifying models in probabilistic inference.
In particular, we propose a new method for
deleting network edges, which is based on the
evidence at hand. We provide some interesting bounds on the KL-divergence between
original and approximate networks, which
highlight the impact of given evidence on the
quality of approximation and shed some light
on good and bad candidates for edge deletion. We finally demonstrate empirically the
promise of the proposed edge deletion technique as a basis for approximate inference.

INTRODUCTION

Classical algorithms for exact probabilistic inference
have a complexity which is parameterized by the network topology [Jensen et al., 1990; Lauritzen and
Spiegelhalter, 1988; Zhang and Poole, 1996; Dechter,
1996; Darwiche, 2001]. In particular, it is well known
that exact inference can be performed exponential only
in the treewidth of a given network, where treewidth
is a graph theoretic parameter that measures network
connectivity. When the treewidth is high, one may
then consider simplifying the network by deleting some
edges to reduce its treewidth and then run exact inference on the simplified network. This approach would
then lead to a class of approximate inference algorithms, which result from applying exact inference to
an approximate network.
Clearly, the quality of approximate inference in this
case would depend on the quality of approximate networks one constructs as a result of edge deletion. In
previous work on edge deletion, most results focused
on the quality of approximation between the prior distributions induced by the original and approximate

networks, typically by considering the KL–divergence
between the two [Cover and Thomas, 1991]. However,
it is known that the KL–divergence may be small between two distributions, yet blow up when conditioning on a particular evidence [Koller, 1996]. Therefore, bounding the KL–divergence would not necessarily provide guarantees on conditional queries.
In this paper, we propose an edge deletion method
which is sensitive to the available evidence. The
method was motivated by the following observations.
First, by deleting an edge Y → X from a network,
we are in essence changing the conditional probability
table (CPT) of variable X, since X will have one less
parent in the new network. Moreover, it is known that
if the current evidence e fixes the value of variable Y ,
then the edge Y → X can be deleted and the CPT for
X can be modified, while yielding a simpler network
which corresponds exactly to the original network for
any query of the form α, e. The question now is: what
if the current evidence does not fix the value of Y , but
the probability of Y is extreme given evidence e? Can
we in this case delete Y → X and still expect to get a
good approximate network? In particular, would the
approximate results converge to the exact ones as the
posterior of Y given e converges to an extreme distribution? We will indeed provide a bound and analysis
that give some interesting insights on this matter.
We also empirically evaluate the edge deletion methods
as a basis for approximate inference, by running exact
inference on the approximated network. This method
of approximate inference is interesting as it provides
a tradeoff between efficiency and quality of approximation, through control over the deleted edges. It is
therefore in the same spirit as generalized belief propagation [Yedidia et al., 2000], except that it is independent of the specific method used for exact inference.
As we shall see, the formulation based on edge deletion
appears to provide new grounds for analysis.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we
define the semantics of edge deletion. In Section 3,

we introduce some interesting bounds on the KL–
divergence between the original and approximate networks, for both deleting a single edge, and deleting
multiple edges. In Section 4 we address one of the
key subtleties relating to our edge deletion method,
and in Section 5 we present empirical results on an
approximate inference method based on edge deletion.
Section 6 discusses previous work in edge deletion, and
Section 7 closes with some concluding remarks. Proofs
of Theorems are included in the Appendix.

DELETING EDGES

Deleting an edge Y → X from a network entails more
than simply removing an edge from the graph; one
must also have a way of updating the CPT of variable
X, which has one less parent after deletion. Other notions of edge deletion studied in the past, which we will
review in Section 6, motivated their deletion by asserting, in a particular sense, a conditional independence
between Y and X. However, as these methods did not
specifically take evidence into account, an approximation may look good before conditioning on evidence,
but could potentially be a bad one afterwards.
Consider a variable Y in a network N and some evidence e that fixed the value of Y . We can then delete
each outgoing edge of Y , and assume the fixed value of
Y in the CPT of each of its children X. This method
will give a network with exact results for queries of the
form α, e. But what if the value of a variable is almost
determined by evidence e? Then perhaps we can try
to weight the CPT for X by the posterior probability
distribution of the parent Y .
Assume that we have a network N in which node X
has parents Y and U, where U may be empty. We
want to approximate this network by another, say N 0 ,
which results from removing the edge Y → X. This
approximation will be done given a piece of evidence e,
by replacing the CPT ΘX|Y U of variable X in network
N by the CPT Θ0X|U as defined below.
Definition 1 (Edge Deletion) Let N be a Bayesian
network with node X having parents Y and U. The
network N 0 which results from deleting edge Y → X
from N given evidence e is defined as follows:
• N 0 has the same structure as N except that edge
Y → X is removed.
• The CPT for variable X in N 0 is given by:
X
def
0
θx|yu Pr (y|e).
θx|u
=
y

• The CPTs for variables other than X in N 0 are
the same as those in N .

Note that this approximation assumes that we have
the posteriors Pr (Y |e) in the original network N . This
probability is typically not available, as the network
N must already be difficult, for us to be interested
in deleting some of its edges. We will indeed address
this point in Section 4, but for now we will pretend
that we have this posterior probability. Note also that
the probabilities Pr 0 (Y |e) in the approximate network
may not equal the original probabilities Pr (Y |e) when
the edge Y → X is cut as given above.
Intuitively, this edge deletion method is equivalent to
creating an auxiliary root node Y 0 whose CPT ΘY 0
is Pr (Y |e) and then replacing the original parent Y
with the new node Y 0 . This can be shown by eliminating variable Y 0 from the new network, which leads
to replacing the CPT of X by the one proposed in
Definition 1.

QUALITY OF APPROXIMATION

We consider in this section the quality of networks
generated by the proposed edge deletion method.
In particular, we provide bounds on the KL–divergence between the conditional distributions Pr (.|e)
and Pr 0 (.|e) induced by the original and approximate
networks N and N 0 , where KL is defined as follows
[Cover and Thomas, 1991]:

DELETING A SINGLE EDGE

Our intuition suggests that deleting an edge out of a
variable whose value is almost determined given the
evidence may yield a reasonable approximation. The
following bound lends some support to that intuition:
Theorem 1 Let N and N 0 be two Bayesian networks
as given in Definition 1. We then have:
KL(Pr (.|e), Pr 0 (.|e)) ≤ log

Pr 0 (e)
+ ENT (Y |e),
Pr (e)

where ENT (Y |e) is the entropy of Y given e, and is
defined as follows:
ENT (Y |e)

def

=

−

X

Pr (y|e) log Pr (y|e).

y

Note that the ENT (Y |e) = 0 if and only if Pr (y|e) = 1
for some y; that is, the entropy of Y given e is zero if
and only if the value of Y is determined. Now consider
the following condition in which our bound becomes an
equality:

Theorem 2 Let N and N 0 be two Bayesian networks
as given in Definition 1. If the CPT for variable X is
deterministic:
θx|yu ∈ {0, 1}
(1)
and
θx|yu = θx|y0 u = 1 only if y = y 0

(2)

then
KL(Pr (.|e), Pr 0 (.|e)) = log

Pr 0 (e)
+ ENT (Y |e).
Pr (e)

Note that Condition 2 is satisfied when the CPT for
X has no context–specific independence. Moreover,
both conditions are satisfied if X is a parity function
of its parents, as one typically finds, for example, in
networks for error-correcting codes [Frey and MacKay,
1997].
The more certain we are of the value of Y given e, the
more extreme Pr (Y |e) is, and the lower ENT (Y |e) is.
This suggests that if the value of Y is almost determined, then the ENT (Y |e) term in the bound on the
KL–divergence is negligible, and we may get a good
approximation. Moreover, the log Pr 0 (e)/Pr (e) term
may be negative, and the entropy term need not be
small for us to get a good approximation. However, as
we demonstrate in Appendix B, there are particular
situations where ENT (Y |e) can be arbitrarily close to
zero, but where log Pr 0 (e)/Pr (e) can be unbounded.
3.2

DELETING MULTIPLE EDGES

We can extend the bound given in Theorem 1 about a
single edge deletion, to a bound on multiple deletions,
where the entropy term is additive:
Theorem 3 Let N 0 be a network obtained from network N by deleting multiple edges Y → X as given by
Definition 1, deleting at most one incoming edge per
node X. Then
X
Pr 0 (e)
ENT (Y |e).
+
KL(Pr (.|e), Pr 0 (.|e)) ≤ log
Pr (e)
Y →X

Moreover, if the CPTs for each X satisfy Conditions 1
and 2, then
X
Pr 0 (e)
+
KL(Pr (.|e), Pr 0 (.|e)) = log
ENT (Y |e).
Pr (e)
Y →X

FIXED POINTS

Deleting edges Y → X by Definition 1 assumes that
we know the distribution on Y given e. If we are interested in approximating our network N , then computing Pr (Y |e) is itself likely to be difficult computationally. In the approximated network, however, computing the posteriors of Y is likely to be easy. We will

therefore use the approximate network to approximate
Pr (Y |e) using an iterative method as discussed below.
b is the network that we obtain by deletSuppose that N
c t=0 (Y |e) is
ing edges. We first assume that each Pr
uniform, and then cut edges Y → X by setting the
b as follows:
CPT for variable X in N

c t=0 (y|e).
θx|u

θx|yu Pr

We then apply exact inference to the approximate netc t (Y |e) are the posteriors of Y at iteration
work. If Pr
t in the approximate network, then the CPT for X is
updated as follows:
X

c t (y|e).

We repeat this process until we find that for all edges
c t (Y |e) = Pr
c t+1 (Y |e), or that
that we delete, all Pr
they are within some threshold  from one iteration to
the next. At this point, we say that we have converged,
c (Y |e) are a fixed point for N
b.
and that Pr

We will compare in the following section the quality of
our approximations when computed based on the true
posteriors Pr (Y |e) and the one obtained by the above
iterative method, showing that the fixed point method
tends to work quite well on the given benchmarks.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

We discuss here experimental results on edge deletion.
In particular, we compare iterative belief propagation
[Pearl, 1988; Murphy et al., 1999] as an approximate
inference algorithm, with exact inference on a network
with deleted edges. Moreover, we compare the deletion of edges Y → X based on the true probabilites
c (Y |e).
Pr (Y |e) and the fixed point probabilites Pr

We use the jointree algorithm to perform exact inference on the network with deleted edges. Moreover, we
make the following choices in our experiments.
Cost of computation: We use the largest cluster size
in the jointree to measure the difficulty of exact inference. For belief propagation, we assume that difficulty
depends on the number of loops to observe convergence, where the complexity of each loop depends on
the number and sizes of the network CPT’s, and in
particular, the size of the largest CPT.
Deleted edges: For each network we consider, we cut
different sets of edges to control the size of the largest
cluster in the corresponding jointree. We do this by
fixing a variable order that induces a jointree.1 We
1

We use min-fill/min-size heuristics, or by using orders
found otherwise. For example, orders are available for networks in Aalborg DSS’s repository.

Evidence: For each of a given number of trials (typically 50 to 200 trials), we set evidence on all leaves by
sampling based on the prior probabilities of each individual variable, to approximately simulate evidence
that we may likely observe.
Convergence: For each piece of evidence, we approximate inference by belief propagation and by edge deletion for a given set of thresholds on the largest cluster size. When appropriate, we decide on convergence
when the marginal of every variable of an iteration is
within 10−8 of the previous iteration, trying at most
100 iterations. If we do not observe convergence within
this many iterations, we evaluate the instance based on
the state of the network in its last iteration.

son, the iterative version of edge deletion always converged within 100 iterations for all trials, and took
16 iterations on average for this network. When
we use a threshold on the maximum cluster size of
log2 40, 320 = 15.30 or smaller, the largest tables computed during belief propagation and edge deletion are
of comparable sizes, but edge deletion still needs only
21 iterations on average to converge.

then delete edges to find an approximated network
which has a jointree whose largest cluster is smaller
than given thresholds, using the same variable ordering. We decide on edges to delete based on a heuristic based on reducing bucket sizes to satisfy a given
threshold in a bucket elimination procedure [Dechter,
1996].

Figure 1: Loops until convergence in barley network
First consider the barley network, which has a jointree with a normalized maximum cluster size of about
22.79, which is the log2 of the number of entries in the
largest table of a cluster. The barley network also has
a large CPT containing 40, 320 entries. Although the
largest cluster in the jointree still has 180 times more
entries then the largest CPT in the network, if belief
propagation takes many iterations to converge, we get
an approximation of posterior marginals, but with less
attractive benefits in time savings.
Consider Figure 1, which compares the average number of loops required until convergence. In 70 trials,
belief propagation converges in less than half the instances when given 100 iterations to converge, taking 86 iterations on average overall. In compari-

We judge the quality of approximation with two measures. One measure is in terms of the average number
of flips observed in a trial. We say that a flip occurs
when the most likely state of an individual variable
with respect to the original posterior distribution is
no longer the most likely state in the approximated
one. The other measure is in terms of the average KL–
divergence between the true and approximated conditional probabilities of non-evidence variables. Note
that in our figures, curves are not always smooth, since
different thresholds yield different sets of edges deleted,
and smaller sets of edges deleted do not necessarily
yield more accurate approximations.
Consider first Figure 2, which compares the quality of
the approximation given by edge deletion and belief
propagation in the barley network, based on the KL–
divergence. We see in this case, both methods of edge
deletion compare favorably to belief propagation for
all given thresholds on the cluster size. At a threshold
of 22, we find that the largest cluster size of the approximation is 20.47, and so the number of entries in
that cluster table is 20% the size of that in the original
network. With a threshold of 20, the largest table is
3.54% the size; with a threshold of 10, it is 7.72·10−3 %
the size.
Figures 3 and 4 compare the quality of approximations
in the munin1 and munin3 networks. We observe that
the quality of approximation tends to degrade with a
stricter threshold on the largest cluster size. Note that

we are deciding on which edges to delete without regard to the particular instantiation of evidence, and we
see that our approximation schemes compare favorably
to belief propagation to a point, with varying degrees
of computational savings. In munin3, both methods of
edge deletion compare favorably against belief propagation, in both measures, up until a threshold of 11.
The largest normalized cluster size in the original network is 17.26 compared to 10.97 in the approximated
network at that threshold. Thus, the largest table in
the jointree for the approximated network is 1.28% of
that of the original network.
In most of our experiments, we tend to observe that
the iterative version of edge deletion is very close to
the version that uses the true probabilities Pr (Y |e) for
larger thresholds, and typically fewer edges deleted,
and become less comparable for smaller and smaller
thresholds. In munin3, they perform similarly over
most of the given thresholds. In munin1, we see that
both versions of edge deletion are comparable up to a

point, where the iterative method tends to fare worse
for smaller thresholds.
Figure 5 provides a summary of the comparisons between our methods of approximation. In these tables,
we measure how belief propagation performs in terms
of the average percentage of flips observed, and by
average KL(Pr (X|e), Pr 0 (X|e)) over all non-evidence
variables. We then find the threshold on the maximum
cluster size in which edge deletion using true probabilities Pr (Y |e) compares favorably to belief propagation, and report the savings in cluster size with respect to the cluster size of the original network. We
also report the quality of approximation for the iterative version of edge deletion that uses fixed point
c (Y |e), for the same threshold. We find
probabilities Pr
that both versions of edge deletion compare well with
belief propagation, and can do so with substantial degrees of computational savings in terms of reduction of
the largest cluster size. Further, we see that when deletion with true probabilities Pr (Y |e) does well, deletion

PREVIOUS WORK
7

Prior work in approximating Bayesian networks by
edge deletion focused primarily on the effects of deletion on the prior distribution. In [Kjærulff, 1994],
edges are deleted, not in the model itself, but on the
moralized independence graph induced by the network, and its simplifications are specific to jointree
based algorithms. Weak dependencies are sought between pairs of variables within particular cliques of the
jointree, and a conditional independence is asserted
based on the variables that appear in the clique. The
author showed that the KL–divergence between the
original distribution and the one where a conditional
independence is asserted is equal to the conditional
mutual information [Cover and Thomas, 1991] of the
variables involved. He further showed that the KL–
divergence is additive, and that for each conditional independence asserted, the divergence is computable locally. It is possible to recover a model from the approximated jointree, but the structure may not be unique,
and the parameterization for it may not be easily determined. The divergence is for prior distributions,
and a form for the posterior distribution was cited as
future work. More recently, [Paskin, 2003] effectively
employed this simplification in a Gaussian graphical
model for simultaneous localization and mapping for
mobile robotics.
In [van Engelen, 1997], edges are deleted in the model,
as we did here. For a node X with parents Y U, we
can cut edge Y → X by replacing each θx|yu with
0
θx|u
= Pr (x|u); essentially, we are asserting that X
and Y are conditionally independent given U. The
KL–divergence between the prior distributions is again
the conditional mutual information, and is additive if
we delete at most a single incoming edge per node.
However, to make this approximation, one must be
able to compute the quantities Pr (x|u). Although
these are local quantities, they may require global com-

CONCLUSION

We proposed a method for deleting edges from a
Bayesian network, which is sensitive to the evidence
at hand. We provided some bounds on the KL–
divergence between the original and approximated network, given evidence. The bounds shed light on when
this method is expected to provide good approximations. We also evaluated empirically an approximate
inference algorithm which is based on deleting edges
against belief propagation, and showed that the edge
deletion method holds good promise. The method
we used to decide on which edges to delete is a bit
primitive, as it is based on a fixed variable order and
does not exploit the given evidence for making its
choices. We are currently working on a more sophisticated scheme for this purpose, which may significantly
improve the quality of approximations obtained by the
proposed method of edge deletion.

PROOFS

Say we want to compare network N with a network
N 0 by deleting edges in N ; we can analyze and compare the two as if they had the same structure. For
example, say node X has parents Y U; if we wanted
to delete Y → X in N , then a network N 0 would
have a CPT Θ0X|Y U instead of Θ0X|U where for all y,

θx|yu
= θx|u
. For the sake of analysis, we shall assume
that we “delete” edges in this manner from here on.

If the CPT of X is deterministic, then Pr (x|yue) =

Only the CPT’s for variables X for the edges Y → X
we delete are different. We delete at most one edge
incoming per node, so each edge deleted corresponds
to a unique CPT, and we have:

Suppose now that θx|yu = θx|y0 u = 1 only if y = y 0 .
Since θxyu |yu = 1, we must have θxyu |y0 u = 0. Hence,

EXAMPLE

Say network N has binary variables X, Y, Z, whose
structure is implicit in the parametrization where
θx|y = θx̄|ȳ = 1, θz|xy = θz|x̄ȳ and θz|xȳ = θz|x̄y = 1.
We get the following joint probability distributions induced by N and by N 0 from deleting edge Y → X in
N both conditioned on evidence Z = z:

Thus, if we set θz|xy = (2 · θy θȳ )2 , then we get that:

We have that Pr (y|e) = θy , Pr (e) = θz|xy and that

Proof of Theorem 3. First we generalize Theorem 4
to multiple changes:

Proof of Theorem 2. Suppose that θx|yu ∈ {0, 1}.
Then for each yu, there is a unique x, call it xyu ,
for which θxyu |yu = 1. Note that Pr (xyu |yue) =
Pr (xyu |yu) = θxyu |yu = 1 in this case. Then, for a
given yu, we have

So, as θy , and thus ENT (Y |e), goes to zero, we can
set paramater θz|xy so that log Pr (e)/Pr 0 (e) goes to
infinity.
