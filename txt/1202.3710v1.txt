Abstract
Prediction markets provide an eﬃcient means
to assess uncertain quantities from forecasters. Traditional and competitive strictly
proper scoring rules have been shown to incentivize players to provide truthful probabilistic forecasts. However, we show that
when those players can cooperate, these
mechanisms can instead discourage them
from reporting what they really believe.
When players with diﬀerent beliefs are able to
cooperate and form a coalition, these mechanisms admit arbitrage and there is a report
that will always pay coalition members more
than their truthful forecasts. If the coalition
were created by an intermediary, such as a
web portal, the intermediary would be guaranteed a profit.

Introduction

Decision makers need to understand and evaluate complex decision problems with considerable uncertainties.
Those uncertainties are integrated into decision models as forecasts in the form of probability distributions,
and the analysis is often quite sensitive to the distributions used. Statistical analysis can support this process
when there is suﬃcient relevant historical data. However, in many cases, decision makers must rely instead
on the judgment of experts to obtain useful probabilistic forecasts.
In many applications of decision analysis, multiple individual judgments are engaged. Even when the decision maker has her own belief about the uncertainties,
she can benefit by integrating the judgments of others.
Incorporating diverse views from heterogeneous disciplines has been shown to improve assement accuracy
(Clemen 1989, Hoﬀmann et al. 2007). Several approaches have been developed in the literature to find

optimal combinations of multiple individuals’ judgements (Clemen and Winkler 1999, Stone 1961, Morris
1977).
A strictly proper scoring rule measures the quality of
a probabilistic forecast based on the observed outcome
(Winkler 1996). It can be used, ex post, to evaluate
the quality of forecasters (Brier 1950), or, ex ante, to
encourage forecasters to articulate their best possible
report (Savage 1971). In either case, a scoring rule
captures the accuracy, calibration, knowledge, and expertise in assessment, encouraging a forecaster to be
careful and honest.
A decision maker who needs more knowledge about a
particular uncertainty can retain a panel of experts.
Each expert reports his forecast to her, and his payment can depend on the observed state, his report, and
the other reports, too. Although her contract with the
experts can provide a risk-free subsidy, it can also have
incentives for superior forecasts (Clemen 2002).
In recent years, prediction markets have been created
and several market designs have been developed (Pennock 2004, Peters et al. 2006, Agrawal et al. 2009).
Prediction markets can elicit forecasts by aggregating the reports from many anonymous players integrating their combined information (Berg and Rietz
2003). Some prominent prediction markets are Iowa
Electronic Markets, which focuses on political election, Hollywood Stock Exchange, which focuses on
movies, NewsFutures.com, which covers politics, finance, sports and current international events. It has
been shown that forecasts from public prediction markets strongly correlate with observed outcomes (Pennock et al. 2001, Servan-Schreiber et al. 2004).
The most popular type of contract in prediction markets is winner-take-all, where a player is paid if and
only if a specific event occurs (Wolfers and Zitzewitz
2004). A winner-take-all market does not induce truthful individual reports. Depending on the assumptions
made, the equilibrium price of a prediction market is

either a particular quantile of the budget-weighted distribution of players’ beliefs (Manski 2006) or the mean
of those beliefs (Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2005).

2

Strictly proper scoring rules have also been applied to
groups of forecasters, where the payment depends on
the forecaster’s score relative to others. Hanson (2003)
introduced market scoring rules where the market subsidizes the process. Kilgour and Gerchak (2004) developed competitive scoring rules which are self-financing
regardless of the number of players, their forecasts,
or the outcome. Johnstone (2007) elaborated the relationship between the Kilgour-Gerchak logarithmic
scoring rules and the rewards from Kelly betting competition. Lambert et al. (2008) proposed weightedscore mechanisms, a modified form of Kilgour-Gerchak
competitive scoring rules, which ensure budget balance
and non-negative payments.

A decision maker is concerned about a random variable E with m mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive states given by Ω = {E1 , E2 , ..., Em }.
There are n forecasters or players, indexed by N =
{1, 2, ..., n}, who report probabilistic forecasts for E.

forecasts

In this paper we explore payments for probabilistic
forecasts, either from a panel of experts or in a prediction market. We consider strictly proper mechanisms,
both traditional and competitive scoring rules, which
have been shown to encourage forecasters to report
their true beliefs when acting independently. We show
that when forecasters with diﬀerent beliefs are able to
cooperate and form a coalition, these mechanisms admit arbitrage. A similar result for concave traditional
scoring rules was suggested by French (1985). These
mechanisms actually discourage the coalition members
from reporting their true beliefs because they are guaranteed to receive more when they coordinate their reports. If the coalition were created by an intermediary, such as a web portal, without the knowledge of
the players, the intermediary would be guaranteed a
profit.
It should not be surprising that mechanisms that encourage individuals acting alone to report honestly, do
otherwise when players can cooperate. This is similar to results with auctions. Although second-price
auctions are incentive-compatible for individuals, cooperation among bidders is a dominant strategy that
aﬀects the reserve price for the auction (Graham and
Marshall 1987). Auctions with intermediaries are similary influenced by cooperative behavior (Feldman et
al. 2010). Such cooperation is diﬃcult to detect and
ambiguous to prove (McAfee and McMillan 1992).
In section 2 of this paper, we present the fundamental
notation and earlier results for traditional and competitive scoring rules. We build on them to show how
strictly proper mechanisms admit arbitrage under cooperation for traditional and competitive scoring rules,
in sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, we conclude
and present some future research in section 5.

Traditional and Competitive Scoring
Rules

j=1

player i ∈ N believes that the event will occur according with probability pi = (pi1 , ..., pim ) ∈ ∆m but
reports ri ∈ ∆m to the decision maker, where ri is
not necessarily equal to pi . We say that the players
in C ⊆ N agree if p1 = pi for all i ∈ C, and that
otherwise they disagree. The decision maker pays the
players according to a contract function, denoted by
Π : (∆m )n × Ω → Rn based on the reports of all
players and the observed state, so player i receives
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ).
A traditional scoring rule, S : ∆m × Ω → R, assigns
a real-valued score based solely on the player’s report
and the observed state. If the decision maker pays
player i
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = wi S (ri , Ej ),
when Ej ∈ Ω is observed, where weight wi > 0, Π is
said to be a contract function for scoring rule S. A
scoring rule S is said to be strictly proper for player i
if
m

pij Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej )

j=1

whenever pi �= ri , for all i and all pi , r1 , ..., rn ∈ ∆m .
Thus, under a a strictly proper mechanism, a risk neutral player should report his true belief in order to maximize his expected score. Savage (1971) showed that
scoring rule S is strictly proper if and only if
S (ri , Ej ) = G(ri ) − ∇G(ri )ri + ∇j G(ri )

(1)

for j = 1, ..., m, where G : ∆m → R is a continuously
diﬀerentiable strictly convex function.
The three strictly proper scoring rules most commonly
used in the literature are the quadratic (or Brier),
logarithmic, and spherical rules: (Winkler 1996, Jose
2008):

2

Quadratic: S (ri , Ej ) = aj + b(2rij − �ri � ),

Although these mechanisms are all strictly proper
in the sense that each player, acting independently,
should report his true beliefs in order to maximize his
expected score, we will show that is not the case when
he can cooperate with other players.

Of the three most common scoring rules, the quadratic
and spherical are bounded, but the logarithmic has no
lower bound, which makes it less attractive as a contract payment. Therefore we propose a new strictly
proper scoring rule, a generalized logarithmic score
given by
Generalized Logarithmic:
S (ri , Ej ) = aj + b log(rij + l) + bl

m

log(rik + l),

which is equal to the logarithmic score when l = 0 and
bounded when l > 0 for any aj and any b > 0.
Kilgour and Gerchak (2004) construct a self-financing
competitive scoring rule, where the total of the contract
functions for all players is zero. Their contract function
assigns a score based on the relative quality of each
forecast compared to the other forecasts. If Ej ∈ Ω is
observed, player i receives Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) determined
by

Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = S (ri , Ej ) −

Lambert et al. (2008) propose a similar weighted-score
mechanism, denoted by
wi �
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = wi S (ri , Ej ) −

wN
k∈N

(4)
where weight wi > 0 can now be interpreted
as
the
�
wager chosen by player i and wC = k∈C wk for any
C ⊆ N . They require that scoring rule S be bounded,
mapping into [0, 1], to ensure that player i never loses
more than his wager wi . If a scoring rule S is strictly
proper, then so are the corresponding Kilgour-Gerchak
rule and weighted-score mechanisms (Kilgour and Gerchak, 2004; Lambert et al. 2008).
Hanson’s market scoring rule (2003) is also strictly
proper. Player i reports his forecast and is paid based
on that report and the report from the player who preceded him, i − 1, according to the following contract
rule:
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = S (ri , Ej ) − S (ri−1 , Ej ).

Arbitrage with Traditional Scoring
Rules

Given a contract function for a strictly proper scoring
rule, we show how players should behave when they
are allowed to cooperate. Suppose that two or more
players form a coalition, C ⊆ N of size c = |C| ≥
2. We show that in a variety of circumstances, even
under a strictly proper mechanism, coalition members
who disagree about the forecasts will all be better oﬀ
coordinating their reports than reporting truthfully.
We say that contract Π admits arbitrage for coalition
C if, for any pi ∈ ∆m for all i ∈ C where the players in
C disagree, there are ri ∈ ∆m for all i ∈ C such that
�
�
Πi (p1 , ..., pn , Ej ) <
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej )
i∈C

i∈C

for all j and all pk = rk ∈ ∆m for all k ∈
/ C. We compare reports from coalition members with their true
beliefs given any possible reports from those outside
the coalition.
The contract Π admits arbitrage with identical reports
if q = ri for all i ∈ C for some q.

If a contract admits arbitrage for coalition C, then
whenever coalition members disagree about E the total payments to the coalition members will always be
greater ex post reporting ri rather than pi , regardless
which outcome is observed and what the other players
report. We call the additional payment to the coalition
members the surplus from cooperation.
3.1

Scoring Rules for Binary Events

We consider a binary event sample space Ω = {E1 , E2 },
so that each there is a single parameter ri for player
i to report, ri = (ri , 1 − ri ) and the player’s belief
about E1 is characterized by pi , pi = (pi , 1 − pi ). A
traditional strictly proper score S for a binary event
can be generally represented by
S (ri , E1 ) = G(ri ) + (1 − ri )G� (ri ),
S (ri , E2 ) = G(ri ) − ri G� (ri ),

where ri is the reported probability report for E1 and G
is a continuously diﬀerentiable strictly convex function
(Savage 1971).
Theorem 1 (Arbitrage with Binary E). Given binary
E, any contract function for a strictly proper scoring

rule admits arbitrage with identical reports. Whenever
coalition members maximizing their payments disagree
about E they should not report their true beliefs.
Proof. We will show that the contract function
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = S(ri , Ej ) admits arbitrage with
identical reports q for any coalition C with c ≥ 2, where
q satisfies
� wi
G� (q) =
G� (pi ).

Theorem 2 (Arbitrage with Strictly Concave Scoring Rule). Any contract function for a strictly concave scoring rule admits arbitrage with identical reports. Whenever coalition members maximizing their
payments disagree about E they should not report their
true beliefs.
Proof. Consider contract function Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) =
wi S(ri , Ej ) and let the identical reports be

i∈C

G strictly convex implies that G� is strictly increasing.
Therefore, by the intermediate-value-theorem there exists a unique such q, mini∈C pi < q < maxi∈C pi .
Given such a q, there is the same surplus from cooperation no matter which state of E is observed, and
because G is strictly convex, the surplus is strictly positive when the coalition members disagree,

Examples of Traditonal Strictly Proper
Scoring Rules

The three most commonly used strictly proper scoring
rules are the quadratic, logarithmic and spherical rules.
The contract function for these scoring rules admits arbitrage with identical reports for any coalitions. Under
all three, when players are able to cooperate they can
be discouraged from reporting their true beliefs. The
results of this section are summarized in Table 1.
Example 1 (Quadratic Scoring Rule). The quadratic
scoring rule for event E is S (ri , Ej ) = aj + b(2rij −
2
�ri � ). It is strictly concave with respect to ri , so it
admits arbitrage with identical reports
q=

In this case, the surplus from cooperation is the same
for all outcome states Ej ,

wi S (q, Ej ) −

Strictly Concave Scoring Rules

In this section, we consider contract functions for
strictly concave scoring rules when E has m ≥ 2 possible states. These include quadratic and generalized
logarithmic scoring rules, but spherical scoring rules
are not concave. We show that strictly concave scoring rules admit arbitrage for all coalitions, as suggested
by French (1985).

This surplus comes from the total variation among
the coalition members’ probabilities, a second moment
analogous to variance. It is positive unless they agree
on E and it increases when there is more disagreement among the coalition members. For example, if

there were two members who disagreed about a binary
event, believing probabilities 0.2 and 0.8 for E1 , their
surplus from cooperating and reporting 0.5 instead of
their true beliefs would be nine times the surplus they
would receive if they had believed 0.4 and 0.6 and reported 0.5. Their disagreement is three times larger
and the surplus is therefore 32 larger.
Example 2 (Generalized Logarithmic Scoring Rule).
The generalized logarithmic scoring�
rule for event E
m
is S (ri , Ej ) = aj + b log(rij + l) + bl k=1 log(rik + l),
where l = 0 corresponds to the traditional logarithmic scoring rule. Because it is concave, by Theorem
2 it admits arbitrage with identical reports, equal to
the weighted arithmetic mean of the coalition members’ forecasts, for any coalition. However, it is more
instructive to consider identical reports equal to the
normalized weighted geometric mean,

regardless of the observed outcome, and is strictly

(pij + l) = 1 + ml, thus the equation

(8) is strictly positive.
Example 3 (Spherical Scoring Rule). The spherical
scoring rule for event E, S (ri , Ej ) = aj + brij /�ri �,
also admits arbitrage with identical reports for any
coalition. However, a spherical score is not a concave
function, and the arithmetic mean does not always lead
to arbitrage. For example, if there were two members
who disagreed about a binary event, believing probabilities 0.1 and 0.4 for E1 , although they would always
be better oﬀ both reporting 0.275 than reporting their
true beliefs, they are not always better oﬀ reporting
the arithmetic mean 0.25.
Theorem 3 (Arbitrage with Spherical Scoring Rule).
Any contract function for a spherical scoring rule
admits arbitrage with identical reports. Whenever
coalition members maximizing their payments disagree
about E they should not report their true beliefs.
The proof is given in the Appendix. It shows that there
is an identical report q ∈ ∆m with components

Arbitrage with Competitive Scoring
Rules

In Section 3 we showed that contracts for strictly
proper scoring rules admit arbitrage when players can
cooperate. We build on those results in this section
to show how competitive mechanisms, shown to be
strictly proper when players act independently, also
admit arbitrage when players can cooperate. As a result, such mechanisms can discourage coalition members from reporting truthful forecasts whenever they
disagree.
4.1

Self-Financed Competitive Mechanisms

We consider a self-financed competitive mechanism
with contract function given by
wi �
Πi (r1 , ..., rn , Ej ) = wi S (ri , Ej )−
wk S (rk , Ej ),
wN
k∈N

(11)
where the traditional scoring rule S is strictly proper
and the wagers wi > 0 are positive. This mechanism is
self-financing, with contract functions summing to zero
in all outcome states. It generalizes both the KilgourGerchak and Lambert mechanisms for the purposes of
this paper. If all of the wagers are equal, wi = w1
for all i ∈ N , this is the Kilgour-Gerchak competitive
scoring rule. If the range of the scoring rule is restricted to [0, 1], then it is the Lambert weighted-score
mechanism, and each player i never loses more than
his wager, Πi > −wi .
Theorem 4 (Arbitrage with Self-Financed Competitive Mechanism). Given that the contract function for
a strictly proper scoring rule admits arbitrage, any selffinanced competitive mechanism using the same scoring rule admits arbitrage for any coalition including at
least two but not all of the players. Whenever coalition
members maximizing their payments disagree about E
they should not report their true beliefs.
Proof. Suppose that the contract function admits arbitrage for coalition C with each player i ∈ C believing
pi and reporting ri , while each player k ∈
/ C reports rk

Thus the competitive mechanism admits arbitrage for
the coalition provided wC < wN .
We have shown that there is surplus from cooperation
for both the Kilgour-Gerchak competitive scoring rule
and the Lambert weighted-score mechanism. In prediction markets, it would be diﬃcult to prevent players
from cooperating, and they could in fact do so without
even knowing it. An intermediary, such as a web portal, can create a coalition among players, and exploit
the surplus from cooperation that comes from bringing
together forecasters who disagree. Such an intermediary can provide a convenient service for players who
want to enter their forecasts into the prediction market, reimbursing them as if their forecasts were actually
entered into the market. However, if the intermediary
instead submits identical reports for each of them, or
one large wager with that report, he would be guaranteed a profit if any of the players disagree, even if he

had no knowledge about the uncertainty. The players
might be unaware they had participated in a coalition.
Next we consider how large a coalition should be to
maximize the expected surplus.
Theorem 5 (Optimal Coalition Size). Given that a
large number of players n are participating with equal
wagers, their forecasts are believed to be exchangeable,
and the contract admits arbitrage with identical reports,
the ideal size for a coalition C in order to maximize the
expected surplus from cooperation includes all players
under a contract for a strictly proper scoring rule, and
half of the wagers, wC = 12 wN , under a self-financed
competitive mechanism.

Proof. For a large enough population, the identical report for members of the coalition q would not depend
on the size of the coalition. Therefore, the expected
surplus from cooperation under a contract for a scoring rule when Ej is observed is
�
i∈C

�

wi S(q, Ej ) −

�

pi ∈∆m

�
�
= wC S(q, Ej ) −

�

S(pi , Ej )dF (pi )

p∈∆m

�
S(p, Ej )dF (p) ,

which is proportional to wC and it is maximized by including all players. If players are paid by a self financed
competitive mechnism, the expected surplus from co-

operation when Ej is observed is
�

�

wC

1−
wC S(q, Ej ) − S(p, Ej )dF (p) .
wN
p
This is proportional to wC (wN − wC ). Therefore, it is
maximized when wC = 12 wN .
In a contract for a scoring rule, the surplus from cooperation is proportional to the size of the coalition,
and the surplus is largest with all players cooperating.
However, under a competitive mechanism the surplus
comes from the players outside the coalition and from
the variation among the players within it, and therefore the surplus is largest when half of the wagers are
from members, wC = 12 wN . Note that if our objective
were to maximize the surplus per member, i.e. the total surplus from cooperation divided by the size of the
coalition, we would prefer a smaller coalition.
4.2

Market Scoring Rules

We now consider Hanson’s market scoring rule, which
combines the advantages of scoring rules and standard
information markets, and show conditions under which
cooperating players maximizing their total payment
are discouraged from reporting their true forecasts.
Theorem 6 (Arbitrage with Market Scoring Rules).
Given that the contract function for a strictly proper
scoring rule admits arbitrage, a market scoring rule
using the same scoring rule admits arbitrage for any
coalition C ⊆ N if players outside the coalition report before each coalition member, and those players’
reports are independent of the coalition members’ reports. Whenever coalition members maximizing their
payments disagree about E they should not report their
true beliefs.
Proof. Suppose that the contract function admits arbitrage for coalition C with each player i ∈ C believing
pi and reporting ri , while each player k ∈
/ C reports
rk . For any observed outcome Ej the surplus from
cooperation is
�
[S (ri , Ej ) − S (ri−1 , Ej )]
i∈C

−
=

�
i∈C

�
i∈C

[S (pi , Ej ) − S (ri−1 , Ej )]

S (ri , Ej ) −

�
i∈C

S (pi , Ej ).

Although the independence and alternating participation conditions assumed for the theorem are rather
strong, they provide a scenario under which the market
scoring rule admits arbitrage.

Conclusions

We have shown that many of the strictly proper mechanisms that have been shown to encourage forecasters to
report their true beliefs fail to do so when the forecasters are able to cooperate. When players form a coalition they always receive more by coordinating their
reports because the mechanisms admit arbitrage. We
have shown this happens with contracts for traditional
strictly proper scoring rules, including the quadratic,
logarithmic, and spherical scoring rules. We have also
shown this arbitrage for competitive mechanisms based
on strictly proper scoring rules, such as those proposed
by Hanson (2003), Kilgour and Gerchak (2004) and
Lambert et al. (2008).
We had been hoping to use these results to develop a
mechanism resistant to cooperation. It is still an open
question whether there is any strictly proper mechanism that does not admit arbitrage, but it seems unlikely. In prediction markets, it would be diﬃcult to
prevent players from cooperating, or to prevent an intermediary, such as a web portal, from exploiting the
surplus from cooperation that comes from bringing together forecasters who disagree. Such an intermediary
would be guaranteed a profit even if she had no knowledge about the uncertainty.
For a decision maker subsidizing a prediction market to
observe players’ true forecasts, these results raise questions. They suggest that coalitions obtain their surplus
from cooperation by reducing the variation among the
reports from members, falsely appearing to reach consensus. Thus, decision makers would lose valuable information about the diversity of opinion among forecasters, and might lose the benefit of their heterogeneous information sources.
Another issue with cooperation is that the surplus from
cooperation can increase the cost to the decision maker
for the contract for traditional scoring rules while distorting the information she obtains. Although there
is no increase in the cost for self-financing competitive
mechanisms, in that case the surplus comes from the
players who are not cooperating, reducing their incentive to participate.
In situations where a decision maker can identify a particular forecaster in order to weight his report based on
his reputation or other characteristics, his report can
be misleading when he is acting as a coalition member
rather than stating his true beliefs. One significant

exception, when the information is not distorted by
cooperation, is when the decision maker will use only
the weighted average of the forecasts and the scoring
rule is quadratic, encouraging coalitions to report their
weighted average forecast.
In performing our analysis of cooperating players, we
have focused on arbitrage rather than maximal expected payment. For example, if the coalition is managed by an intermediary maximizing her expected payment, she should make an identical report for all of
the coalition’s wagers using her personal forecast. We
consider it more prudent to demonstrate how she can
make a guaranteed profit without taking any risk or
possessing any expertise.
Finally, while we have examined the surplus from cooperation for a coalition, we have not discussed how coalition members should behave inside a coalition. Three
related issues are what coalition members will report
to each other, what they will report to the decision
maker, and how they will share the surplus from cooperation. We have studied this problem assuming that
players can act strategically within the coalition, seeking to maximize their expected payments in the context of the coalition’s decision process (Chun 2011).
We assume that
• players will be paid according to a quadratic scoring rule;
• coalition members report to the decision maker
the weighted average of the reports they shared
within the coalition;
• coalition members distribute the surplus from cooperation proportional to their weights; and
• each coalition member believes that the expectation of the average of the other members’ true
probabilities is the same as his own probability,

These are reasonable for players who accept the “wisdom of crowds.” Under these assumptions, because
each coalition member wants to report truthfully
within the coalition assuming that the others do so,
it is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for every coalition
member to report truthfully within the coalition.

If all members of the coalition agree about E then q =
pi for all i ∈ C. For the rest of this proof we will
assume that the members disagree about E.
We will show that there is positive surplus from cooperation and that q ∈ ∆m . First, we find an expression
