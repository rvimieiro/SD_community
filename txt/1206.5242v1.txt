Abstract
Computing the probability of evidence even with
known error bounds is NP-hard. In this paper we
address this hard problem by settling on an easier
problem. We propose an approximation which
provides high confidence lower bounds on probability of evidence but does not have any guarantees in terms of relative or absolute error. Our
proposed approximation is a randomized importance sampling scheme that uses the Markov inequality. However, a straight-forward application
of the Markov inequality may lead to poor lower
bounds. We therefore propose several heuristic
measures to improve its performance in practice.
Empirical evaluation of our scheme with stateof-the-art lower bounding schemes reveals the
promise of our approach.

Introduction

Computing the probability of evidence even with known
error bounds is NP-hard [Dagum and Luby, 1993]. In this
paper we address this hard problem by proposing an approximation that gives high confidence lower bounds on
the probability of evidence but does not have any guarantees of relative or absolute error.

Leisink and Kappen, 2003, Bidyuk and Dechter, 2006a]
and sampling based randomized approximations
[Cheng, 2001, Dagum and Luby, 1997].
An approximation algorithm for computing the lower bound is
deterministic if it always outputs an approximation that
is a lower bound. On the other hand, an approximation
algorithm is randomized if the approximation fails with
some probability δ > 0. The work in this paper falls under
the class of randomized approximations.

Randomized
approximations
[Cheng, 2001,
Dagum and Luby, 1997] use known inequalities such
as the Chebyshev and the Hoeffding inequalities
[Hoeffding, 1963] for lower (and upper) bounding
the probability of evidence. The Chebyshev and Hoeffding
inequalities provide bounds on how the sample mean
of N independently and identically distributed random
variables deviates from the actual mean. The main idea
in [Cheng, 2001, Dagum and Luby, 1997] is to express
the problem of computing the probability of evidence as
the problem of computing the mean (or expected value)
of independent random variables and then use the mean
over the sampled random variables to bound the deviation
from the actual mean. The problem with these previous
approaches is that the number of samples required to
guarantee high confidence lower (or upper) bounds is
inversely proportional to the probability of evidence (or
the actual mean). Therefore, if the probability of evidence
is arbitrarily small (e.g. < 10−20 ), a large number of
samples (approximately 1019 ) are required to guarantee
the correctness of the bounds.
We alleviate this problem, which arises from the dependence of the Hoeffding and Chebyshev inequalities on
the number of samples N, by using the Markov inequality which is independent of N. Recently, the Markov inequality was used to lower bound the number of solutions of a Satisfiability formula [Gomes et al., 2007] showing good empirical results. We adapt this scheme to compute lower bounds on probability of evidence and extend
it in several ways. First, we show how importance sampling can be used to obtain lower bounds using the Markov
inequality. Second, we address the difficulty associated
with the approach presented in [Gomes et al., 2007] in that
with the increase in number of samples the lower bound is
likely to decrease by proposing several parametric heuristic methods. Third, we show how the probability of evidence of belief networks with zero probabilities can be efficiently estimated by using the Markov inequality in conjunction with a recently proposed SampleSearch scheme
[Gogate and Dechter, 2007]. Finally, we provide empirical
results demonstrating the potential of our new scheme by

comparing against state-of-the-art bounding schemes such
as bound propagation [Leisink and Kappen, 2003] and its
improvements [Bidyuk and Dechter, 2006b].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
we discuss preliminaries and related work. In section 3, we
present our lower bounding scheme and propose various
heuristics to improve it. In section 4, we describe how the
SampleSearch scheme can be used within our lower bounding scheme. Experimental results are presented in section
5 and we end with a summary in section 6.

Preliminaries and Previous work

We represent sets by bold capital letters and members of a
set by capital letters. An assignment of a value to a variable
is denoted by a small letter while bold small letters indicate
an assignment to a set of variables.
Definition 1. (belief networks) A belief network (BN) is a
graphical model P = hZ, D, Pi, where Z = {Z1 , . . . , Zn }
is a set of random variables over multi-valued domains
D = {D1 , . . . , Dn }. Given a directed acyclic graph G over
Z, P = {Pi }, where Pi = P(Zi |pa(Zi )) are conditional probability tables (CPTs) associated with each Zi . The set
pa(Zi ) is the set of parents of the variable Zi in G. A belief network represents a probability distribution over Z,
P(Z) = ∏ni=1 P(Zi |pa(Zi )). An evidence set E = e is an instantiated subset of variables.
Definition 2 (Probability of Evidence). Given a belief network P and evidence E = e, the probability of evidence
P(E = e) is defined as:
n

P(e) =

∑ ∏ P(Z j |pa(Z j ))|E=e

(1)

Z\E j=1

To compute the probability of evidence by importance sampling, we use the substitution:
n

f (x) = P(z, e) =

∏ P(Z j |pa(Z j ))|E=e ,
j=1

X = Z\E

(4)

For the rest of the paper, assume M = P(e) and f (x) =
∏nj=1 P(Z j |pa(Z j ))|E=e .
Several choices are available for the proposal distribution Q(x) ranging from the prior distribution as in likelihood weighting to more sophisticated alternatives such as
IJGP-Sampling [Gogate and Dechter, 2005] and EPIS-BN
[Yuan and Druzdzel, 2006] where the output of belief propagation is used to compute the proposal distribution.
As in prior work [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000], we assume
that the proposal distribution is expressed in a factored
product form dictated by the belief network: Q(X) =
∏ni=1 Qi (Xi |X1 , . . . , Xi−1 ) = ∏ni=1 Qi (Xi |Yi ), where Yi ⊆
{X1 , . . . , Xi−1 }, Qi (Xi |Yi ) = Q(Xi |X1 , . . . , Xi−1 ) and |Yi | < c
for some constant c. When Q is given in a product form ,
we can generate a full sample from Q as follows. For i
= 1 to n, sample Xi = xi from the conditional distribution
Q(Xi |X1 = x1 , . . . , Xi−1 = xi−1 ) and set Xi = xi . This is often referred to as an ordered Monte Carlo sampler.

Related Work

[Dagum and Luby, 1997] provide an upper bound on the
number of samples N required to guarantee that for any
b computed using Equation 3 apε , δ > 0, the estimate M
proximates M with relative error ε with probability at least
1 − δ . Formally,
b ≤ M(1 + ε )] > 1 − δ
Pr[M(1 − ε ) ≤ M

(5)

The specific bound on N that the authors derive is:
The notation h(Z)|E=e stands for a function h over Z \ E
with the assignment E = e.
2.1

N≥

Importance sampling [Rubinstein, 1981] is a simulation
technique commonly used to evaluate the following sum:
M = ∑x∈X f (x) for some real function f . The idea is to
generate samples x1 , . . . , xN from a proposal distribution Q
(satisfying f (x) > 0 ⇒ Q(x) > 0) and then estimate M as
follows:

b= 1

In both these bounds (Equations 6 and 7) N is inversely
proportional to M and therefore when M is small, a large
number of samples are required to achieve an acceptable
confidence level (1 − δ ) > 99%.
A bound on N is required because [Dagum and Luby, 1997,
Cheng, 2001] use Chebyshev and Hoeffding inequalities
which depend on N for correctness. Instead, we could use
the Markov inequality which is independent of N and still
achieve high confidence lower bounds. The independence
from N allows us to use even a single sample to derive
lower bounds. The only caveat is that our proposed method
does not have any guarantees in terms of relative error ε .
We describe our method in the next section.

Markov Inequality to lower bound P(e)

Definition 3 (Markov Inequality). For any random variable
X and k > 1, Pr(X ≥ kE[X]) ≤ 1k
[Gomes et al., 2007] show how the Markov inequality can
be used to obtain probabilistic lower bounds on the number
of solutions of a satisfiability/constraint satisfaction problem. Using the same approach, we present a small modification of importance sampling for obtaining lower bounds
on the probability of evidence (see Algorithm 1). The algorithm generates k independent samples from a proposal
(x)
distribution Q and returns the minimum αfQ(x)
(minCount
in Algorithm 1) over the k-samples.

T HEOREM 1 (Lower Bound). With probability of at least
1 − 1/α k , Markov-LB returns a lower bound on M = P(e)
Proof. Consider an arbitrary sample xi .
It is clear
from the discussion in section 2 that the expected value
of f (xi )/Q(xi ) is equal to M.
Therefore, by the
f (xi )
Pr( α ∗Q(x
i)

Markov inequality, we have
> M) < 1/α .
Since, the generated k samples are independent, the
f (xi )
k
probability Pr(minki=1 α ∗Q(x
i ) > M) < 1/α and therefore
i

f (x )
1
Pr(minki=1 [ α ∗Q(x
i ) ] ≤ M) > 1 − α k .

The problem with Algorithm 1 is that unless the variance
of f (x)/Q(x) is very small, we expect the lower bound to
decrease with increase in the number of samples k. In practice, given a required confidence of δ = α k , one can decrease α as k is increased.
Note that each sample in Algorithm 1 provides a lower
bound with probability > (1 − 1/α ). We can replace the
sample by any procedure that provides a lower bound with
probability > (1 − 1/α ) and therefore in the following
we propose several heuristic methods to compute a lower
bound with probability > (1 − 1/α ).

Using the maximum over N samples

We can even use the maximum instead of the average over
the N i.i.d samples and still achieve a confidence of 1 −
1/α . Given a set of N independent events such that each
event occurs with probability > (1 − 1/β ), the probability
that all events occur is > (1 − 1/β )N . Consequently, we
can prove that:
Proposition 1. Given N i.i.d. samples generated from Q,
(xi )
N
Pr(maxNi=1 [ βfQ(x
i ) ] < M) > (1 − 1/β ) .
Therefore, by setting (1 − 1/β )N = 1 − 1/α (i.e. β =
1/[1 − (1 − 1/α )1/N ]) and recording the maximum value of
f (xi )/β Q(xi ) over the N samples, we can achieve a lower
bound on M with confidence (1 − 1/α ).
Again the problem with this method is that increasing the
number of samples increases β and consequently the lower
bound decreases. However, when the variance of the random variables f (xi )/Q(xi ) is large, the maximum value is
likely to be larger than the sample average. Another approach to utilize the maximum over the N samples is to use
the martingale inequalities.
3.3

Using the martingale Inequalities

In this subsection, we show how the martingale theory can
be used to obtain lower bounds on P(e).
Definition 4 (Martingale). A sequence of random variables
X1 , . . . , XN is a martingale with respect to another sequence
Z1 , . . . , ZN defined on a common probability space Ω iff
E[Xi |Z1 , . . . , Zi−1 ] = Xi−1 for all i.
Given i.i.d. samples (x1 , . . . , xN ) generated from Q, note

E[Λ p
= Λ p−1 as required. The expected
value E[Λ1 ] = 1 and for such martingales which have
a mean of 1, [Breiman, 1968] provides the following
extension of the Markov inequality:

is likely to increase the minimum value over the k iterations

In the following example, we show how constraints can be
extracted from the CPTs.

Overcoming Rejection: Using
SampleSearch with Markov-LB

One problem with importance sampling based algorithms
is the so-called rejection problem and in this section
we discuss how to alleviate this problem in MarkovLB by using the recently proposed SampleSearch scheme
[Gogate and Dechter, 2007].
4.1

The rejection problem has been largely ignored in the importance sampling community except the work on adaptive
importance sampling techniques [Hernández et al., 1998,
Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000, Yuan and Druzdzel, 2006]. In
[Gogate and Dechter, 2005], we initiated a new approach
of reducing the amount of rejection by using constraint processing methods. The main idea is to express the zero probabilities in the belief network using constraints.
Definition 5 (constraint network). A constraint network
(CN) is defined by a 3-tuple, R = hZ, D, Ci, where Z is
a set of variables Z = {Z1 , . . . , Zn }, associated with a set
of discrete-valued domains, D = {D1 , . . . , Dn }, and a set of
constraints C = {C1 , . . . ,Cr }. Each constraint Ci is a relation RSi defined on a subset of variables Si ⊆ Z. The
relation denotes all compatible tuples of the cartesian product of the domains of Si . A solution is an assignment of
values to all variables z = (Z1 = z1 , . . . , Zn = zn ), zi ∈ Di ,
such that z belongs to the natural join of all constraints i.e.
z ∈ RS1 ⊲⊳ . . . ⊲⊳ RSr . The constraint satisfaction problem
(CSP) is to determine if a constraint network has a solution,
and if so, to find one. When we write R(z), we mean that
z satisfies all the constraints in R.

Rejection Problem

Given a positive belief network that expresses the probability distribution P(Z) = ∏ni=1 P(Zi |Z1 , . . . , Zi−1 ) and an
empty evidence set, all full samples generated by the ordered Monte Carlo sampler along the ordering Z1 , . . . , Zn
are guaranteed to have a non-zero weight. However, in
presence of both zero probabilities and evidence the ordered Monte Carlo sampler may generate samples which
have zero weight because the sample may conflict with the
evidence and zero probabilities. Formally, if the proposal
distribution Q is such that the probability of sampling an assignment from the set {x| f (x) = 0} is substantially larger
than the probability of sampling an assignment from the set
{x| f (x) > 0}, a large number of samples generated from Q
will have zero weight. In fact, in the extreme case if no
positive weight samples are generated, the lower bound reported by the Markov-LB scheme will be trivially zero.

Figure 1: An example Belief Network.
Example 1. Figure 1 presents a belief network over 6
binary variables. The CPTs associated with C and G
have zero probabilities. The constraint extracted from
the CPT of C is the relation RA,C = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)}
while the CPT of G yields the constraint relation RD,F,G =
{(0, 0, 0)(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0)}. Namely, each ”0” tuple in a CPT corresponds to a no-good, and therefore does
not appear in the corresponding relation.
Our importance sampling scheme called IJGP-Sampling
[Gogate and Dechter, 2005] uses constraint propagation to
reduce rejection. Given a partial sample (x1 , . . . , x p ), constraint propagation prunes values in the domains of future variables Xp+1 , . . . , Xn which are inconsistent with
(x1 , . . . , x p ).
However, we observed recently that when a substantial number of zero probabilities are present or when

GOGATE ET AL.
there are many evidence variables, the level of constraint
propagation achieved by IJGP is not effective and often
few/no consistent samples will be generated. Therefore in
[Gogate and Dechter, 2007], we proposed a more aggressive approach that searches explicitly for a non-zero weight
sample yielding the SampleSearch scheme.

4.2

The SampleSearch scheme

An ordered Monte Carlo sampler samples variables in the
order hX1 , . . . , Xn i from the proposal distribution Q and rejects a partial or full sample (x1 , . . . , xi ) if it violates any
constraints in R (R models zero probabilities in f ). Upon
rejecting a (partial or full) sample, the sampler starts sampling anew from the first variable in the ordering. Instead, we propose the following modification. We can set
Qi (Xi = xi |x1 , . . . , xi−1 ) = 0 (to reflect that (x1 , . . . , xi ) is not
consistent), normalize Qi and re-sample Xi from the normalized distribution. The newly sampled value may be
consistent in which case we can proceed to variable Xi+1
or it may be inconsistent. If we repeat the process we
may reach a point where Qi (Xi |x1 , . . . , xi−1 ) is 0 for all values of Xi . In this case, (x1 , . . . , xi−1 ) is inconsistent and
therefore we need to change the distribution at Xi−1 by setting Qi−1 (Xi−1 = xi−1 |x1 , . . . , xi−2 ) = 0, normalize and resample Xi−1 . We can repeat this process until a globally
consistent full sample that satisfies all constraints in R is
generated. By construction, this process always yields a
globally consistent full sample.
Our proposed SampleSearch scheme is described as Algorithm 2. It is a depth first backtracking search (DFS) over
the state space of consistent partial assignments searching
for a solution to a constraint satisfaction problem R, whose
value selection is guided by Q.

145

It can be proved that SampleSearch generates independently and identically distributed samples from the
backtrack-free distribution which we define below.
Definition 6 (Backtrack-free distribution ). Given a distribution Q(X) = ∏Ni=1 Qi (Xi |X1 , . . . , Xi−1 ), an ordering O =
hx1 , . . . , xn i and a set of constraints R, the backtrack-free
distribution QR is the distribution:
n

QR (x) = ∏ QRi (xi |x1 , . . ., xi−1 )

(11)

i=1

where QRi (xi |x1 , . . . , xi−1 ) is given by:
QRi (xi |x1 , . . ., xi−1 ) =

Qi (xi |x1 , . . ., xi−1 )
1 − ∑x′i ∈Bi Qi (x′i |x1 , . . ., xi−1 )

(12)

where Bi = {x′i ∈ Di |(x1 , . . . , xi−1 , x′i ) can not be extended
to a solution of R} and xi ∈
/ Bi . Note that by definition,
f (x) = 0 ⇒ QR (x) = 0 and vice versa.

T HEOREM 2. [Gogate and Dechter, 2007] SampleSearch
generates independently and identically distributed samples from the backtrack-free distribution.
Given that the backtrack-free distribution is the sampling
distribution of SampleSearch, we can use SampleSearch
within the importance sampling framework as follows. Let
(x1 , . . . , xN ) be a set of i.i.d samples generated by SampleSearch. Then we can estimate M = ∑x∈X f (x) as:
N
i
b = 1 ∑ f (x )
M
N i=1 QR (xi )

(13)

Although SampleSearch was described using the naive
backtracking algorithm, in principle we can integrate any
systematic CSP/SAT solver that employs advanced search
schemes with sampling through our SampleSearch scheme.
Since the current implementations of SAT solvers are very
efficient, we represent the zero probabilities in the belief network using cnf (SAT) expressions and use Minisat
[Sorensson and Een, 2005] as our SAT solver.
Computing QR (x) given a sample x:
From Definition 6, we notice that to compute the components QRi (xi |x1 , . . . , xi−1 ) for a sample x = (x1 , . . . , xn ), we
have to determine the set Bi = {x′i ∈ Di |(x1 , . . . , xi−1 , x′i ) can
not be extended to a solution of R}. The set Bi can be
determined by checking for each x′i ∈ Di if the partial assignment (x1 , . . . , xi−1 , x′i ) can be extended to a solution of
R. To speed up this checking at each branch point, we use
the Minisat SAT solver [Sorensson and Een, 2005]. Minisat should be invoked a maximum of O(n ∗ (d − 1)) times
where n is the number of variables and d is the maximum
domain size.
In [Gogate and Dechter, 2007], we found that the SampleSearch based importance sampling scheme outperforms all
competing approaches when a substantial number of zero

146

probabilities are present in the belief network. Therefore,
we employ SampleSearch as a sampling technique within
Markov-LB when a substantial number of zero probabilities are present. It should be obvious that when Samplei
Search is used, we should use QfR(x(x)i ) as a random variable
instead of

Markov-LB with SampleSearch and IJGP-sampling:
The performance of importance sampling based algorithms is highly dependent on the proposal distribution
[Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000, Yuan and Druzdzel, 2006]. It
was shown that computing the proposal distribution from
the output of a Generalized Belief Propagation scheme
of Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) yields better empirical performance than other available choices
[Gogate and Dechter, 2005]. Therefore, we use the output
of IJGP to compute the proposal distribution Q. The complexity of IJGP is time and space exponential in its i-bound,
a parameter that bounds cluster sizes. We use a i-bound of 3
in all our experiments. The preprocessing time for computing the proposal distribution using IJGP (i = 3) was negligible (< 2 seconds for the hardest instances).
We experimented with four versions of Markov-LB (a)
Markov-LB as given in Algorithm 1, (b) Markov-LB with
the average heuristic, (c) Markov-LB with the martingale
random permutation heuristic and (d) Markov-LB with the
martingale order statistics heuristic. In all our experiments,
we set α = 2 and k = 7 which gives us a correctness confidence of 1 − 1/27 ≈ 99.2% on our lower bounds. Finally,
we set N = 100 for the heuristic methods. Also note that
when the belief network is positive we use IJGP-sampling
but when the belief network has zero probabilities, we use
SampleSearch whose initial proposal distribution Q is computed from the output of IJGP.
Bound Propagation with Cut-set Conditioning We also
experimented with the state of the art any-time bounding
scheme that combines sampling-based cut-set conditioning
and bound propagation [Leisink and Kappen, 2003] and
which is a part of Any-Time Bounds framework for bounding posterior marginals [Bidyuk and Dechter, 2006a].
Given a subset of variables C ⊂ X\E, we can compute
P(e) exactly as follows:
k

P(e) = ∑ P(ci , e)

(14)

i=1

The lower bound on P(e) is obtained by computing
P(ci , e) for h high probability tuples of C (selected
through sampling) and bounding the remaining probability mass by computing a lower bound PL (c1 , ..., cq , e) on

L (z |z , ..., z
where lower bound PBP
i 1
i−1 ) is computed
directly by bound propagation.
We use here the
same variant of bound propagation described in
[Bidyuk and Dechter, 2006b] that is used by the AnyTime Bounds framework. The lower bound obtained by
Eq. 15 can be improved by exploring a larger number of
tuples h. After generating h tuples by sampling, we can
stop the computation at any time after bounding p < k′ out
of k′ partially instantiated tuples and produce the result.

In our experiments we run the bound propagation with cutset conditioning scheme until convergence or until a stipulated time bound has expired. Finally, we should note that
the bound propagation with cut-set conditioning scheme
provides deterministic lower and upper bounds on P(e)
while our Markov-LB scheme provides only a lower bound
and it may fail with a probability δ ≤ 0.01.
5.1.1 Evaluation Criteria
We experimented with six sets of benchmark belief networks (a) Alarm networks (b) CPCS networks, (c) Randomly generated belief networks, (d) Linkage networks,
(e) Grid networks and (f) Two-layered deterministic networks. Note that only linkage, grid and deterministic networks have zero probabilities.
On each network instance, we compare log relative error
between the exact probability of evidence and the lower
bound reported by the competing techniques. Formally, if
Pexact is the actual probability of evidence and Papp is the
approximate probability of evidence, we compute the logrelative error as follows:
∆ = Abs(

log(Pexact ) − log(Papp )
)
log(Pexact )

(17)

Note that the exact P(e) for most instances is available from
the UAI competition web-site 1 . The exact P(e) for the
two layered deterministic networks was computed using
AND/OR search [Dechter and Mateescu, 2004].
We compute the log relative error instead of the usual relative error because when the probability of evidence is

extremely small the relative error between the exact and
the approximate probability of evidence will be arbitrarily
close to 1 and we would need a large number of digits to
determine the best performing competing scheme.

Results

Our results are summarized in Table 1. We see that our
new strategy of Markov-LB scales well with problem size
and provides good quality high-confidence lower bounds

147

on most problems. It clearly outperforms the bound propagation with cut-set conditioning scheme. We discuss the
results in detail below.
The Alarm networks The Alarm networks are one of the
earliest belief networks designed by medical experts for
monitoring patients in intensive care. The evidence in these
networks was set at random. These networks have between 100-125 binary nodes. We can see that Markov-LB
is slightly superior to the bound propagation based scheme
accuracy-wise, but is far more efficient time-wise. Among
the different versions of Markov-LB, the average heuristic
performs better than the martingale heuristics. The minimum heuristic is the worst performing heuristic.
The CPCS networks The CPCS networks are derived
from the Computer-based Patient Case Simulation system
[Pradhan et al., 1994]. The nodes of CPCS networks correspond to diseases and findings and conditional probabilities
describe their correlations. The CPCS360b and CPCS422b
networks have 360 and 422 variables respectively. We report results on the two networks with 20,30,40 and 50 randomly selected evidence nodes. We see that the lower
bounds reported by the bound propagation based scheme
are slightly better than Markov-LB on the CPCS360b networks but they take far more time. However, on the
CPCS422b networks, Markov-LB has better performance
than the bound propagation based scheme. The martingale
heuristics (the random permutation and the order statistics)
have better performance than the average heuristic. Again,
the minimum heuristic has the worst performance. Note
that we stop each algorithm after 2 mins of run-time if the
algorithm has not terminated by itself.
Random networks The random networks are randomly
generated graphs available from the UAI competition website. The evidence nodes are generated at random. The
networks have between 53 and 76 nodes and the maximum
domain size is 50. We see that Markov-LB is better than the
bound propagation based scheme on all random networks.
The random permutation and the ordered statistics martingale heuristics are slightly better than the average heuristic
on most instances.
Grid Networks The Grid instances are also available from
the UAI competition web-site. All nodes in the Grid are
binary and evidence nodes are selected at random. The
Grid networks have substantial amount of determinism and
therefore we employ the SampleSearch based importance
sampling scheme to compute the lower bound. Here, we
stop each algorithm after 10 minutes if it has not terminated by itself. We notice that the performance of MarkovLB is significantly better than the bound propagation based
scheme on all instances.
Linkage networks The linkage instances are generated by converting a Pedigree to a Bayesian network
[Fishelson and Geiger, 2003]. These networks have be-

tween 777-2315 nodes with a maximum domain size of
36 and are much larger than the Alarm, the CPCS, and
the random networks. On these networks, we ran each
algorithm until termination or until a time-bound of 1hr
expired. The Linkage instances have a large number of
zero probabilities which makes them hard for traditional
importance sampling based schemes because of the rejection problem. Therefore, in all our experiments on linkage instances we used the SampleSearch based importance
sampling scheme. On Linkage instances, IJGP-sampling
did not return a single non-zero weight sample (not shown
in Table 1) in more than one-hour of run-time yielding a
lower bound of 0. We see that the bound propagation based
scheme yields inferior lower bounds as compared to the
SampleSearch based Markov-LB scheme. However, we
notice that the log-relative-error is significantly higher for
Markov-LB on the linkage instances than the Alarm, the
CPCS, and the random instances. We suspect that this is
because the quality of the proposal distribution computed
from the output of IJGP is not as good on the linkage instances as compared to other instances. Finally, we notice
that the average and the martingale-heuristics perform better than the min heuristic on all instances with the martingale order statistics heuristic being the best performing
heuristic.

using the SampleSearch scheme. Our experimental results
on a range of benchmarks show that our new lower bounding scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art bound propagation scheme and provides high confidence good quality
lower bounds on most instances.

Deterministic two-layered networks Our final domain
is that of completely deterministic two-layered networks.
Here, the first layer is a set of root nodes connected to a second layer of leaf nodes. The CPTs of the root node are such
that each value in the domain is equally likely while the
CPTs associated with the leaf nodes are deterministic i.e.
each CPT entry is either one or a zero. All nodes are binary.
The evidence set is all the leaf nodes instantiated to a value.
We experimented with 5 randomly generated 1000-variable
two-layered networks each with 800 leaf nodes which are
set to true (evidence). We employ the SampleSearch based
importance sampling scheme for these networks because
these instances have zero probabilities. We see that the average and the martingale heuristics are the best performing heuristics while the min-heuristic performs the worst.
The SampleSearch based Markov-LB scheme shows significantly better performance than the bound propagation
based scheme.

Conclusion and Summary

In this paper, we proposed a randomized approximation algorithm, Markov-LB for computing high confidence lower
bounds on probability of evidence. Markov-LB is based on
importance sampling and the Markov inequality. A straight
forward application of the Markov inequality may lead to
poor lower bounds and therefore we suggest various heuristic measures to improve Markov-LB’s performance. We
also show how the performance of Markov-LB can be improved further on belief networks with zero probabilities by
