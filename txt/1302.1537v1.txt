Abstract

This paper proposes a method that finds a
preference relation on a set of acts from the
knowledge of an ordering on events describing
the decision-maker's uncertainty and an ordering
of consequences of acts, describing the decision
maker's preferences. However, contrary to
classical approaches to decision theory, this
method does not resort to any numerical
representation of utility nor uncertainty and is
purely ordinal. It is shown that although many
axioms of Savage theory can be preserved and
despite the intuitive appeal of the ordinal method,
the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic
representation of uncertainty. It leads to the kind
of uncertainty theory encountered in non­
monotonic reasoning (especially preferential and
rational inference). Moreover the method turns
out to be either very little decisive or to lead to
very risky decisions, although its basic principles
look sound. This paper raises the question of the
very possibility of purely symbolic approaches
to Savage-like decision-making under uncertainty
and obtains preliminary negative results.

INTRODUCTION

In Savage decision theory (Savage, 1972), a decision
problem is cast in the framework of a set of states (of the
world) and a set of consequences. An act is viewed as a
mapping f from the finite state space S to the consequence
set X, namely in each state s the result of f is f(s ) e X.
Savage is interested in the following problem: Starting
from a user-driven preference relation over acts, i.e., (XS,
;::), and axioms that such a preference relation should obey
if the decision-maker is "rational", construct a relation
representing uncertainty on the subsets of S, and a
preference relation on the consequences. If (XS, ;::)
satisfies suitable properties then the uncertainty on S can
be represented by a probability distribution p, the

preference relation on X by a utility function u, and the
preference relation on acts by expected utility:
f;:: g <=> Lse S p(s )u(f( s)) ;:: Lse s p(s)u(g(s)).
In this research, we are first interested in the converse
problem, namely: if an uncertainty relation on events in
2S is given, and a preference relation on consequences is
given as well, how can a preference relation on acts be
recovered with a purely symbolic approach? This problem
is realistic because a decision maker is not necessarily
capable of describing his state of uncertainty by means of
a probability distribution, nor may he be able to quantify
his preferences on X. A natural technique that solves this
problem is described. Applying this technique to a
comparative probability relation on events we get a non­
transitive relation on acts. However this anomaly is
avoided if we assume a possibility ordering on events.
A characterization of this kind of approach is obtained by
preserving the basic axioms of Savage augmented with an
axiom sanctioning the proposed ordinal act-ordering
technique, but without assuming transitivity of
indifference between acts. However as shown here, the
uncertainty relation obtained in this general setting is
closely related to preferential inference in nonmonotonic
reasoning and the decision guidelines obtained in this
setting are questionable.

FROM UNCERTAINTY AND
PREFERENCE RELATIONS TO AN
ORDERING OF ACTS

This section introduces a natural technique to compute a
preference relation on acts from a purely symbolic
perspective. Let (2S, ;::u) be an uncertainty relation on
events. We assume that ;::U is a complete partial ordering,
non-trivial (S >u 0), and faithful to deductive inference:
A!;;;B
;; => A:S:u B.
As usual, let us define the indifference � u and the strict
relation < u induced from ;::U by:
A �u B iff A :S:u B and B :S:u A
A < u B iff A :5::u B and not (B :S:u A).

Dubois, Fargier, and Prade

The preference on X is just a complete partial ordering �p.
It is assumed that X has at least two elements x and y s.t.
X >p y.
If no commensurability assumption can be made, a natural
way of lifting (�u. :$;p) on xs is to assume that an act f is
at least as promising as an act g iff the event [f ;?: g ]
formed by the disjunction of states in which f gives
results at least as good as g, is at least as likely as the
event [g <:: f], formed by the disjunction of states in which
g gives results at least as good as f. A state s is as a more
promising state for f than for g iff f(s) <::p g(s). Hence, we
construct the preference between acts and the corres­
ponding indifference and strict preference relations as:

Definition (L).
f<::g iff [f<::g] <::u [g<::f] where [f<:: g] = { s, f(s) <::p g(s)};
f - g iff f<:: g and g:$;f;
f>g iff f;?:g and not(g�f).
This approach seems to be very natural, and is the first
one that comes to mind when information is only
available under the form of an uncertainty relation on
events and a preference relation on consequences, if the
preference and uncertainty scales are not commensurate.

The properties of the relations <::, -, and > on x s will
depend on the properties of ;?:u. The most obvious choice
for <::u is a qualitative probability (e.g., Fishburn, 1986)

Definition. <::u is a qualitative probability iff
i)
;?:u is complete and transitive
ii) S>u 0. v A :<!u 0
iii) A<::0, A11(BuC)=0 ==> (B;?:uC<=>Au B<::u AuC).
A first negative result is that if <::u is a qualitative
probability ordering then relation > in x s is not
necessarily transitive. So the ordinal approach embodied in
definition (L) cannot agree with Savage decision theory.

It is easy to verify that :
P([f<::g])=P( { s 1 ,s2,s4} )=5/9 >P([g<::f ])=P( { s3,s5,s6})=4/9
P((g;?: h])=P( { s1 ,s3,s6 })=5/9 > P([h<::g])=P( { s2,s4,s5})=4/9
P([f<::h])=P( { s1 ,s2,s3})=4/9 >P([h<::f])=P( { s4,s5,s6} )=5/9.
Hence f>g>h but h>f. Note that the intransitivity result
does not depend on the figures in the table insofar as the
sign of the utility values is respected. This situation can
be viewed as an analog of the Condorcet paradox in social
choice, here in the setting of decision under uncertainty.
Thinking about an alternative approach, the simplest type
of qualitative uncertainty ordering are those induced by
necessity measures (Dubois, 1986):

Definition. <::N is a qualitative necessity ordering iff
i) <::N is complete and transitive
ii) S >N 0, V A <:: N 0
iii) B �N C ==> A 11 B ;?:N A 11 C.
They are also epistemic entrenchments in the sense of
Gii.rdenfors (Dubois and Prade, 1991 ), and comparative
possibility orderings of Lewis (1973). From now on, we
assume that :<!u
�N. Any necessity ordering can be
:::;

represented by a necessity function on an ordinal scale:

Property (Dubois, 1986). 3N such that: B �N C <=>
N(B) ;;:: N(C) where N(F) e [ 0, I] and N(F 11 G) :::;
min(N(F), N(G)) whatever F and G.
Necessity orderings are simple since that they can be
derived from a complete partial ordering on states only,
and can be encoded as a possibility distribution. We can
now write in accordance with definition (L):
f<::g <=> N([t;?:g]) ;?: N([g�f]).

In terms of possibility measures (Zadeh, 1978), I1(A) =
I

N( A), then:

PROPERTIES OF THE
POSSIBILITY -DRIVEN RELATION
ON ACTS

In accordance with Savage, we use the following
definitions:

Definitions.
• f1A u g1 A. is the act s.t. (fi A u g1 A.) (s) = f(s) if seA ,
= g(s) otherwise.
A u h1A.
• f<:: A g iff'v'h f1A u h i A<:: g i
• A null iff V'f,g , f :<!A g
• V'x,y e X, x�y iff fx�fy where fx: V'se S fx(s)=x and
fy: Vse S fy(s):::;y
f1A u g1 A is like a lottery whose result is state dependent.
f �A g denotes the notion of conditional preference over
acts. A null event is a set of states in which the result of
acts does not matter. The reason for this indifference is
that the agent considers that this act will never happen.
The last point identifies constant acts fx to their (unique,
state-free) consequence, so that X � x s . In case of
necessity measures on S, the following properties of (XS,
�) can be established, where<:: is defined by (1):

Proof (sketch). Let us denote B = [fiA u h1 A. ;:::: giA u

•

Proofs. the only difficulty is to prove that > is
transitive. Let f,g,h be three acts s.t. f>g, g>h, h;:::f: , i.e.
Il([f < g]) < Il([f>g])
II( [g < h]) < Il(g>h))
Il([f < h ]);:::: Il([f>h]). (i)
Let us partition S in 13 subsets:
A ={s/f(s)=g(s)=h(s)}
C = {s/f(s)=g(s) >h(s)}
E = { s/f(s)=h(s)>g(s)}
G = {s/g(s)=h(s)>f(s)}
I= {s/f(s)<h(s )<g(s)}
K = { s/h(s)<f(s)<g(s)}
M = {s/h(s)< g(s) < f(s)}.

Property P2. The preference relation ;:::: obeys the sure
thing principle:
Vf,g, h, h' f1A u hi A;:::: giA u h 1 A.
<=> f 1A U h'1A.;:::: g1A U h' I A
Sketch of proof. This is because [fiA u h 1 A ;:::: giA u

Hence: N(B);:::: N(C) <=> f ;:::A g .

B ={ s/f(s)=g(s)<h(s)}

D={s/f(s)=h(s)<g(s)}
F = {s/g(s)=h(s)<f(s)}
H = {s/f(s)<g(s)<h(s)}
J = { s/g(s)<f(s)<h(s)}
L={s g(s)<h{s)<f(s)}

The system of inequations (i) can be rewritten as:
(ii-1)
(ii-2)
(ii-3)

max(e,f,j,l,m)>max(d,g,h,i, k)
max(c,d,i,k,m)>max(b,e,h,j,l)
max(b,g,h,i,j) ;:::: max(c,f,k,l,m)

(where a is the possibility degree of A, etc.). It is
inconsistent. Indeed, from ii-1 and ii-2, one must have
max(f,c,m) greater than all of b,d,e,g,h,i,j,k,l, and this is
o
in contradiction with ii-3.
Postulate PI of Savage states that the weak preference ;::::
on acts should be a complete and transitive relation. So
the only difference between P'1 and Savage's P1 is the
lack of transitivity of the indifference relation. This lack
of transitivity can be observed in very simple cases, where
only 3 states and 2 consequences are defined. Our
formalism also differs from Lehmann's (1996) who
assumes that ;:::: is not complete but the indifference is
transitive. Non-transitive indifference is natural if f
f
means closeness. But our fonnalism satisfies some of his
axioms, in particular :

This easily checked property, which sounds like an
unanimity principle, is usually deduced from Savage's
axiomatic decision theory (however, using the transitivity
of;:::): .

The sure thing principle is the cornerstone of Savage
decision theory, and it is instrumental in getting a
probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The fact that it
is compatible here with a possibilistic representation is
due to the fact that indifference between acts is not
transitive.

[w(C)x.y;::::w(B)X·Y] =CuD does not depend on (x,y)

Thus: ro(A) x.y;::::ro(B)x.y <=> N(Au B);:::: N(A u B)
<=> ro(A)x',y';:::: W(B)x',y'

This property which is exactly Savage Postulate P4
enables events A and B to be consistently compared by
fixing x>y arbitrarily when selecting w (A)X,y and
ro(B)X·Y. It operates a restriction from xS to 2S.

So, although different from �N, the relation � obtained

elements x and y s.t. x>y) will be trivially satisfied in any
non-trivial decision theory.

THE POSSIBILISTIC LIKELIHOOD
RELATION

The relation ;::: on 2S is closely related to the necessity and
possibility orderings induced by N (and its dual IT); more
specifically it is a refinement of both orderings:
Properties.

•

N(A) >N (B) � A>B
IT(A) >IT (B)� A>B.

But it may happen that N(A ) = N(B) and A>B or that
I1(A) = IT(B) and A>B . Notice that
on 2s is not
transitive since:
�

IT<A n �) = ITc� n B) *
O<A n
IT(B n C ) = IT(B n C)

c) = m"A n C).

In fact, the indifference
on 2 s is trans1t1ve when
considering only IT-mutually exclusive events: ITCA r1 B)
= min(IT(A),IT(B)) means that A and B are not IT­
mutually exclusive according to IT, and conversely A and
B are said to be II -mutually exclusive if IT(A r1 B) -:t
�

However, since the indifference relation between events is
not transitive, this relation cannot be represented by a
probability. Because the relation on events is closely
related to necessity and possibility orderings, we shall call
it possibilistic likehood.
LINK WITH NONMONOTONIC
REASONING

To summarize, the possibilistic likelihood relation
obtained in Section 3 is a qualitative probability ordering,
but for the transitivity of indifference. The derived
possibilistic Iikehood relation ;::: also verifies properties
that are NOT satisfied by qualitative probabilities:
Properties.
• A r1 (B u C) = 0 and A� and A :2:C � A � B u C
A r1 (B u C) = 0 and A>B and A>C � A>B u C
if A, B, C are pairwise disjoint then A u B > C and
A u C > B imply A > B u C.

•

•

The latter property is closely related to one of the
characteristic properties for uncertainty functions that
represent acceptance (Dubois and Prade, 1995b; Friedman
and Halpern, 1996), i.e., a function inducing orderings for
which for any not empty set A, the set {B, A nB >

A n B} (the set of propositions accepted by > when A is
true) is deductively closed. A nonmonotonic consequence
relation can be derived from such acceptance orderings as :
AfvB<=:>A n B > A n B.

The comparative possibility ordering IT(A) > Il(B) can
also be related to nonmonotonic inference A fv B which

IlCA rl B)).

expresses that IT(AnB) > IT(An B) for a possibility
measure IT. Possibility theory is closely related to
preferential inference in nonmonotonic reasoning, as
defined by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (1990). The
properties of preferential inference are

Property. Il(A)�IT(B) <=> A:2:B iff A and B are IT­

RR

min(IT(A),IT(B)) that is if IT CA n B)< min(il(A n B),

mutually exclusive.

In other terms, :2: refines :2:N and the dual possibilistic
ordering �Il for not IT-mutually exclusive events.
The partial ordering > on events is a special case of the
so-called "discrimax" relation between vectors (Dubois et
al., 1996; Fargier et al., 1993):
A>B <=>max ie 2) (A,B)llj;::: maxie 2) (A,B)b i

where llj = 0( { Sj}) if Sj e A and .0 (A,B) = { i, aj 'i' b j}.
Finally, since ;::: on x s satisfies Savage's sure thing
principle, we have the additivity condition (iii) of
qualitative probabilities and the autoduality property:
A::::B

FROM AXIOMS ON PREFERENCE
OVER ACTS TO A THEORY OF
UNCERTAINTY

Since the five first ofSavage axioms have been retrieved
(up to the transitivity of indifference) in the previous
investigation, it is in terest in g to start the other way
round, namely given a preference relation <:: on acts, that
satisfies the above Savage-like properties, determine the
relation on events induced by 2: using Savage's P4 and the
relation on consequences using Savage's P3 that enable
the original relation 2: on acts to be recovered using the
lifting procedure (L). Doing so, the approach is much
more general: the assumption that uncertainty is
represented by possibility measures is no longer necessary
since as in the tradition of decision theory, the uncertainty
representation now comes from the properties of the
preference over acts only.
Let xs

be a set of acts equipped with a preference relation
2: such that
• P'1: (XS,<::) is complete: d t2d2 or d2<::d 1 for all pairs of
acts,
(XS ,>) is a transitive, irreflexive, partially ordered
set,
(XS ,-)defines a symmetrical and reflexive relation.
• P2: (XS,2:) satisfies the sure thing principle.
(XS,<::) satisfies Savage's axiom of compatibility
• P3:
with constant acts.
• P4 : (XS ,2:) satisfies Savage's P4 axiom about 2consequence acts.
P5':
3 x, y, z three constant acts such that x>y>z.
•

NB: Note that Savage's P5 has been strengthened to 3
consequence sets and P' l reflects the lack of transitivity of
indifference. Other postulates ofSavage are more technical

The properties (6.1- 6.6) indicate the close links between
the uncertainty theory generated and qualitative
probability; (6.7) and (6.8) show the importance of non­
null events. (6.9), (6. 10), (6.11) show that the strict
ordering of events does not propagate totally via inclusion
of sets, nor via indifferent events.
6. l CONSEQUENCES OF THE LIFTING
AXIOM

Let us now add the lifting Axiom to our set of axioms
characterising the preference on acts :
L:

f<::g � [f<::g ] 2: [g2:f].

Clearly this assumption is very strong since it prescribes
a particular behavior for the decision-maker. Under these
conditions we can show that:
Properties.
• 'rl seS, {s }>0::::? 'v'A s.t. s e A, A>0 (Pr. 6.12)
•A-0=?'v'seA{s}-0
(Pr.6.13)
• If at least two different states of S are not null, the
preference on X is a complete preorder (but the ordering
of states inS may be partial) (6. 14).
Proof of 6.14. By ( PI'), we know that 2: is complete
and > transitive. We now have to show that the
indifference relation -that one can define from <:: is also
transitive on constant acts.

Suppose that x,y, and z are three elements of
fy, fy - fz and fx>fz.

At least two states of S are not null states. Let SJ and s2
be two of the not null states and compare the decisions g,
h, k:

{ s 1 } >0,applying auto-duality and the lifting axiom leads
to obtain: g>h . Similarly, [h:?:k]=S and [k:?:h]=S-{ s2}.
Since {sz}>0, we get h>k. Similarly, [g:?:k] = S and
[k:?:g] = S. Hence g - k.
Hence, assuming fx - fy, fy - fz and fx>fz leads to get:
g>h, h>k, g-k, which is in contradiction with the

transitivity of >. Hence, - is transitive on X.

So, some properties of preferential inference (system P)
are recovered.

6. 2 GETTING SYSTEM P
At this point of our axiomatisation, we cannot get all the
properties of system P, but only some of them. In order
to prove RW, CUT and CM, we need the property:

BnC=0 and A t;;;; B and A2:C ::::::> B2:C

Proof (6.15). Let us suppose that A>B, A>C. From

P5', there are three constant acts fx, fy and fz such as

fx>fy>fz. Let us compare acts g,h,k:

which cannot be derived from our set of axioms, except if
there are no null events (pr. 6.10 and 6.11). Null events
generally never appear in nonmonotonic reasoning nor
belief revision theories. But supposing that there is no
null event is not appropriate in the context of a Savage­
like theory of decision. We prefer to add the unanimity
axiom U proposed by Lehmann (1996):

From P3: [g2:h] = B and [h2:g] = A. Since A>B, the
lifting axiom and the autoduality property lead to: g>h (i)

P4, P'5, L, U), then

From P3: [g:?:k] = S- (BuC) and [k:?:g] =A.

BnC=0 andA� Band A:?:C ::::::> B:?:C

Hence, (i), (ii) and the transitivity of > lead to: g>k, i.e.,

S- (BuC) >A. Thus, applying the autoduality property:
A > BuC.
Property 6.16 can be proved in the same way.

Hence, the type of relation we obtain on S satisfies some
of the characteristic properties of acceptance relations (cf.
Section 5). B ut it is not limited to these acceptance
relations (which are preorders on events).

Define now an inference relation as follows:

A tv B iff A n B > A n B
where > is the relation defined by our axiomatic and
projected on 2S from xs.

GETTING THE POSSIBILISTIC
LIKEHOOD RELATION

So, starting from a general framework on acts, that
respects Savage approach to a large extent, and adding a
particular decision rule that tolerates a qualitative
representation of uncertainty and preference we find a
representation of uncertainty which is representable by a
family of possibility measures, since the preferential
entailment of system P can be always represented in terms
of such a family (Dubois et al. 1995a). Notice in
particular that the order of states obtained from our
axiomatics is not necessarily a preorder, so that it cannot
be represented by a single possibility ordering. The
possibilistic likehood relation of Sections 3 and 4, based
on a preorder on states and a necessity measure is
recovered exactly if a counterpart of rational monotony is
added to the above set of postulates. Indeed, adding the
RM axiom forces the relation induced from the preference
on acts to be a complete preordering, thus corresponding
to a single possibilistic ordering as proved in (Benfehrat
et. al 1992), adding rational monotony to system P. The
possibilistic likehood relation in actually a refinement of
this possibilic ordering for not TI-mutually exclusive
events.
Theorem. The set of axioms (P' I, P2, P3, P4, P'S, L,
RM, U ) is consistent.
Proof. Since the order

on acts described in Section 3 and
4 satisfies all these axioms.

Theorem: If (�. xs ) satisfies (P'1, P2, P3 , P4, PS'),

the lifting axiom L, axioms U and RM, then there is a
preorder �1t on S and a preorder q on X such as:
�g ¢:) [f �p g] �N [g �p f]
where N is the necessity ordering over events obtained
from �1t over states

Sketch of proof. A consequence of the lifting axiom
(Pr. 6.14) we know that the projection of (�, xs) on X is
a preorder. Let us denote �p this preorder: [f �p g] = [f �
g]. From RM we also know that the projection (�. xs )
on S defines a preorder on states. Let us denote �1t this

CONCLUSION

This result is rather negative for decision theory when
only ordinal information about uncertainty and preference
on consequences is available and no commensurability
assumption is assumed between uncertainty and prefer­
ence. Despite the presence of well-knownSavage axioms,
including the sure thing principle, the admissible
uncertainty functions do not contain any kind of prob­
ability functions. This is clearly due to the lifting axiom.
The decision theory obtained captures either very risky
attitudes or some that are not decisive at all. As
preferential inference is very cautious, the relations on acts
which do not correspond to a total ordering on states will
not be very discriminating. On the contrary if the set of
states is totally ordered in terms of plausibility, the
decisions will be very risky because, as usual with
rational inference the decision maker will always assume
that the world is in the most normal state. Cautious
decisions will never be preferred.
Example. Consider the omelette example of Savage

(1972, pages 13 to 15). The problem is whether to add an
egg to a 5-egg omelette: The set of 6 consequences is as
in the following table:

STATES
ACTS
break the egg in
the omelette BIO
break it apart in a
cupBAC
throw it away TA

rotten egg

fresh egg

a 6 egg omelette (6) nothing to eat (1)
a 6 egg omelette,
a cup to wash (5)
a 5 egg omelette,
one spoiled egg (2)

a 5 egg omelette,
a cup to wash (3)
a 5 egg omelette
(4)

Integers between parentheses indicate the ordering of
consequences, in decreasing order of preference. The reader
can easily check that he agrees with this ordering. If fresh
egg is more likely than rotten egg then A(BIO;::; BAC) =
A(BIO � TA) = A(BAC � TA) ={fresh}>A(BAC � BIO)
A(TA � BIO) A(TA � BAC) = {rotten}. So the
decision making attitude induced by the approach is: break
the egg in the omelette if you think the egg is fresh,
throw it away if you think it is rotten, and do anything
you like if you have no opinion (all acts equally preferred
then). Clearly, this results in many starving days, and
garbage cans with lots of spoiled fresh eggs.

satisfactory. Applied to the egg example, it recommends
act BAC in case of relative ignorance on the egg state; see
(Dubois, Prade and Sabbadin, 1997). However that theory
relies on a commensurability

assumption between

uncertainty and preference, which may be questioned by
tenants of a purely symbolic approach.

This paper leads to an open question: Is there an
alternative to the lifting axiom that would enable a
reasonably cautious and albeit decisive ordering on acts to
be computed on the basis of uncertainty relations on
events and consequences? In other words, how to do away
with commensurability assumptions and/or numerical
approaches while capturing anthropomorphic decision
attitudes?

One might think of reverting the lifting procedure by
exchanging the role of states and consequences. It would
lead to express the preference on acts in terms of a
comparison of sets of consequences instead of sets of
states as done here. This would make us capable of
expressing attitudes of the decision maker in front of risk,
something that never explicitly appears in the Savage's set
of axioms. Indeed, a natural alternative to the lifting
principle used in this paper would rather start by
