INTRODUCTION

We live in a world which is full of variations and excep­
tions. Decision making in our daily lives involves skillfully
manipulating the myriad of phenomena and carefully ana­
lyzing the consequences of each relevant variation or
exception. For instance, in the clinical setting, tlle choice of

We propose such a representation design in this paper. The

characteristics and the complexities of a general frame­
work for reasoning with context-sensitive knowledge. In
particular, network or graph representations are found to be

very effective in expressing the variations and exceptions
involved.
There have been many efforts at integrating categorical or
hierarchical knowledge with uncertain knowledge (Lin and
Goebel 1990)(Saffiotti 1990)(Yen and Bonissone 1990).
No existing framework, however, captures the essence of
both, say, tlle inheritance graph of a specialization or "IS-

While this piece of (fictitious) information may not seem

immediately interesting from the decision making point fo
view, it illustrates some important representation require­
ments that our framework attempts to capture.

First, the different relevant phenomena must be explicitly
distinguishable, describable, and capable of supporting rea­
soning, e.g., elephant, royal elephant, color of elephant,
gray, white, Thailand, King of Thailand, etc. These descrip­

tions would constitute the basic building blocks of the

Representing Context-Sensitive Knowledge

representation framework.
Second, the different categorical or structural relations
among the phenomena must be expressible. Such relations
include the specialization or "a kind of' relation, e.g., royal
elephant is a kind of elephant, and the decomposition or
"part of' relation, the equivalence relation, etc.
Similarly, the different uncertain or behavioral relations
among the phenomena must be expressible. Instances of
such relations, as illustrated in the above example, include
those captured in the English phrases: "usually scares
away", "more likely to be found", and "always follow."

Lastly, there should be a construct that would capture the
context-dependent notions indicated in the Royal Elephant
Example: Only the royal elephants in Thailand are white in
color, and they can always be found when the King is
around. These facts or descriptions are not applicable to
royal elephants in general.

Elephant Example

Due to its simplicity, we shall refer to the Royal Elephant

Example throughout this paper to illustrate the major rep­
resentation constructs in our framework. Comments on
how these constructs are actually being employed will be
made whenever appropriate.
In the following sections, we shall describe the components

of the proposed framework, and examine some of the mo­
tivations behind our design choices. We shall also briefly
d iscus s the typical inferences in automated decision mak­
ing supported by the framework, and informally assess its
potential expressiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

REPRESENTATION OF CONCEPTS

In our framework, a concept is an intensional description of
the relational interpretation of an object, a state, a process,
or an attribute of these phenomena. In other words, a con­
cept reflects the salient features of the underlying
phenomenon through a set of interactions, i.e., correlation­
al, influential, or causal relations with other concepts. For
example, the concept royal elephant might comprise the
following relations 1:

A PARTIAL NETWORK
•

Figure 1 depicts some relevant parts of the network repre­
sentation for the Royal Elephant Example in our
framework. In the figure, the nodes represent the phenom­
ena or concepts being described, while the links represent
the relations among the concepts. Only one type of categor­
ical or structural relations is displayed: specialization
(AKO). Three types of uncertain or behavioral relations are
displayed: cause (c), positive-influence (+), and negative­
influence (-). A third type of relations, the context (CXT)
relation, induces a hypergraph on the network; the transi­
tive-closure of the context relation of a concept constitutes
its description. The (#) and (#*) signs in the figure should
be read as: "of', e.g., "King of Thailand", "Presence of
King of Thailand"; the(#*) sign is simply an abbreviation
of an imp licit chain of the(#) signs.
In contrast to early semantic networks with ad-hoc rela­
tions, to term-subsumption languages with only
subsumption (IS-A) relations, and to belief networks with
only probabilistic relations, our representation design ac­
commodates a spectrum of different relations with well­
defined, though not necessarily formal semantics. We shall
now look at the different components in more details.

"aie ofroyalelephantpositively-influences

len�th ofteeth ofroyalelephant".
"aen!lerofroyalelephant associates-with
sizeofroyalelephant", etc.

In these relations, concepts such as aaeofroyal elephant,
teeth ofroyal elephant aenderofroyal elephant and �
ofroyalelephants are related to royalelephant via the con­
teX! or CXT relation; they are called the properties of royal
elephant, and in tum may have their own properties, e.g.,
len�th of teeth of royal elephant is a property of teeth of

royalelephant.
The description of a concept, i.e., its properties and the in­
teractions among them, may be constrained by a set of
categorizers. A categorizer is a categorical or class rela­
tionship which establishes a unique perspective for
describing one concept in terms of another. For example,
asserting the relation: "royalelephant is a kind of elephant"
in the description of royal elephant implies that its proper­
ties and their corresponding interactions may have been

"abnonnal" or ''non-general" situations. For instance, in
the decision problem above, if a second disease, say Ac­
quired Immune-deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is present,
the decision maker should consider some subtypes of pneu­
monia which are different from those being considered in
the absence of AIDS.

Figure 2: Partial Description of the Royal Elephant
Concept
The rationale behind our design is discussed in detail in
(Leong 199la). In essence, the different relations defined
reflect the characteristics of the knowledge involved in sup­
porting dynamic decision modeling.
The interactions capture behavioral relations with varying
degrees of certainty among the concepts; these relations
support the task of identifying infonnation with varying de­
grees of significance in a particular situation. For instance,
in deciding a treatment plan for a disease, the decision mak­
er might wish to consider other events or conditions that
affect or are affected by the disease, e.g., its potential caus­
es, its symptoms, its complications, etc. The relevance of
these related events is discriminated according to the cer­
tainty or "strength" of their interactions with the disease.
The categorizers capture structural relations among !he
concepts; !hese relations support the task of reasoning at
multiple levels of details in decision modeling. For in­
stance, given !he presence of a disease, say pneumonia, a
decision maker might wish to prescribe treatment after de­
ciding which particular subtype of pneumonia is actually
present. The possible subtypes of pneumonia can be found
by tracing the concepts related to pneumonia via the spe­
cialization (AKO) relation.
One important component of our representation design is
the context (CXT) relation. This unique relation is neither
behavioral nor structural, instead, it can be regarded as a
higher-order relation that constrains the interpretations of
all other relation types in the framework. Explicit encoding
of the CXT relations provides a general mechanism to de­
scribe the concepts, in tenns of their other types of relations
among each other, in a context-sensitive rnanner.Such in­
fonnation is crucial for supporting decision modeling in

THE CONTEXT RELATION

Intuitively, the context or CXT relation delimits the
"scope" of the description of a concept in a network. All
concepts in our framework are denoted in tenns of the CXT
relation.
In general, all concepts reachable from a particular con­
cept, say C. via the CXT relations in the network are in the
description of C. A concept directly related to C via the
CXT relation is a property of C, denoted as (P#C), e.g.,
(King#Thailand), read: King of Thailand, and (Royal El­
ephant # Thailand),
read: Royal Elephant ofThailand.
The properties of a concept include its inherent qualities,
characteristics, and other relevant concepts that constitute
its description.
It follows that every concept is defined in some context. In

other words, all concepts can be expressed in the form of
(a # b). In this tuple notation, 9-is the "basic identity" of
the concept, and .b. is the "context" in which the concept is
defined; both entries are concepts themselves. The basic
identify of a concept is the most accurate general descrip­
tion of the concept. The context specifies the condition in
which the description of the denoted concept is valid, and
allows this description to vary, if necessary, from the basic
identity. There is a special concept, denoted as T, which is
defined to be itself; any concept defined in the context of T
is in the universal context, i.e., valid in general. For exam­
ple, the concepts !nl.man, elephant. mya1 elephant. etc., are
actually denoted as (Human# T), (Elephant#T), (Royal
Elephant # T}, and so forth. For simplicity, we shall omit
the universal context in our notations in this paper.
The tuple notation allows concepts to be "chained" to
form a new concept, analogous to the "role chaining"
notion in KL-ONE (Brachman and Schmolze 1985). For
instance, ((Color#Royal Elephant)#Thailand) is a con­
cept. The chaining expression is associative, and the
embedded parentheses are usually omitted.
The CXT relation, therefore, induces a "context tree"
among all the concepts defined in the knowledge base, with
the universal concept T as the root. This context hierarchy
serves two purposes: First, as we shall see below, it allows
expression of context-sensitive description of a concept in
tenns of its categorical and uncertain relations with other
concepts. Second, it serves as a focusing mechanism be­
cause, as we have noted earlier, every subtree in the
hierarchy contains all the relevant concepts in the descrip­
tion of the particular concept at the root of the subtree.

interactions among a set of concepts. For example,

3•2 BEHAVIORAL RELATIONS: INTERACTIONS
An interaction is a "behavioral" relationship between two

or more concepts. In the decision modeling context, the in­

teractions can be described in tenus of English words such
as "causes," "alleviates," "indicates,"

etc., in one extreme;

they can also be expressed as numeric conditional probabil­

ities between two or more concepts in another extreme. To
balance between intuitive expressiveness and semantic pre­

cision, our definitions integrate a temporal ordering notion
and a qualitative probabilistic interpretation.

Each interaction in our framework has two components:

temporal precedence, with "known" or "unknown" as val­
ues, and qualitative probabilistic influence
(Wellman

1 990b), with "positive", "negative", or "un­

known" as values. Different additive combinations of these

values allow us to express the behavioral relationships

STRUCTURE OF KNOWLEDGE BASE

So far we have outline the basic representation constructs

in our framework. By adopting a descriptive approach to
concept definition, we have developed a set of categoriclll

relations and a set of uncertain relations among the con­

cepts. These relations are further constrained by the CXT
relation to capture context-sensitive information in a uni­

directed graphs on the concepts. In particular, the CXT re­

lation hierarchy fonns a single directed tree on all the

selected as the King's rides.
In this case, we shall define a concept pink-taU royal ele­

phant of Thailand, which is kind of royal elephant of
Thailand. There is also a need to define another concept
called ride of Kin� ofThailand, with which we associate
the description for a typical ride for a king, e.g., the type of

concepts in the knowledge base. This imposed regularity on

the knowledge base, we believe, would facilitate the effi­
ciency of the inferences supported.

A major assumption that allows us to take advantage of the

network interpretation of the framework for supporting in­

when the concepts are defined. In other words, all the con­

definition is allowed. This strong assumption has simplified
the representation design process, but will likely to be elim­
inated as we progress to explore more complicated issues

and improve our design in the future.

As mentioned earlier, a subtree in the context hierarchy is

built for each concept defined., with its properties in tum as

mentation of the framework, we do not have to specify this

description in the definition of ride ofKin�,: ofThailand; as

long as the SC relation between the two concepts is assert­

ed, the corresponding structure should be automatically

copied when the knowledge base is constructed.

The SC relation is irreftexive, antisymmetric, and transi­

tive. Intuitively, the SC relation provides a means for
different concepts to share description under different con3· Another

Indeed, the number of distinct concepts that can be formed
from an initial set of n context-free concepts, i.e., concepts

defined in the universal concept T, are of O(n!) or O(n11).

The actual bound for the knowledge is actually infinite if

we allow a concept to appear more than once in a CXT

chain, e.g., (child# child# child#....# King# Thailand).

The space needed for the knowledge base could possibly be
huge. We believe, however, the situation is not that serious
because, in general, many of the CXT chaining combina­

tions do not make sense; the CXT hierarchy is usually
sparse.

5

INFERENCES SUPPORTED

Two classes of powerful inferences, inheritance and recog­

nition, are usually supported in hierarchical knowledge

representation systems of the semantic networks family.

Representing Context-Sensitive Knowledge

The presence of conflicting concept descriptions gives rise

to the exceptions and multiple inheritance problems in in­

" ® " operator is for combining intemction chains and the

heritance, and the partial matching problem in recognition
(Shastri 1989). Since we assume our knowledge base is a
fully established network of concept descriptions, we do
not anticipate most of the difficulties that research in inher­

itance theory or default reasoning (Touretzky, Harty and

Thomason 1987) encounters. As compared to these sys­

tems for supporting commonsense reasoning, however,
only a restricted set of inferences are provided in our
framework.

" $ " opemtor is for combining parallel intemctions. The
definitions are consistent with the opemtors for combining

influence chains and parallel i'!fluences in qualitative prob­
abilistic networks (QPNs). The corresponding operations

are commutative, associative, and distributive, just like or­

dinary multiplication and addition (Wellman 1990b). The
tables are indexed from intemction entries in "row" then
"column", and the net interaction is read from their intersection. For example,

would have been resolved, either by the conventions spec­

when the network is constructed. The multiple inheritance
problem in our framework is therefore addressed when the
knowledge base is constructed; the exceptions

are handled

by explicitly specifying the CXT relations in a unifonn
way. There is no run-time support for inheritance inferenc­

On the other hand, our framework is equipped to handle a
restricted class of the recognition problem; these problems
can be reduced to the simpler problem of finding a path in
a particular network imposed by a relation type, and then
interpreting the indirect relation between the concepts at
the beginning and the end of the path.

5•1

INDIRECT INTERACTIONS

There are two forms of indirections for interactions: inter­

5•2

Detennining the relationship between two concepts in a
particular categorization is straightforward, involving sim­
ply checking whether one concept is in the transitive
closure of the other. The context-sensitive nature of our
framework further allows, for example, the following types
of inferences to be dmwn on the categorizations:

action chains and parallel interactions. An example of the

•

former scenario is as follows:
•

•

Presenceofhuman negatively-influences
presence ofelephant
Presence ofelephantpositively-influences
presence ofmouse

A relevant query would be: W hat is the interaction between

preseoce ofhuman and presenceofmouse±?
Similarly, an example of the latter scenario is as follows:
•

•

Presence ofKiniofThailand causes
presence ofroyalelephantofThailand
Presence ofKini ofThailand

INDIRECT CATEGORIZATIONS

•

Elephant is a kind of animal

:w:tb. is a kind of llii.3lJ

We can conclude that:
•

Teeth of elephant is a kind of organ of animal

The detailed definition of such inferences is again docu­
mented in (Leong 1991a). In the specialization hierarchy,
this definition is analogous to the idea of derivative sub­

classification in OWL (Hawkinson 1975). The inferences
supported in our fmmework are generalized to all other cat­
egorical relations defined as well.

representation framework. We shall now examine how the
represented knowledge can be used to support dynamic for­
mulation of a decision model.
The decision-analytic approach to decision making

can be

viewed as a five-step process: 1) Background information
characterization;

2) domain context establishment; 3) deci­

sion problem fonnulation; 4) decision model construction;
and

5) decision model evaluation.

171

172

Leong

To sup(X)rt the above decision making process, the follow­
ing general types of queries are involved (Leong 1991b),
with the parameters in the angular brackets denoting the re­
lations defined in our framework:
•

•

•

•

(Ql) Does concept.Arelate to concept .B. by
<categorizer>?
(Q2) W hat are the concepts related to concept A
by <categorizer>?
(Q3) Does concept A relate to concept .!l by
<interaction>?
(Q4) What are the concepts related to concept A
by <interaction>?

For example, consider the following scenario:
The Tourist's Decision Problem

A tourist in Thailand had a very expensive cam­
era. One day very early in the nwming, He heard
from the radio that an elephant was spotted in a
nearby shopping mall. He would really like to take
a picture of a Royal Elephant, but the radio report
did not mention what type of elephant it was. The
decision is whether or not the tourist should bring
his camera to the shopping nwll, given a substan­

tial chance that the camera could be stolen.

A target decision model for the Tourist's Decision Problem
is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: A QPN for the Tourist's Decision Problem
Given the problem specification, and a knowledge base
containing all the relevant information about elephants and
a tourist's life in Thailand, the decision maker could formu­
Late the above decision model by (X)Sing a series of queries
to the knowledge base. Some examples of these queries, are
as follows:
•

•

W hat are the concepts related to Elephant by
specialization?
W hat are the concepts that positively-influence

chance of stolen camera?

•

etc.

To evaluate the decision model, the decision maker would
in tum (X)se a series of queries to the constructed decision
model as follows:
•

•

•

Does brin�-camern? relate to� by
(X)Sitive-influence?
Does brin�-camern? relate to� by
negative-influence?
etc.

All these queries are of the general forms Ql to Q4 as de­
fined above. As illustrated in the previous section, these
queries are sup(X)rted by the inferences (direct or indirect
interactions and categorizations) provided in our frame­
work.
The built-in context-sensitive nature of the representation
provides the decision maker with a general way of access­
ing variations in the domain information. For example, if
the Tourist's Decision Problem is (X)sed in a country other
than Thailand, the resulting target decision model might be
different because the royal elephants there, if present,
might be scared of people. The same set of queries, howev­
er, would be used by the decision maker to construct this
new decision model

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have briefly discussed the motivation and
the design approach for a representation framework that in­
tegrates categorical knowledge and uncertain knowledge in
a context-sensitive manner. Our design is based on a net­
work formalism which facilitates the interpretation and the
manipulation of the inheritance problem in the various re­
lations being modelled. By examining how the information
in the Royal Elephant Example can be represented, we
have demonstrated the expressiveness of our framework.
We have also argued that this expressiveness is adequate
for capturing many interesting phenomena essential for
sup(X)rting automated decision making.
Efficiency, i.e., how easily can the knowledge be accessed
in the framework, is demonstrated through a set of indirect
inference definitions. With these inferences, a restricted
class of the recognition problem can be reduced to a path­
finding problem. We (X)Stulate that instead of the NP-com­
plete classification mechanism being sup(X)rted in most
existing term-subsumption languages or representation
systems, simple path-finding graph algorithms of (X)lyno­
mial time complexity are adequate for our puf(X)se. More
rigorous analysis, however, needs to be done to substantiate
this claim.
We would like to conclude the informal evaluation of our
framework by examining its effectiveness, i.e., how well it
sup(X)rts the applications it is designed for. In this case, the
intended application is for sup(X)rting dynamic formulation
of decision models in automated decision analysis. We

Unfonunately, a rigorous evaluation is impossible until we

have an implemented system , which is planned for the near
future.

We believe our representation framework is applicable in
some other problem solving tasks as well. The restricted set
of inferences provided, however, renders it unsuitable for
supporting more general recognition problems. Moreover,
