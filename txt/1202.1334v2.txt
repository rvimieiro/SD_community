Abstract
Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement
learning problem where the learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action
and receives a reward based on the action and
context. We consider this problem under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in
a (known) function class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and
context. Under this assumption, we show three
things. We present a new algorithm—Regressor
Elimination— with a regret similar to the agnostic setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower bound
showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that
for any set of policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards (given
context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the previous approaches.

1 Introduction
We are interested in the online contextual bandit setting,
where on each round we first see a context x ∈ X , based
on which we choose an action a ∈ A, and then observe
a reward r. This formalizes several natural scenarios. For
example, a common task at major internet engines is to display the best ad from a pool of options given some context such as information about the user, the page visited,
the search query issued etc. The action set consists of the
candidate ads and the reward is typically binary based on
whether the user clicked the displayed ad or not. Another

natural application is the design of clinical trials in the medical domain. In this case, the actions are the treatment options being compared, the context is the patient’s medical
record and reward is based on whether the recommended
treatment is a success or not.
Our goal in this setting is to compete with a particular set
of policies, which are deterministic rules specifying which
action to choose in each context. We note that this setting includes as special cases the classical K-armed bandit problem (Lai and Robbins, 1985) and associative reinforcement learning with linear reward functions (Auer,
2003; Chu et al., 2011).
The performance of algorithms in this setting is typically
measured by the regret, which is the difference between the
cumulative reward of the best policy and the algorithm. For
the setting with an arbitrary
set of policies, the achieved rep
gret guarantee is O( KT ln(N/δ)) where K is the number of actions, T is the number of rounds, N is the number of policies and δ is the probability of failing to achieve
the regret (Beygelzimer et al., 2010; Dudı́k et al., 2011).
While this bound has a desirably small dependence on the
parameters T, N , the scaling with respect to K is often too
big to be meaningful. For instance, the number of ads under consideration can be huge, and a rapid scaling with the
number of alternatives in a clinical trial is clearly undesirable. Unfortunately, the dependence on K is unavoidable
as proved by existing lower bounds (Auer et al., 2003).
Large literature on “linear bandits” manages to avoid this
dependence on K by making additional assumptions. For
example, Auer (2003) and Chu et al. (2011) consider the
setting where the context x consists of feature vectors xa ∈
Rd describing each action, and the expected reward function (given a context x and action a) has the form wT xa
for some fixed vector w ∈ Rd . Dani et al. (2008) consider
a continuous action space with a ∈ Rd , without contexts,
with a linear expected reward wT a, which is generalized
by Filippi et al. (2010) to σ(wT a) with a known Lipschitzcontinuous link function σ. A striking aspect of the linear and generalized linear setting is that while the regret

Contextual Bandit Learning with Predictable Rewards

grows rapidly with the dimension d, it grows either only
gently with the number of actions K (poly-logarithmic
for Auer, 2003), or is independent of K (Dani et al., 2008;
Filippi et al., 2010). In this paper, we investigate whether
a weaker dependence on the number of actions is possible
in more general settings. Specifically, we omit the linearity
assumption while keeping the “realizability”—i.e., we still
assume that the expected reward can be perfectly modeled,
but do not require this to be a linear or a generalized linear
model.
We consider an arbitrary class F of functions f : (X , A) →
[0, 1] that map a context and an action to a real number. We
interpret f (x, a) as a predicted expected reward of the action a on context x and refer to functions in F as regressors. For example, in display advertising, the context is
a vector of features derived from the text and metadata of
the webpage and information about the user. The action
corresponds to the ad, also described by a set of features.
Additional features might be used to model interaction between the ad and the context. A typical regressor for this
problem is a generalized linear model with a logistic link,
modeling the probability of a click.
The set of regressors F induces a natural set of policies
ΠF containing maps πf : X → A defined as πf (x) =
argmaxa f (x, a). We make the assumption that the expected reward for a context x and action a equals f ∗ (x, a)
for some unknown function f ∗ ∈ F . The question we address in this paper is: Does this realizability assumption
allow us to learn faster?
We show that for an arbitrary function
√ class, the answer
to the above question is “no”. The K dependence in regret is in general unavoidable even with the realizability
assumption. Thus, the structure of linearity or controlled
non-linearity was quite important in the past works.
Given this answer, a natural question is whether it is at least
possible to do better in various special cases. To answer
this, we create a new natural algorithm, Regressor Elimination (RE), which takes advantage of realizability. Structurally, the algorithm is similar to Policy Elimination (PE)
of Dudı́k et al. (2011), designed for the agnostic case (i.e,
the general case without realizability assumption). While
PE proceeds by eliminating poorly performing policies,
RE proceeds by eliminating poorly predicting regressors.
However, realizability assumption allows much more aggressive elimination strategy, different from the strategy
used in PE. The analysis of this elimination strategy is the
key technical contribution of this paper.
Thepgeneral regret guarantee for Regressor Elimination is
O( KT ln(N T /δ)), similar to the agnostic case. However, we also show that for all sets of policies Π there exists
a set of regressors F such that Π = ΠF and the regret of
Regressor Elimination is O(ln(N/δ)), i.e., independent of
the number of rounds and actions. At the first sight, this

seems to contradict our worst-case lower bound. This apparent paradox is due to the fact that the same set of policies
can be generated by two very different sets of regressors.
Some regressor sets allow better discrimination of the true
reward function, whereas some regressor sets will lead to
the worst-case guarantee.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
the next section we formalize our setting and assumptions.
Section 3 provides our algorithm which is analyzed in Section 4. In Section 5 we present the worst-case lower bound,
and in Section 6, we show an improved dependence on
K in favorable cases. Our algorithm assumes the exact
knowledge of the distribution over contexts (but not over
rewards). In Section 7 we sketch how this assumption can
be removed. Another major assumption is the finiteness of
the set of regressors F . This assumption is more difficult
to remove, as we discuss in Section 8.

2 Problem Setup
We assume that the interaction between the learner and nature happens over T rounds. At each round t, nature picks
a context xt ∈ X and a reward function rt : A → [0, 1]
sampled i.i.d. in each round, according to a fixed distribution D(x, r). We assume that D(x) is known (this assumption is removed in Section 7), but D(r|x) is unknown. The
learner observes xt , picks an action at ∈ A, and observes
the reward for the action rt (at ). We are given a function
class F : X × A → [0, 1] with |F | = N , where |F | is
the cardinality of F . We assume that F contains a perfect
predictor of the expected reward:
Assumption 1 (Realizability). There exists a function f ∗ ∈
F such that Er|x [r(a)] = f ∗ (x, a) for all x ∈ X , a ∈ A.
We recall as before that the regressor class F induces the
policy class ΠF containing maps πf : X → A defined by
f ∈ F as πf (x) = argmaxa f (x, a). The performance of
an algorithm is measured by its expected regret relative to
the best fixed policy:
regretT = sup

3 Algorithm
Our algorithm, Regressor Elimination, maintains a set of
regressors that accurately predict the observed rewards. In
each round, it chooses an action that sufficiently explores

Agarwal, Dudı́k, Kale, Langford and Schapire

among the actions represented in the current set of regressors (Steps 1–2). After observing the reward (Step 3), the
inaccurate regressors are eliminated (Step 4).
Sufficient exploration is achieved by solving the convex optimization problem in Step 1. We construct a distribution
Pt over current regressors, and then act by first sampling
a regressor f ∼ Pt and then choosing an action according to πf . Similarly to the Policy Elimination algorithm
of Dudı́k et al. (2011), we seek a distribution Pt such that
the inverse probability of choosing an action that agrees
with any policy in the current set is in expectation bounded
from above. Informally, this guarantees that actions of any
of the current policies are chosen with sufficient probabilities. Using this construction we relate the accuracy of regressors to the regret of the algorithm (Lemma 4.3).
A priori, it is not clear whether the constraint (3.1) is even
feasible. We prove feasibility by a similar argument as
in Dudı́k et al. (2011) (see Lemma A.1 in Appendix A).
Compared with Dudı́k et al. (2011) we are able to obtain
tighter constraints by doing a more careful analysis.
Our elimination step (Step 4) is significantly tighter than a
similar step in Dudı́k et al. (2011): we eliminate regressors
according to a very strict O(1/t) bound on the suboptimality of the least squares error. Under the realizability assumption, this stringent constraint will not discard the optimal regressor accidentally, as we show in the next section.
This is the key novel technical contribution of this work.
Replacing D(x) in the Regressor Elimination algorithm
with the empirical distribution over observed contexts is
straightforward, as was done in Dudı́k et al. (2011), and is
discussed further in Section 7.

4 Regret Analysis
Here we prove an upper bound on the regret of Regressor
Elimination. The proved bound is no better than the one for
existing agnostic algorithms. This is necessary, as we will
see in Section 5, where we prove a matching lower bound.
Theorem 4.1. For all sets of regressors F with |F | = N
and all distributions D(x, r), with probability
1 − δ, the
p
regret of Regressor Elimination is O( KT ln(N T /δ)).

Proof. By Lemma 4.1 (proved below), in round t if we
sample an action by sampling f frompPt and choosing
πf (xt ), then the expected regret is O( K ln(N T /δ)/t)
with probability at least 1 − δ/2t2 . The excess regret for sampling a uniform random action is at most

at least 1 − δ. Further, the net regret is a martingale; hence the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality with range

have a regret of O KT ln(N T /δ) + T ln(1/δ) =

Lemma 4.1. With probability at least 1 − δt N t log2 (t) ≥
1 − δ/2t2 , we have:
1. f ∗ ∈ Ft .

Proof. Fix an arbitrary function f ∈ F . For every round t,
define the random variable
Yt = (f (xt , at ) − rt (at ))2 − (f ∗ (xt , at ) − rt (at ))2 .
Here, xt is drawn from the unknown data distribution D,
rt is drawn from the reward distribution conditioned on xt ,
and at is drawn from Pt′ (which is defined conditioned on

Contextual Bandit Learning with Predictable Rewards

the choice of xt and is independent of rt ). Note that this
random variable is well-defined for all functions f ∈ F ,
not just the ones in Ft .
Let Et [·] and Vart [·] denote the expectation and variance
conditioned on all the randomness up to round t. Using
a form of Freedman’s inequality from Bartlett et al. (2008)
(see Lemma B.1) and noting that Yt ≤ 1, we get that with
probability at least 1 − δt log2 (t), we have

This gives −Z ≤ 18C 2 . Since Z = t(R̂t (f ) − R̂t (f ∗ )),
we get that

Furthermore, suppose f is also not eliminated and survives
in Ft . Then we must have R̂t (f ) − R̂t (f ∗ ) ≤ 18C 2 /t, or
in other words, Z ≤ 18C 2 . Thus, (X − 4C)2 ≤ 36C 2 ,
which implies that X 2 ≤ 100C 2 , and hence:

By Lemma 4.3 and since Pt is measurable with respect to
the past sigma field up to time t − 1, for all t′ ≤ t we have

5 Lower bound
Here we prove a lower bound showing that the realizability
assumption is not enough in general to eliminate a dependence on the number of actions K. The structure of this
proof is similar to an earlier lower bound (Auer et al., 2003)
differing in two ways: it applies to regressors of the sort we
consider, and we work N , the number of regressors, into
the lower bound. Since for every policy there exists a regressor with argmax on that regressor realizing the policy,
this lower bound also applies to policy based algorithms.
Theorem 5.1. For every N and K such that ln N/ ln K ≤
T , and every algorithm A, there exists a function class F of
cardinality at most N and a distribution D(x, r) for which
the realizability
assumption holds, but the expected regret
p
of A is Ω( KT ln N/ ln K).
Proof. Instead of directly selecting
F and D for which the
p
expected regret of A is Ω( KT ln N/ ln K), we create a
distribution over instances
p (F, D) and show that the expected regret of A is Ω( KT ln N/ ln K) when the expectation is taken also over our choice of the instance. This
will immediately yield a statement of the theorem, since
the algorithm must suffer at least this amount of regret on
one of the instances.

The proof proceeds via a reduction to the construction
used in the lower bound of Theorem 5.1 of Auer et al.
(2003). We will use M different contexts for a suitable
number M . To define the regressor class F , we begin with
the policy class G consisting of all the K M mappings of
the form g : X → A, where X = {1, 2, . . . , M } and
A = {1, 2, . . . , K}. We require M to be the largest integer such that K M ≤ N , i.e., M = ⌊ln N/ ln K⌋. Each
mapping g ∈ G defines a regressor fg ∈ F as follows:
(
1/2 + ǫ if a = g(x)
fg (x, a) =
1/2
otherwise.
The rewards are generated by picking a function f ∈ F
uniformly at random at the beginning. Equivalently, we
choose a mapping g that independently maps each context
x ∈ X to a random action a ∈ A, and set f = fg . In each
round t, a context xt is picked uniformly from X . For any
action a, a reward rt (a) is generated as a {0, 1} Bernoulli
trial with probability of 1 being equal to f (x, a).
Now fix a context x ∈ X . We condition on all of the randomness of the algorithm A, the choices of the contexts xt
for t = 1, 2, . . . , T , and the values of g(x′ ) for x′ 6= x.
Thus the only randomness left is in the choice of g(x) and
the realization of the rewards in each round. Let P′ denote
the reward distribution where the rewards of any action a
for context x are chosen to be {0, 1} uniformly at random
(the rewards for other contexts x′ 6= x are still chosen according to f (x′ , a), however), and let E′ denote the expectation under P′ .

Contextual Bandit Learning with Predictable Rewards

Let Tx be the rounds t where the context xt is x. Now fix
an action a ∈ A and let Sa be a random variable denoting
the number of rounds t ∈ Tx when A chooses at = a.
Note that conditioned on g(x) = a, the random variable
Sa counts the number of rounds in Tx that A chooses the
optimal action a.

for t = 1, 2, . . . , T by taking an expectation, we get the
following lower bound on the expected regret of A:

We use a corollary of Lemma A.1 in Auer et al. (2003):

Note
 that
 |Tx | is distributed as Binomial(T, 1/M ). Thus,

using P′ are identical to those from the true distribution

the choices of the contexts xt for t = 1, 2, . . . , T , and g(x′ )

6 Analysis of nontriviality
Since the worst-case regret bound of our new algorithm is
the same as for agnostic algorithms, a skeptic could conclude that there is no power in the realizability assumption.
Here, we show that in some cases, realizability assumption
can be very powerful in reducing regret.
Theorem 6.1. For any algorithm A working with a set of
policies (rather than regressors), there exists a set of regressors F and a distribution D satisfying the realizability
assumption
such that the regret of A using the set ΠF is
√
Ω̃( T K ln N ), but the expected regret of Regressor Elimination using F is at most O ln(N/δ) .

Proof. Let F ′ be the set of functions and D the data distribution that achieve the lower bound of Theorem 5.1 for
the algorithm A. Using Lemma 6.1 (see below), there exists a set of functions F such that ΠF = ΠF ′ and the expected regret
 of Regressor Elimination using F is at most
O ln(N/δ) . This set of functions F and distribution D
satisfy the requirements of the theorem.

Lemma 6.1. For any distribution D and a set of policies Π
containing the optimal policy, there exists a set of functions
F satisfying the realizability assumption, such that Π =
ΠF and the regret
 of regressor elimination using F is at
most O ln(N/δ) .

Agarwal, Dudı́k, Kale, Langford and Schapire

Proof. The idea is to build a set of functions F such that
Π = ΠF , and for the optimal policy π ∗ the corresponding function f ∗ exactly gives the expected rewards for each
context x and a, but for any other policy π the corresponding function f gives a terrible estimate, allowing regressor
elimination to eliminate them quickly.
The construction is as follows. For π ∗ , we define the function f ∗ as f ∗ (x, a) = Ex,r [r(a)]. By optimality of π ∗ ,
πf ∗ = π ∗ . For every other policy π we construct an f
such that π = πf but for which f (x, a) is a very bad
estimate of Ex,r [r(a)] for all actions a. Fix x and consider two cases: the first is that Er|x [r(π(x))] > 0.75
and the other is that Er|x [r(π(x))] ≤ 0.75. In the first
case, we let f (x, π(x)) = 0.51. In the second case we let
f (x, π(x)) = 1.0. Now consider each other action a′ in
turn. If Er|x [r(a′ )] > 0.25 then we let f (x, a′ ) = 0, and if
Er|x [r(a′ )] ≤ 0.25 we let f (x, a′ ) = 0.5.
The regressor elimination algorithm eliminates regressor
with a too-large squared loss regret. Now fix any policy
π 6= π ∗ , and the corresponding f , define, as in the proof of
Lemma 4.1, the random variable
Yt = (f (xt , at ) − rt (at ))2 − (f ∗ (xt , at ) − rt (at ))2 .
Note that

since for all (x, a), (f (x, a)−f ∗ (x, a))2 ≥ 20
by construction. This shows that the expected regret is significant.

Now suppose f is not eliminated and remains in Ft . Then
by equation 4.1 we get:
t

Et′ [Yt′ ] ≤ 100 ln(1/δt ).

t =1

The above bound holds with probability 1 − δt N t log2 (t)
uniformly for all f ∈ Ft . Using the choice of δt =
δ/2N t3 log2 (t), we note that the bound fails to hold when
t > 106 ln(N/δ). Thus, within 106 ln(N/δ) rounds all
suboptimal regressors are eliminated, and the algorithm
suffers no regret thereafter. Since the rewards are bounded
in [0, 1], the total regret in the first 106 ln(N/δ) rounds can
be at most 106 ln(N/δ), giving us the desired bound.

7 Removing the dependence on D
While Algorithm 1 is conceptually simple and enjoys nice
theoretical guarantees, it has a serious drawback that it depends on the distribution D from which the contexts xt ’s
are drawn in order to specify the constraint (3.1). A similar
issue was faced in the earlier work of Dudı́k et al. (2011),
where they replace the expectation under D with a sample

average over the contexts observed. We now discuss a similar modification for Algorithm 1 and give a sketch of the
regret analysis.
The key change in Algorithm 1 is to replace the constraint (3.1) with the sample version.
Let Ht =
{x1 , x2 , . . . , xt−1 }, and denote by x ∼ Ht the act of selecting a context x from Ht uniformly at random. Now we
pick a distribution Pt on Ft−1 such that
∀f ∈ Ft−1 : E

Since Lemma A.1 applies to any distribution on the contexts, in particular, the uniform distribution on Ht , this
constraint is still feasible. To justify this sample based
approximation, we appeal to Theorem 6 of Dudı́k et al.
(2011) which shows that for any ǫ ∈ (0, 1) and t ≥

8 Conclusion
The included results gives us a basic understanding of the
realizable assumption setting: it can, but does not necessarily, improve our ability to learn.
We did not address computational complexity in this paper. There are some reasons to be hopeful however. Due
to the structure of the realizability assumption, an eliminated regressor continues to have an increasingly poor regret over time, implying that it may be possible to avoid the
elimination step and simply restrict the set of regressors we
care about when constructing a distribution. A basic question then is: can we make the formation of this distribution
computationally tractable?
Another question for future research is the extension to infinite function classes. One would expect that this just involves replacing the log cardinality with something like a
metric entropy or Rademacher complexity of F . This is not
completely immediate since we are dealing with martingales, and direct application of covering arguments seems

√
to yield a suboptimal O(1/ t) rate in Lemma 4.1. Extending the variance based bound coming from Freedman’s
inequality from a single martingale to a supremum over
function classes would need a Talagrand-style concentration inequality for martingales which is not available in the
literature to the best of our knowledge. Understanding this
issue better is an interesting topic for future work.

Proof. Let ∆t−1 refer to the space of all distributions on
Ft−1 . We observe that ∆t−1 is a convex, compact set. For
a distribution Q ∈ ∆t−1 , define the conditional distribution
Q̃(·|x) on A as sample f ∼ Q, and return πf (x). Note
that Q′ (a|x) = (1 − µ)Q̃(a|x) + µ/Kx, where Kx :=
|A(Ft−1 , x)| for notational convenience.
