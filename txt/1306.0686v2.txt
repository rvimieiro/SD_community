Abstract
Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention recently due to its
several applications in distributed, web-based
learning problems. In this paper we provide a
systematic study of the topic, and analyze the
effect of delay on the regret of online learning
algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns
out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and
in an additive way in stochastic problems.
We give meta-algorithms that transform, in
a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for
the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback
loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB
algorithm are also developed for the bandit
problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they
can be implemented with lower complexity.

1. Introduction
In this paper we study sequential learning when the
feedback about the predictions made by the forecaster are delayed. This is the case, for example, in
web advertisement, where the information whether a
user has clicked on a certain ad may come back to
the engine in a delayed fashion: after an ad is selected, while waiting for the information if the user
clicks or not, the engine has to provide ads to other
users. Also, the click information may be aggregated
and then periodically sent to the module that decides
about the ads, resulting in further delays. (Li et al.,
2010; Dudik et al., 2011). Another example is parallel,
distributed learning, where propagating information
among nodes causes delays (Agarwal & Duchi, 2011).

While online learning has proved to be successful in
many machine learning problems and is applied in
practice in situations where the feedback is delayed,
the theoretical results for the non-delayed setup are
not applicable when delays are present. Previous work
concerning the delayed setting focussed on specific online learning settings and delay models (mostly with
constant delays). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of delays is missing. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of online learning problems
with delayed feedback. We consider the partial monitoring setting, which covers all settings previously considered in the literature, extending, unifying, and often
improving upon existing results. In particular, we give
general meta-algorithms that transform, in a blackbox fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed
case into algorithms that can handle delays efficiently.
We analyze how the delay effects the regret of the algorithms. One interesting, perhaps somewhat surprising,
result is that the delay inflates the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, while this effect
is only additive in stochastic problems. While our general meta-algorithms are useful, their time- and spacecomplexity may be unnecessarily large. To resolve this
problem, we work out modifications of variants of the
UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) for stochastic bandit problems with delayed feedback that have much
smaller complexity than the black-box algorithms.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The problem of online learning with delayed feedback is defined
in Section 2. The adversarial and stochastic problems
are analyzed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, while the modification of the UCB algorithm is given in Section 4.
Some proofs, as well as results about the KL-UCB algorithm (Garivier & Cappé, 2011) under delayed feedback, are provided in the appendix.

2. The delayed feedback model
We consider a general model of online learning, which
we call the partial monitoring problem with side in-

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

Parameters: Forecaster’s prediction set A, set of outcomes B, side information set X , reward function r :
X × A × B → R, feedback function h : X × A × B → H,
time horizon n (optional).
At each time instant t = 1, 2, . . . , n:
1. The environment chooses some side information
xt ∈ X and an outcome bt ∈ B.
2. The side information xt is presented to the forecaster, who makes a prediction at ∈ A, which
results in the reward r(xt , at , bt ) (unknown to the
forecaster).
3. The feedback ht = h(xt , at , bt ) is scheduled to be
revealed after τt time instants.
4. The agent observes Ht = {(t′ , ht′ ) : t′ ≤ t, t′ +
τt′ = t}, i.e., all the feedback values scheduled
to be revealed at time step t, together with their
timestamps.

formation. In this model, the forecaster (decision
maker) has to make a sequence of predictions (actions), possibly based on some side information, and
for each prediction it receives some reward and feedback, where the feedback is delayed. More formally,
given a set of possible side information values X , a
set of possible predictions A, a set of reward functions
R ⊂ {r : X × A → R}, and a set of possible feedback
values H, at each time instant t = 1, 2, . . ., the forecaster receives some side information xt ∈ X ; then,
possibly based on the side information, the forecaster
predicts some value at ∈ A while the environment simultaneously chooses a reward function rt ∈ R; finally, the forecaster receives reward rt (xt , at ) and some
time-stamped feedback set Ht ⊂ N × H. In particular,
each element of Ht is a pair of time index and a feedback value, the time index indicating the time instant
whose decision the associated feedback corresponds to.
Note that the forecaster may or may not receive any direct information about the rewards it receives (i.e., the
rewards may be hidden). In standard online learning,
the feedback-set Ht is a singleton and the feedback in
this set depends on rt , at . In the delayed model, however, the feedback that concerns the decision at time t
is received at the end of the time period t+τt , after the
prediction is made, i.e., it is delayed by τt time steps.
Note that τt ≡ 0 corresponds to the non-delayed case.
Due to the delays multiple feedbacks may arrive at the
same time, hence the definition of Ht .

The goal of P
the forecaster is to maximize its cumulative reward nt=1 rt (xt , at ) (n ≥ 1). The performance
of the forecaster is measured relative to the best static
strategy selected from some set F ⊂ {f | f : X → A}
in hindsight. In particular, the forecaster’s performance is measured through the regret, defined by
Rn = sup

n
X

a∈F t=1

rt (xt , a(xt )) −

n
X

rt (xt , at ).

t=1

A forecaster is consistent if it achieves, asymptotically,
the average reward of the best static strategy, that is
E [Rn ] /n → 0, and we are interested in how fast the
average regret can be made to converge to 0.
The above general problem formulation includes most
scenarios considered in online learning. In the full
information case, the feedback is the reward function itself, that is, H = R and Ht = {(t, rt )}) (in
the non-delayed case). In the bandit case, the forecaster only learns the rewards of its own prediction,
i.e., H = R and Ht = {(t, rt (xt , at ))}. In the partial monitoring case, the forecaster is given a reward
function r : X × A × B → R and a feedback function h : X × A × B → H, where B is a set of choices
(outcomes) of the environment. Then, for each time
instant the environment picks an outcome bt ∈ B,
and the reward becomes rt (xt , at ) = r(xt , at , bt ), while
Ht = {(t, h(xt , at , bt ))}. This interaction protocol is
shown in Figure 1 in the delayed case. Note that
the bandit and full information problems can also be
treated as special partial monitoring problems. Therefore, we will use this last formulation of the problem.
When no stochastic assumption is made on how the
sequence bt is generated, we talk about the adversarial
model. In the stochastic setting we will consider the
case when bt is a sequence of independent, identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Side information may or may not be present in a real problem; in
its absence X is a singleton set.
Finally, we may have different assumptions on the delays. Most often, we will assume that (τt )t≥1 is an i.i.d.
sequence, which is independent of the past predictions
(as )s≤t of the forecaster. In the stochastic setting, we
also allow the distribution of τt to depend on at .
Note that the delays may change the order of observing the feedbacks, with the feedback of a more recent
prediction being observed before the feedback of an
earlier one.

and different assumptions on the delay. A concise summary, together with the contributions of this paper, is
given in Table 1.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) were the first to
analyze the delayed feedback problem; they considered the adversarial full information setting with
a fixed, known delay τconst . They showed that
the minimax optimal solution is to run τconst + 1
independent optimal predictors on the subsampled
reward sequences: τconst + 1 prediction strategies
are used such that the ith predictor is used at time
instants t with (t mod (τconst + 1)) + 1 = i. This
approach forms the basis of our method devised for
the adversarial case (see Section 3.1). Langford et al.
(2009) showed that under the usual conditions, a
sufficiently slowed-down version of the mirror descent
algorithm achieves optimal decay rate of the average
regret. Mesterharm (2005; 2007) considered another
variant of the full information setting, using an
adversarial model on the delays in the label prediction setting, where the forecaster has to predict
the label corresponding to a side information vector

xt . While in the full information online prediction
problem Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) showed
that the regret increases by a multiplicative factor of
τconst , in the work of Mesterharm (2005; 2007) the
important quantity becomes the maximum/average
gap defined as the length of the largest time interval
the forecaster does not receive feedback. Mesterharm
(2005; 2007) also shows that the minimax regret in
the adversarial case increases multiplicatively by the
average gap, while it increases only in an additive
fashion in the stochastic case, by the maximum gap.
Agarwal & Duchi (2011) considered the problem of
online stochastic optimization and showed that, for
i.i.d. random delays, the
increases with an
 regret

additive factor of order E τ 2 .

Qualitatively similar results were obtained in the
bandit setting. Considering a fixed and known delay τconst
√, Dudik et al. (2011) showed an additive
O(τconst log n) penalty in the regret for the stochastic setting (with side information), while (Neu et al.,
2010) showed a multiplicative regret for the adversarial
bandit case. The problem of delayed feedback has also
been studied for Gaussian process bandit optimization

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

(Desautels et al., 2012), resulting in a multiplicative
increase in the regret that is independent of the delay and an additive term depending on the maximum
delay.
In the rest of the paper we generalize the above results
to the partial monitoring setting, extending, unifying,
and often improving existing results.

3. Black-Box Algorithms for Delayed
Feedback
In this section we provide black-box algorithms for the
delayed feedback problem. We assume that there exists a base algorithm Base for solving the prediction
problem without delay. We often do not specify the
assumptions underlying the regret bounds of these algorithms, and assume that the problem we consider
only differs from the original problem because of the
delays. For example, in the adversarial setting, Base
may build on the assumption that the reward functions are selected in an oblivious or non-oblivious way
(i.e., independently or not of the predictions of the
forecaster). First we consider the adversarial case in
Section 3.1. Then in Section 3.2, we provide tighter
bounds for the stochastic case.
3.1. Adversarial setting
We say that a prediction algorithm enjoys a regret or expected regret bound f : [0, ∞) → R under the given assumptions in the non-delayed setting if (i) f is nondecreasing, concave, f (0) = 0;
and (ii) supb1 ,...,bn ∈B Rn ≤ f (n) or, respectively,
supb1 ,...,bn ∈B E [Rn ] ≤ f (n) for all n. The algorithm
of Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) for the adversarial full information setting subsamples the reward sequence by the constant delay τconst +1, and runs a base
algorithm Base on each of the τconst + 1 subsampled
sequences. Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) showed
that if Base enjoys a regret bound f then their algorithm in the fixed delay case enjoys a regret bound
(τconst + 1)f (n/(τconst + 1)). Furthermore, when Base
is minimax optimal in the non-delayed setting, the subsampling algorithm is also minimax optimal in the (full
information) delayed setting, as can be seen by constructing a reward sequence that changes only in every
τconst + 1 times. Note that Weinberger & Ordentlich
(2002) do not require condition (i) of f . However,
these conditions imply that yf (x/y) is a concave function of y for any fixed x (a fact which will turn out to
be useful in the analysis later), and are satisfied by all
regret bounds we are aware of (e.g., for multi-armed
bandits, contextual bandits, partial monitoring, etc.),

e α)
which all have a regret upper bound of the form O(n
for some 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, with, typically, α = 1/2 or 2/3.1 .

In this section we extend the algorithm of
Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) to the case when the
delays are not constant, and to the partial monitoring
setting. The idea is that we run several instances of
a non-delayed algorithm Base as needed: an instance
is “free” if it has received the feedback corresponding
to its previous prediction – before this we say that
the instance is “busy”, waiting for the feedback.
When we need to make a prediction, we use one of
existing instances that is free, and is hence ready to
make another prediction. If no such instance exists,
we create a new one to be used (a new instance is
always “free”, as it is not waiting for the feedback of a
previous prediction). The resulting algorithm, which
we call Black-Box Online Learning under Delayed
feedback (BOLD) is shown below (note that when the
delays are constant, BOLD reduces to the algorithm
of Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002)):

Algorithm 1 Black-box Online Learning under Delayed feedback (BOLD)
for each time instant t = 1, 2, . . . , n do
Prediction:
Pick a free instance of Base (independently
of past predictions), or create a new instance if
all existing instances are busy. Feed the instance
picked with xt and use its prediction.
Update:
for each (s, hs ) ∈ Ht do
Update the instance used at time instant s with
the feedback hs .
end for
end for

Clearly, the performance of BOLD depends on how
many instances of Base we need to create, and how
many times each instance is used. Let Mt denote the
number of Base instances created by BOLD up to
and including time t. That is, M1 = 1, and we create a new instance at the beginning of any time instant whenP
all instances are waiting for their feedback.
t−1
Let Gt = s=1 I {s + τs ≥ t} be the total number of
outstanding (missing) feedbacks when the forecaster
is making a prediction at time instant t. Then we
have Gt algorithms waiting for their feedback, and so
Mt ≥ Gt + 1. Since we only introduce new instances
when it is necessary (and each time instant at most
1
e n ) means that there is a β ≥ 0 such that
un = O(v
limn→∞ un /(vn logβ n) = 0.

one new instance is created), it is easy to see that
Mt = G∗t + 1

Now, using the fact that fBase is an (expected) regret
bound, we obtain

for any t, where G∗t = max1≤s≤t Gt .

E [Rn |τ1 , . . . , τn ] ≤

We can use the result above to transfer the regret guarantee of the non-delayed base algorithm Base to a
guarantee on the regret of BOLD.
Theorem 1. Suppose that the non-delayed algorithm
Base used in BOLD enjoys an (expected) regret bound
fBase . Assume, furthermore, that the delays τt are independent of the forecaster’s prediction at . Then the
expected regret of BOLD after n time steps satisfies

Proof. As the second inequality follows from the concavity of y 7→ yfBase (x/y) (x, y > 0), it remains to
prove the first one.
For any 1 ≤ j ≤ Mn , let Lj denote the list of time
instants in which BOLD has used the prediction chosen by instance j, and let nj = |Lj | be the number
of time instants this happens. Furthermore, let Rnj j
denote the regret incurred during the time instants t

where the first inequality follows since Mn is a deterministic function of the delays, while the last inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality and the concavity

Now, we need to bound G∗n to make the theorem meaningful. When all delays are the same constants, for
n > τconst we get G∗n = τt = τconst , and we get back
the regret bound

of Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002), thus generalizing their result to partial monitoring.
We do
not know whether this bound is tight even when
Base is minimax optimal, as the argument of
Weinberger & Ordentlich (2002) for the lower bound
does not work in the partial information setting (the
forecaster can gain extra information in each block
with the same reward functions).
Assuming the delays are i.i.d., we can give an interesting bound on G∗n . The result is based on the fact that
although Gt can be as large as t, both its expectation
and variance are upper bounded by E [τ1 ].
Lemma 2. Assume τ1 , . . . , τn is a sequence of i.i.d.
random variables with√finite expected value, and let
B(n, t) = t + 2 log n + 4t log n. Then
E [G∗n ] ≤ B(n, E [τ1 ]) + 1.
Proof. First consider the expectation and the variance

with probability at least 1 − δ,

Note that although the delays can be arbitrarily large,
whenever the expected value is finite, the bound only
increases by a log n factor.
3.2. Finite stochastic setting
In this section, we consider the case when the prediction set A of the forecaster is finite; without loss of
generality we assume A = {1, 2, . . . , K}. We also assume that there is no side information (that is, xt is
a constant for all t, and, hence, will be omitted; the
results can be extended easily to the case of a finite
side information set, where we can repeat the procedures described below for each value of the side information separately). The main assumption in this
section is that the outcomes (bt )t≥1 form an i.i.d. sequence, which is also independent of the predictions
of the forecaster. When B is finite, this leads to the
standard i.i.d. partial monitoring (IPM) setting, while
the conventional multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting is
recovered when the feedback is the reward of the last
prediction, that is, ht = rt (at , bt ). As in the previous section, we will assume that the feedback delays
are independent of the outcomes of the environment.
The main result of this section shows that under these
assumptions, the penalty in the regret grows in an additive fashion due to the delays, as opposed to the multiplicative penalty that we have seen in the adversarial
case.

By the independence assumption on the outcomes, the
.
sequences of potential rewards rt (i) = r(i, bt ) and feed.
backs ht (i) = h(i, bt ) are i.i.d., respectively, for the
same prediction i ∈ A. In this setting we also assume that the feedback and reward sequences of different predictions are independent of each other. Let
µi = E [rt (i)] denote the expected reward of predicting i, µ∗ = maxi∈A µi the optimal reward and i∗
= µ∗ the optimal prediction. Moreover, let
with µi∗ P
Ti (n) = nt=1 I {at = i} denote the number of times i
is predicted by the end of time instant n. Then, defining the “gaps” ∆i = µ∗ − µi for all i ∈ A, the expected
regret of the forecaster becomes

Similarly to the adversarial setting, we build on a base
algorithm Base for the non-delayed case. The advantage in the IPM setting (and that we consider expected
regret) is that here Base can consider a permuted order of rewards and feedbacks, and so we do not have
to wait for the actual feedback; it is enough to receive
a feedback for the same prediction. This is the idea at
the core of our algorithm, Queued Partial Monitoring
with Delayed Feedback (QPM-D):
Algorithm 2 Queued Partial Monitoring with Delays
(QPM-D)
Create an empty FIFO buffer Q[i] for each i ∈ A.
Let I be the first prediction of Base.
for each time instant t = 1, 2, . . . , n do
Predict:
while Q[I] is not empty do
Update Base with a feedback from Q[I].
Let I be the next prediction of Base.
end while
There are no buffered feedbacks for I, so predict
at = I at time instant t to get a feedback.
Update:
for each (s, hs ) ∈ Ht do
Add the feedback hs to the buffer Q[as ].
end for
end for
Here we have a Base partial monitoring algorithm
for the non-delayed case, which is run inside the algorithm. The feedback information coming from the
environment is stored in separate queues for each prediction value. The outer algorithm constantly queries
Base: while feedbacks for the predictions made are
available in the queues, only the inner algorithm Base
runs (that is, this happens within a single time instant

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

in the real prediction problem). When no feedback is
available, the outer algorithm keeps sending the same
prediction to the real environment until a feedback for
that prediction arrives. In this way Base is run in a
simulated non-delayed environment. The next lemma
implies that the inner algorithm Base actually runs in
a non-delayed version of the problem, as it experiences
the same distributions:
Lemma 4. Consider a delayed stochastic IPM problem as defined above. For any prediction i, for any
s ∈ N let h′i,s denote the sth feedback QPM-D receives
for predicting i. Then the sequence (h′i,s )s∈N is an i.i.d.
sequence with the same distribution as the sequence of
feedbacks (ht,i )t∈N for prediction i.
To relate the non-delayed performance of Base and
the regret of QPM-D, we need a few definitions. For
any t, let Si (t) denote the number of feedbacks for
prediction i that are received by the end of time instant t. Then the number of missing feedbacks for i
when making a prediction at time instant t is Gi,t =
Ti (t − 1) − Si (t − 1). Let G∗i,n = max1≤t≤n Gi,t . Furthermore, for each i ∈ A, let Ti′ (t′ ) be the number
of times algorithm Base has predicted i while being
queried t′ times. Let n′ denote the number of steps
the inner algorithm Base makes in n steps of the real
IPM problem. Next we relate n and n′ , as well as the
number of times QPM-D and Base (in its simulated
environment) make a specific prediction.
Lemma 5. Suppose QPM-D is run for n ≥ 1 time
instants, and has queried Base n′ times. Then n′ ≤ n
and
0 ≤ Ti (n) − Ti′ (n′ ) ≤ G∗i,n .

Proof. Since Base can take at most one step for each
feedback that arrives, and QPM-D has to make at least
one step for each arriving feedback, n′ ≤ n.
Now, fix a prediction i ∈ A. If Base, and hence,
QPM-D, has not predicted i by time instant n, (3)
trivially holds. Otherwise, let tn,i denote the last time
instant (up to time n) when QPM-D predicts i. Then
Ti (n) = Ti (tn,i ) = Ti (tn,i − 1) + 1. Suppose Base
has been queried n′′ ≤ n times by time instant tn,i
(inclusive). At this time instant, the buffer Q[i] must
be empty and Base must be predicting i, otherwise
QPM-D would not predict i in the real environment.
This means that all the Si (tn,i −1) feedbacks that have
arrived before this time instant have been fed to the
base algorithm, which has also made an extra step,
that is, Ti′ (n′ ) ≥ Ti′ (n′′ ) = Si (tn,i − 1) + 1. Therefore,
Ti (n) − Ti′ (n′ ) ≤ Ti (tn,i − 1) + 1 − (Si (tn,i − 1) + 1)
≤ Gi,tn,i ≤ G∗i,n .

We can now give an upper bound on the expected regret of Algorithm 2.

environment. Then the expected regret of QPM-D is
upper-bounded by

where E RnBase is the expected regret of Base when
run in the same environment without delays.
When the delay τt is bounded by τmax
 forall t, we also
have G∗i,n ≤ τmax , and E [Rn ] ≤ E RnBase + O(τmax ).
When the sequence of delays for each prediction is
i.i.d. with a finite expected value but unbounded support, we can use Lemma 2 to bound G∗i,n , and obtain
p

a bound E RnBase + O(E [τ1 ] + E [τ1 ] log n + log n).

Proof. Assume that QPM-D is run longer so that
Base is queried for n times (i.e., it is queried n − n′
more times). Then, since n′ ≤ n, the number of times
i is predicted by the base algorithm, namely Ti′ (n), can
only increase, that is, Ti′ (n′ ) ≤ Ti′ (n). Combining this
with the expectation of (3) gives

As shown in Lemma 4, the reordered rewards and feedbacks h′i,1 , h′i,2 , . . . , h′i,T ′ (n′ ) , . . . h′i,Ti (n) are i.i.d. with
i
the same distribution as the original feedback sequence
(ht,i )t∈N . The base algorithm Base has worked on the
first Ti′ (n) of these feedbacks for each i (in its extended
run), and has therefore operated for n steps in a simulated environment with the same reward and feedback
distributions, but without delay. Hence, the first

 summation in the right hand side of (5) is in fact E RnBase ,
the expected regret of the base algorithm in a nondelayed environment. This concludes the proof.

4. UCB for the Multi-Armed Bandit
Problem with Delayed Feedback
While the algorithms in the previous section provide
an easy way to convert algorithms devised for the nondelayed case to ones that can handle delays in the feedback, improvements can be achieved if one makes modifications inside the existing non-delayed algorithms

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

while retaining their theoretical guarantees. This can
be viewed as a ”white-box” approach to extending online learning algorithms to the delayed setting, and
enables us to escape the high memory requirements
of black-box algorithms that arises for both of our
methods in the previous section when the delays are
large. We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit
problem, and extend the UCB family of algorithms
(Auer et al., 2002; Garivier & Cappé, 2011) to the delayed setting. The modification proposed is quite natural, and the common characteristics of UCB-type algorithms enable a unified way of extending their performance guarantees to the delayed setting (up to an
additive penalty due to delays).

2002) uses UCBs of the form Bi,s,t = µ̂i,s +
p
Ps
2 log(t)/s, where µ̂i,s = 1s t=1 h′i,t is the average
of the first s observed rewards. Using this UCB in
our decision rule (6), we can bound the regret of the
resulting algorithm (called Delayed-UCB1) in the delayed setting:

Recall that in the stochastic MAB setting, which is a
special case of the stochastic IPM problem of Section
3.2, the feedback at time instant t is ht = r(at , bt ), and
there is a distribution νi from which the rewards of
each prediction i are drawn in an i.i.d. manner. Here
we assume that the rewards of different predictions are
independent of each other. We use the same notation
as in Section 3.2.

Note that the last term in the bound is the additive penalty, and, under different assumptions, it can
be bounded in the same way as after Theorem 6.
The proof of this theorem, as well as a similar regret bound for the delayed version of the KL-UCB
algorithm (Garivier & Cappé, 2011) can be found in
Appendix B.

Several algorithms devised for the non-delayed
stochastic MAB problem are based on upper confidence bounds (UCBs), which are optimistic estimates
of the expected reward of different predictions. Different UCB-type algorithms use different upper confidence bounds, and choose, at each time instant, a
prediction with the largest UCB. Let Bi,s,t denote the
UCB for prediction i at time instant t, where s is the
number of reward samples used in computing the estimate. In a non-delayed setting, the prediction of
a UCB-type algorithm at time instant t is given by
at = argmaxi∈A Bi,Ti (t−1),t . In the presence of delays,
one can simply use the same upper confidence bounds
only with the rewards that are observed, and predict

5. Conclusion and future work

at = argmaxi∈A Bi,Si (t−1),t

(6)

at time instant t (recall that Si (t − 1) is the number
of rewards that can be observed for prediction i before
time instant t). Note that if the delays are zero, this
algorithm reduces to the corresponding non-delayed
version of the algorithm.
The algorithms defined by (6) can easily be shown to
enjoy the same regret guarantees compared to their
non-delayed versions, up to an additive penalty depending on the delays. This is because the analyses of
the regrets of UCB algorithms follow the same pattern
of upper bounding the number of trials of a suboptimal
prediction using concentration inequalities suitable for
the specific form of UCBs they use.
As an example, the UCB1 algorithm (Auer et al.,

We analyzed the effect of feedback delays in online
learning problems. We examined the partial monitoring case (which also covers the full information and the
bandit settings), and provided general algorithms that
transform forecasters devised for the non-delayed case
into ones that handle delayed feedback. It turns out
that the price of delay is a multiplicative increase in the
regret in adversarial problems, and only an additive increase in stochastic problems. While we believe that
these findings are qualitatively correct, we do not have
lower bounds to prove this (matching lower bounds are
available for the full information case only).
It also turns out that the most important quantity
that determines the performance of our algorithms is
G∗n , the maximum number of missing rewards. It is
interesting to note that G∗n is the maximum number
of servers used in a multi-server queuing system with
infinitely many servers and deterministic arrival times.
It is also the maximum deviation of a certain type of
Markov chain. While we have not found any immediately applicable results in these fields, we think that
applying techniques from these areas could lead to an
improved understanding of G∗n , and hence an improved
analysis of online learning under delayed feedback.

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

A. Proof of Lemma 4
In this appendix we prove Lemma 4 that was used in the i.i.d. partial monitoring setting (Section 3.2). To that
end, we will first need two other lemmas. The first lemma shows that the i.i.d. property of a sequence of random
variables is preserved under an independent random reordering of that sequence.
Lemma 8. Let (Xt )t∈N , be a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. If we reorder
this sequence according to an independent random permutation, then the resulting sequence is i.i.d. with the
same distribution as (Xt )t∈N .
Proof. Let the reordered sequence be denoted by (Zt )t∈N . It is sufficient to show that for all n ∈ N, for all
y1 , y2 , . . . , yn , we have
P {Z1 ≤ y1 , Z2 ≤ y2 , . . . , Zn ≤ yn } = P {X1 ≤ y1 , X2 ≤ y2 , . . . , Xn ≤ yn } .
Since (Xt )t∈N is i.i.d., for any fixed permutation the equation above holds as both sides are equal to
Πnt=1 P {X1 ≤ yt }. Since the permutations are independent of the sequence (Xt )t∈N , using the law of total
probability this extends to the general case as well.
We also need the following result (Doob, 1953, Page 145, Chapter III, Theorem 5.2).
Lemma 9. Let (Xt )t∈N be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, and (Xt′ )t∈N be a subsequence of it such that
the decision whether to include Xt in the subsequence is independent of future values in the sequence, i.e., of Xs
for s ≥ t. Then the sequence (Xt′ )t∈N is an i.i.d. sequence with the same distribution as (Xt )t∈N .
We can now proceed to the proof of Lemma 4.
Proof of Lemma 4. Let (Zi,t )t∈N be the sequence resulting from sorting the variables hi,t by their possible observation times t + τi,t (that is, Zi,1 is the earliest feedback that can be observed if i is predicted at the appropriate
time, and so on). Since delays are independent of the outcomes, they define an independent reordering on the
sequence of feedbacks. Hence, by Lemma 8, (Zi,t )t∈N is an i.i.d. sequence with the same distribution as (hi,t )t∈N .
Note that (h′i,s )s∈N , the sequence of feedbacks (sorted by their observation times) that the agent observes for
predicting i, is a subsequence of (Zi,t )t∈N where the decision whether to include each Zi,t in the subsequence
cannot depend on future possible observations Zi,t′ , t′ ≥ t. Also, the feedbacks of other predictions that are used
in this decision were assumed to be independent of (Zi,t )t∈N . Hence, by Lemma 9, (h′i,s )s∈N is an i.i.d. sequence
with the same distribution as (Zi,t )t∈N , which in turn has the same distribution as (hi,t )t∈N .

B. UCB for the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem with Delayed Feedback
This appendix details the framework we described in Section 4 for analyzing UCB-type algorithms in the delayed
settings, and provides the missing proofs. The regret of a UCB algorithm is usually analyzed by upper bounding
the (expected) number of times a suboptimal prediction is made, and then using Equation (2) to get an expected
regret bound. Consider a UCB algorithm with upper confidence bounds Bi,s,t , and fix a suboptimal prediction
i. The typical analysis (e.g., by Auer et al. (2002)) considers the case when this prediction is made for at
least ℓ > 1 times (for a large enough ℓ), and uses concentration inequalities suitable for the specific form of
the upper-confidence bound to show that it is unlikely to make this suboptimal prediction more than ℓ times
because observing ℓ samples from its reward distribution suffices to distinguish it from the optimal prediction
with high confidence. This value ℓ thus gives an upper bound on the expected number of times i is predicted.
Examples of such concentration inequalities include Hoeffding’s inequality (Hoeffding, 1963) and Theorem 10 of
Garivier & Cappé (2011), which are used for the UCB1 and KL-UCB algorithms, respectively.
More precisely, the generalPanalysis of UCB-type algorithms in the non-delayed setting works as follows: for
n
ℓ > 1, we have Ti (n) ≤ ℓ + t=1 I {at = i, Ti (t) > ℓ}, where the sum on the right hand side captures how much
larger than ℓ the value of Ti (n) is (recall that Ti (t) is the number of times i is predicted up to and including time
t). Whenever i is predicted, its UCB, Bi,Ti (t−1),t , must have been greater than that of an optimal prediction,

(7)

The expected value of the summation on the right-hand-side is then bounded using concentration inequalities as
mentioned above.
In the delayed-feedback setting, if we use upper confidence bounds Bi,Si (t−1),t instead (where Si (t) was defined
to be the number of rewards observed up to and including time instant t), in the same way as above we can write
Ti (n) ≤ ℓ +

I{Bi,Si (t−1),t ≥ Bi∗ ,Si∗ (t−1),t , at = i, Ti (t − 1) ≥ ℓ}.

Ti (n) ≤ ℓ′ + G∗i,n +

I{Bi,Si (t−1),t ≥ Bi∗ ,Si∗ (t−1),t , at = i, Si (t − 1) ≥ ℓ′ }.

Now the same concentration inequalities used to bound (7) in the analysis of the non-delayed setting can be used
to upper bound the expected value of the sum in (8). Putting this into (2), we see that one can reuse the same
upper confidence bound in the delayed setting (with only the observed rewards) and get a performance similar
to the non-delayed setting, with only an additive penalty that depends on the delays. The following two sections
demonstrate the use of this method on two UCB-type algorithms.
B.1. UCB1 under delayed feedback: Proof of Theorem 7
Below comes the proof of Theorem 7 for the Delayed-UCB1 algorithm (Section 4).
Proof of Theorem 7. Following the outline of the previous section, we can bound the summation in (8) using the
same analysis as in the original UCB1 paper (Auer et al., 2002). In particular, for any prediction i we can write

B.2. KL-UCB under delayed feedback
The KL-UCB algorithm was introduced by Garivier & Cappé (2011). The upper confidence bound used by
KL-UCB for predicting i at time t is Bi,Ti (t−1),t , where Bi,s,t is
max {q ∈ [µ̂i,s , 1] : sd(µ̂i,s , q) ≤ log t + 3 log(log t)} ,
with d(p, q) = p log( pq ) + (1 − p) log( 1−p
1−q ) the KL-divergence of two Bernoulli random variables with parameters
p and q. In their Theorem 2, Garivier & Cappé (2011) show that there exists a constant C1 ≤ 10, as well as
functions 0 ≤ C2 (ǫ) = O(ǫ−2 ) and 0 ≤ β(ǫ) = O(ǫ2 ), such that for any ǫ > 0, the expected regret of the KL-UCB
algorithm (in the non-delayed setting) satisfies

Using this upper confidence bound with (6), we arrive at the Delayed-KL-UCB algorithm. For this algorithm, we

used by Garivier & Cappé (2011), again obtaining an additive penalty compared to the non-delayed setting.

Online Learning under Delayed Feedback

In this case, working out the proof and reusing the analysis is somewhat more complicated compared to UCB1.
In particular, we will need an adaptation of Lemma 7 of Garivier & Cappé (2011), which is captured by the
following lemma.
Lemma 11. Let d+ (x, y) = d(x, y)I {x < y}. Then for any n ≥ 1,

t=1

s=ℓ′

Proof of Lemma 11. We start in the same way as the original proof. Note that d+ (p, q) is non-decreasing in its
second parameter, and that at = i and µi∗ ≤ Bi∗ ,Si∗ (t−1),t together imply Bi,Si (t−1),t ≥ Bi∗ ,Si∗ (t−1),t ≥ µi∗ ,
which in turn gives
Si (t − 1)d+ (µ̂i,Si (t−1) , µi∗ ) ≤ Si (t − 1)d(µ̂i,Si (t−1) , Bi,Si (t−1),t ) ≤ log(t) + 3 log(log(t)).

But note that the second summation is bounded by G∗i,n , because for each s, there cannot be more than G∗i,n

would have Ti (t′ − 1) − Si (t′ − 1) = Gi,t′ > G∗i,n , which is not possible. Substituting this bound in the last
expression proves the lemma.
We also recall the following two results from the original paper.
Theorem 12 (Theorem 10 of Garivier & Cappé (2011)). Let (Yt ), t ≥ 1 be a sequence of independent random
variables bounded in [0, 1], with common expectation µ = E [Yt ]. Consider a sequence (ǫt ), t ≥ 1 of Bernoulli

Now, we are ready to prove Theorem 10 by reusing the same techniques as in the original paper.
Proof of Theorem 10. For a suboptimal prediction i, bounding the terms in (8) gives

where the last term is a result of the delays being independent of the rewards. The first summation can be
bounded using Theorem 12, for which it suffices to set ǫt = 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ n, and use the sequence of observed
rewards (h′i,t ) for the arm under consideration as the sequence (Yt ) in the theorem. In the same way as the
analysis of Garivier & Cappé (2011), this gives an upper bound of the form C1′ log(log n) with the same value
of C1′ ≤ 7 as in the non-delayed setting. The second summation can be bounded by Lemma 13. Therefore, the
expected number of times a suboptimal prediction is made is bounded by:

E [Ti (n)] ≤
d(µi , µi∗ )

Combining this with (2) and letting C1 = C1′ + 3 finishes the proof.
