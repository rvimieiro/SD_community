1996).

One alternative for learning PI models is to

use multi-link lookahead search (Xiang et a!.

1997),

PSEUDO-INDEPENDENT MODELS

(a) Structure define<! by
given PI model

It has been shown (Xiang et a!. 1997) that there exists
a class of probability domain models where proper sub­
sets of a set of collectively dependent variables display
marginal independence. Examples of PI models are
parity problems and Modulus addition problems (Xi­
ang 1996). Several algorithms for learning belief net­
works have been shown being unable to learn correctly
when the underlying domain model is a PI model. A
simple PI model with four variables is shown in Ta­
ble 1. More examples can be found in (Xiang et a!.
1996).

It can be verified that X1 and X4 are condition­
ally independent given X2 and X3. In the sub­
set {X2, X3,X4}, each pair is marginally dependent,
e.g., P(X2, X3) # P(X2)P(X3), and is still depen­
dent given the third, e.g., P(X2IX3,X4) 'I P(X2IX4).
However, a special dependence relationship exists
in the subset {X1,X2,X3}. Although each pair is
dependent given the third, e.g., P(XdX2, X3) 'f:.
P(XtiX2), X1 and X2 are marginally independent,
i.e., P(X�o X2) = P(Xl)P(X2), so are Xt and X3.
{X1,X2,X3} are said to be pairwise independent but
collectively dependent. They form an embedded PI
submodel. The minimal I-map of this model is shown
in Figure 1 (a).
Suppose learning starts with an empty graph or struc­
ture (with all nodes but without any link). A single
link lookahead search will not connect X1 and X2 since
the two variables are marginally independent. Nei­
ther will X1 and X3 be connected. This results in the
learned DMN structure in Figure 1 (b), which is incor­
rect. On the other hand, if we perform a double link
search after the single-link search, which can effectively
test whether P(X1IX2,X3) = P(XtiX2) holds, then
the answer will be negative and the two links (Xt, X2)

A MULTI-LINK LOOKAHEAD
SEARCH ALGORITHM

As our parallel learning algorithm is developed based
on a multi-link lookahead search algorithm (Xiang et
al. 1997), the latter is briefly introduced below.
Algorithm

return G;
end

The search is structured into levels and the number
of lookahead links is identical in the same level. Each
level consists of multiple passes. Each pass at the same
level tries to add the same number i of links, that is, al­
ternative structures that differ from the current struc­
ture by i links are evaluated. For instance, level one
search adds a single link in each pass, level two search
adds two links, and so on. Search at each pass selects
i links that decrease the cross entropy maximally after
testing all distinct and legal combinations of i links.
If the corresponding entropy decrement is significant
enough, the i links will be adopted and search contin­
ues at the same level. Otherwise, the next higher level
of search starts.
Note that each intermediate graph is chordal as indi­
cated by the if statement in the inner-most loop. The

condition that L is implied by a single clique C means
that all links in L are contained in the subgraph in­
duced by C. This requirement helps to reduce the
search space.

BELIEF NETWORKS

Learning a belief network using a single link lookahead
search requires checking of O(N2) alternative struc­
tures before a link is added. In an m link lookahead
search, O(N2m) structures must be checked before m
links can be added. We view parallel learning as an
alternative to tackle the increased complexity in multi­
link search, as well as to speed up the single link search
when the domain is large.

partitions these graphs into n sets and distributes one
set to each explorer. Each explorer executes Algorithm
(Explorer-1). It checks chordality for each graph re­
ceived and computes the cross entropy decrement dh*
for each valid chordal graph. It then chooses the best
graph a• and reports dh* and a• to manager. Man­
ager collects the reported graphs from all explorers, se­
lects the best, and then starts the next pass of search.

As mentioned earlier, our study is performed in an
environment where processors communicate through
message passing only (vs. shared memory). We par­
tition the processors as follows. One processor is des­
ignated as the search manager and the others are net­
work structure explorers. The manager executes Al­
gorithm (Manager-1). It is responsible for generating

ALGORITHMS

We extend Algorithm (Sequential) to parallel learning
based on the following observation: at each pass of
search, the exploration of alternative structures are
coupled only through the current structure, i.e., given
the current structure, tests of alternative structures
are independent of each other. Hence the tests can be
performed in parallel.

(Explorer-1)

Figure 2 illustrates the parallel learning process with
two explorers and a dataset of four variables u, v, x
and y. Only a single-link search is performed for sim­
plicity. Manager starts with an empty current graph
in (a). It sends six alternative graphs in (b) through
(g) to explorer 1 and 2. Explorer 1 checks graphs in
(b), (c) and (d), selects the one in (b), and reports
to manager. Explorer 2 reports the one in (e) to man­
ager. After collecting the two graphs, manager chooses
the one in (b) as the new current graph. It then sends
graphs in (i) through (m). Repeating the above pro­
cess, manager finally gets the graph in (n) and sends
graphs in (o) and (p) to all explorers. Since none of
them decreases the cross entropy significantly, man­
ager chooses the graph in (n) as the final result and
terminates explorers.

LOAD BALANCING

3.2.1

3.2.2

The Need of Load Balancing

Balancing load among processors is critical to the ef­
ficiency of parallel learning. In Algorithm {Manager­
l), alternative graphs are evenly allocated to explor­
ers. However, the amount of computation in checking
each graph tends to switch between two extremes. If a
graph is non-chordal, it is ignored immediately with­
out having to compute the cross entropy decrement.
For example, suppose the current graph is shown in
Figure 3 (a). There are six graphs that differ from it
by only one link. If any of the dotted links in (b) is
added to (a), the resultant graph is non-chordal. Since
the complexity of checking chordality is O(INI +lEI),
where N is the number of variables and E is the
number of edges in the graph, the amount of com­
putation is very small. On the other hand, if any of
the dashed links in (c) is added to (a), the resultant
graph is chordal. Since the complexity of comput­
ing cross entropy decrement by local computation is
0( n + 17 ( 7J log 7J + 2'�)) (Xiang et a!. 1997), where n is
the number of cases the dataset and 17 is the maximum
size of the cliques involved, the amount of computa­
tion is much larger. As a result, even job allocation
may require significantly different amount of computa­
tion among explorers. As manager must collect reports
from all explorers before a decision on the new current
graph can be made, some explorers will be idle while
other explorers are completing their jobs.

Two-stage Loading Method

To improve load balancing, we modify Algorithms
(Manager- I) and (Explorer- I) such that jobs are a1lo­
cated in two stages. In the first stage, manager parti­
tions alternative graphs evenly and distributes one set
to each explorer. Each explorer checks the chordal­
ity for each graph received and reports to manager
valid candidates (chordal graphs). Since the amount
of computation for checking chordality is small, this
stage can be completed quickly and the computation
among explorers tends to be even. In the second stage,
manager partitions all received graphs evenly and dis­
tributes one set to each explorer. Each explorer com­
putes cross entropy decrement for each graph received.
It then chooses the best graph c· and reports dh*
and G* to manager. Manager collects the reported
graphs, selects the best, and then starts the next pass
of the search. Since all graphs are chordal in the sec­
ond stage, the degree of load balance mainly depends
on the variability of the sizes of the largest cliques.
3.3

MARGINAL SERVER

During learning, each explorer needs to extract
marginal probabilities (marginals) for cliques from the
dataset. If each processor must extract marginals by
file access each time, the file system will become a bot­
tleneck. One alternative is to compress the dataset and
download one copy at each processor's local memory.
This allows us to handle a dataset up to about 500MB
in our parallel computer. However, when the size of
dataset further increases, more sophisticated methods
are needed.
According to the size of dataset, we partition the avail­
able processors into one manager, n explorers and m
marginal servers. Each server's task is to compute
marginals from the data stored in its local memory
based on the request of explorers. Servers are con­
nected logically into a pipeline indexed from 1 to m.
The dataset is partitioned into m + 1 sets. Each server
stores one distinct set in its local memory. The last set
is duplicated at each explorer's local memory. Algo­
rithms (Manager-1) and (Explorer-1) are modified into
Algorithms (Manager-2), (Explorer-2) and (Server).
The manger executes Algorithm (Manager-2). It per­
forms data distribution as mentioned above. It then
initializes an empty graph and starts the search. It
generates alternative graphs based on the current
graph, partitions into m + n sets and distributes one
set to each explorer and each server. It receives the
valid candidates from explorers and servers, partitions
them into n sets, and send one to each explorer. It
then collects the reported graphs from explorers, se­
lects the best, sends a signal to each server, and starts

Algorithm

Each server executes Algorithm (Server). It does the
same as an explorer for checking chordality. It then
processes requests from explorers until a signal is re­
ceived to start the next pass of search. After rec eiving
a set of nodes (variables) from an explorer, it computes
the sub-marginal using its local data, sums with the
sub-marginal from its preceding server, and passes the
sum to the next server or the requesting explorer.

Since each server has to serve n ex plorers , the pro­
cessing of each server must be n times as fast as an
explorer. This means nTm = Te, where Tm and Te are
the computing time of each marginal server and each
explorer, respectively. Let IDml (IDel) be the size of
local data at a s erv er (explorer). Tm and Te can be
expressed as Tm = kdiDm I and Te :::: kgN + kdiDel,
where kd and kg are coefficients, N is the total number
of variables in the domain, and k9N is the computa­
tion time to get the subgraph for computing the cross
entropy decrement. Therefore, we have

CONFIGURATION

T he previous algorithms are implemented on an
ALEX AVX Series 2 parallel computer with a MIMD
distributed-memory architecture. It has 64 40M Hz
processors each with 32 MB local memory and can be
directly linked to at most four others. Communication
among processors are through message passing at 10
Mbps for simplex and 20 Mbps for duplex communi­
cation.
Message passing time increases as the number of links
between the communicating processors and the length
of the message. Table 2 shows the relation of the mes­
sage passing time with the message length and the
number of links between the communicating proces­
sors. It is important to link the processors such that
the number oflinks involved in each message passing is
minimized. Since each processor has up to four links
and communication is to be performed among man­
ager, explorers and servers, candidate topologies are a
2D mesh and a ternary tree.

Our experiments are intended to check the correctness
of the parallel algorithms and the speed up through
parallelism.
A network structure learned from a dataset generated
from the Alarm network (Beinlich et a!. 1989) is shown
in Figure 6. The result obtained using the parallel
algorithms is identical with that obtained using the
sequential algorithm.

9260 seconds using 2 processors, 8512 seconds using 3
processors, and 8706 seconds using 4 processors. The
speed-up is very small as the number of processors
increases and the efficiency is very low. The speed-up
with four processors was even lower than with three
processors. This appears to be due to the bottleneck in
file access and the corresponding increase in overhead.
The result suggests that the file access method should
be avoided due to the extensive data access needed
during learning.
When the entire dataset can be loaded into the local
memory (about 20 MB is available in our environ­
ment) of each processor, loading the dataset to the
memory is performed once for all and each marginal
can be extracted directly from the memory. We refers
to this as the memory access method. We conducted a
comparison between even job allocation and two-stage
job allocation using the memory access method.

Next, we present the performance result. The perfor­
mance of a parallel program are commonly measured
by speed-up (S) and efficiency (E). Given a particular
task, let T(l) be the execution time of a sequential
program and T(W) be that of a parallel program with
W processors. The two measurements are defined as
S = T(l)/T(W) and E = SjW.
In practice, the performance of a parallel program is
affected by many factors. For our learning problem,
the size of the input data is not trivial. Hence how
the dataset is accessed by processors affects the per­
formance significantly. Our experiments were intended
to test the learning program using different data access
methods. We also tested different job allocation meth­
ods which also affect the performance significantly.
For efficient I/0 and storage, the original dataset of
cases are converted into a compressed frequency table
where the value of each variable is represented by one
byte. This file is used as the input to the learning
program. In the parallel computer we used, file access
by all processors must be performed through a special
processor. The simplest way for a learning program
to extract marginals from the data is to access the file
directly for each marginal. This file access method was
tested using a dataset of 10000 cases generated from
the ALARM network.
The sequential program (one processor) learned the

The experiment used a dataset of 10000 cases gener­
ated from the ALARM network. The result is shown
in Table 3. Each row is the result obtained by using
n explorers as indicated in the first column. Columns
2 through 4 present the result obtained with even job
allocation and columns 5 through 7 present the result
obtained with two-stage job allocation.
Columns 3 and 6 show that as the number of explor­
ers increases, the speed-up increases as well with either
job allocation method. It demonstrates that our paral­
lel algorithm can effectively reduce the learning time.
This provides positive evidence that parallelism is an
alternative to tackle the computational complexity in
learning large belief networks.
Comparing column 3 with 6 and column 4 with 7,
it can be seen that the two-stage allocation further
speeds up the learning process and improves the effi­
ciency compared with even job allocation. For exam­
ple, when eight explorers are used, the speed-up is 5.66

creased computational complexity in learning PI mod­
els.

The result also shows a gradual decrease in efficiency
as the number of explorers increases. This efficiency
decrease is mainly due to the job allocation overhead.
Manager must allocate job to each explorer sequen­
tially at the beginning of each search step. Therefore,
each explorer is idle after its report in the previous
search step is submitted and before the next job is
assigned to it.

When the size of dataset is beyond the available lo­
cal memory of each processor, we suggest the use of
marginal servers. Comparison of using different num­
ber of servers was performed in learning ALARM net­
work. Figure 8 shows the speed-up comparison and
Figure 9 shows the efficiency comparison. The verti­
cal axis is labelled by S for speed-up or E for efficiency.
The horizontal axis is labelled by W = m + n, where
m is the number of marginal servers and n is the num­
ber of explorers. De is the size of data stored in the
local memory of each explorer, and Dm is that of each
server. The speed up is calculated using sequential
learning with file access as this is considered the alter­
native when marginal server is not used.

The second row shows the computation time in sequen­
tial learning. It increases from PIM 1 to PIM4. This
is because the increased size of the domain for PIM 1
through P IM 3 (26, 30, 3 5 variables) and the increased
size of the dataset (20000, 25000, 30000). PIM4 used
the most computation time because it has a PI sub­
model of 4 variables, which requires six-link lookahead
search.
For all models, the speed-up increases as more explor­
ers are employed. On the other hand, when more ex­
plorers are used, PIM1 has the fastest decrease in ef­
ficiency and PIM4 has the slowest decrease with the
other two models in-between. This is highly correlated
with the increase of computation time from PIM 1 to
PIM4. This is because as the search space becomes
larger, the number of alternative graphs to be explored
in each job allocation becomes larger. The conse­
quence is that the message passing overhead becomes
less significant compared with the search time and
hence the efficiency improves. This result shows that
parallel learning are quite suited for tackling the in-

tion time, speed up or efficiency as indicated by the

REMARKS

We have studied parallelism in learning to tackle the
increased computational complexity in learning belief
networks in difficult domains (PI models) as well as in
learning from large domains. Parallel algorithms were
proposed that decompose the learning task such that
multiple processors can be used without incurring ad­
ditional error. In order to improve the efficiency of the
parallel system, we proposed a two-stage job allocation
method to handle the variation in computation time
in searching different candidate networks. In order to
overcome the bottleneck by file access, we proposed
the parallel learning algorithm using marginal servers.
This allows fast memory access of data when the size
of the dataset is much larger than the local memory of
each processor.
The parallel learning algorithms are implemented on
an AVX Series 2 parallel computer with a MIMD
distributed-memory architecture. Our experimental
result showed that parallel learning can effectively
speed up learning PI models as well as learning non-PI
models in large domains.
