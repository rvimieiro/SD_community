Abstract
Sampling is an important tool for estimating
large, complex sums and integrals over high­
dimensional spaces. For instance, importance
sampling has been used as an alternative to exact
methods for inference in belief networks. Ideally,
we want to have a sampling distribution that pro­
vides optimal-variance estimators. In this paper,
we present methods that improve the sampling
distribution by systematically adapting it as we
obtain information from the samples. We present
a stochastic-gradient-descent method for sequen­
tially updating the sampling distribution based on
the direct minimization of the variance. We also
present other stochastic-gradient-descent meth­
ods based on the minimization of typical notions
of distance between the current sampling distri­
bution and approximations of the target, optimal
distribution. We finally validate and compare the
different methods empirically by applying them
to the problem of action evaluation in influence
diagrams.

INTRODUCTION

Often, we are interested in computing quantities involving
large sums, such as expectations in uncertain, structured
domains. For instance, belief inference in Bayesian net­
works (BNs) requires that we sum or marginalize over the
remaining variables that are not of interest. Similarly, in
order to solve the problem of action selection in influence
diagrams, we sum over the variables that are not observed
at the time of the decision in order to compute the value of
different action choices.
We can represent the uncertainty in structured environ­
ments using a BN. A BN allows us to compactly define
a joint probability distribution over the relevant variables
in a domain. It provides a graphical representation of the

distribution by means of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
It defines locally a conditional probability distribution for
each relevant variable, represented as a node in the graph,
given the state of its parents in the graph. This decomposi­
tion can help in the evaluation of the sums. However, due
to factors regarding the connectivity of the graph, in gen­
eral this is not sufficient to allow an efficient computation
of the exact value of the sums of interest.
Sampling provides an alternative tool for approximately
computing these sums. Sampling methods have been pro­
posed as an alternative to exact methods for such problems.
In particular, importance sampling (see Geweke [ 1989],
and the references therein) has been applied to the prob­
lem of belief inference in BNs [Fung and Chang, 1989,
Shachter and Peot, 1989] and action selection in IDs (see
Charnes and Shenoy [ 1999] and the references therein,
and Ortiz and Kaelbling [2000]). In its simpler form, the
importance-sampling distribution used is the "prior" dis­
tribution of the BN resulting from setting the value of the
evidence. It has been noted early on that this sampling dis­
tribution is far from optimal in the sense that it provides es­
timates with larger variance than necessary [Shachter and
Peot, 1989]. For instance, the optimal sampling distribu­
tion in the case of belief inference is to sample the unob­
served variables from the posterior distribution over them
given the observed evidence. If we knew this distribution
we would know the answer to the belief inference problem.
Several modifications have been proposed to improve the
estimation of the simple importance sampling distribu­
tion discussed above, based on information obtained from
the samples [Fung and Chang, 1989, Shachter and Peot,
1989, Shwe and Cooper, 199 1]. In this paper, we pro­
pose methods to systematically and sequentially update the
importance-sampling distribution. We view the updating
process as one of learning a separate BN just for sampling.
The learning objective is to minimize some error criterion.
A stochastic-gradient method results from the direct min­
imization of the variance of the estimator with respect to
the importance sampling distribution as an error function.
Other stochastic-gradient methods result from minimizing

error functions based on typical measures of the notion of
distance between the current sampling distribution and ap­
proximations of the optimal sampling distribution.

DEFINITIONS

We begin by introducing some notation used throughout
the paper. We denote one-dimensional random variables
by capital letters and denote multi-dimensional random
variables by bold capital letters. For instance, we de­
note a multi-dimensional random variable by X and de­
note all its components by
where
is the
ith one-dimensional random variable. We use small let­
ters to denote assignments to random variables. For in­
stance, X = x means that for each component
of X,

We denote the set of possible values that
can
take by Ox, and the set of possible values that X can take

nodes in a graph. We denote by
the parents of node
in a directed graph.

We now introduce notation that will become useful dur­
ing the description of the methods presented in this pa­
per.
We denote by the operator Lz the sum over
the possible values of the individual variables forming
Z, Lz Lz . . Lz . For any function h with vari1

abies Z and 0, the expression h(Z,O)lo=o stands for
a function f' over variables Z that results from setting
the values of 0 in h with assignment o while letting
the values for Z remain unassigned. In other words,
f'(Z) = h(Z,O)lo=o = h(Z, 0
o) . The notation
X = (Z, 0) means that the variable X is formed by
all the variables that form Z and 0. That is, X =
(Z,O),

of variables forming Z and those forming 0are disjoint.

A Bayesian network (BN) is a graphical probabilistic model
used to represent uncertainty in structured domains. It com­
pactly represents the joint probability distribution over the
relevant variables of the system of interest. It uses a di­
rected acyclic graph (DAG) to represent the relationship
between the relevant variables. A node in the graph rep­
resents a variable. The model defines a local conditional
distribution
for each node or variable
I
given its parents
in the graph. The joint distribution
is then

P(Xi Pa(Xi))
Pa(Xi)

For instance, we can define a BN on the graph given in
Figure l (a).
The inference problem in BNs is that of computing the pos­
terior probability of an assignment to a subset of variables

ence diagram.
given evidence about another subset of variables in the sys­
tem. Assume that the variables are discrete and their sam­
ple spaces or the possible values each variable can take are
finite. In general, let X = (Z, 0) where 0 is the set of
variables of interest, o is an assignment to it and Z are the
remaining variables. For this problem we want to compute
probabilities of the kind

P(O

= o

)

=

LzP(Z,O = o ) .

Often, the local decomposition of the joint distribution still
leads to the evaluation of sums over a large number of
variables. In general, this problem is intractable [Cooper,
1990].
An influence diagram (ID) is a probabilistic model for
decision-making under uncertainty. We can think of an ID
as a BN with decision and utility nodes added. For instance,
we can use our example BN to build an ID as shown in Fig­
ure 1(b). The square is a decision node. The diamond is a
utility node. We now have potentially different joint distri­
butions over the variables, for each action choice available.
Assume for simplicity that there is a single decision node
in the graph. The joint distribution over the variables, given
the action choice aassigned to the decision variable, is

P(X I A= a) =

TI�=l P(Xi I Pa(Xi))IA=a

·

The decision associated with a decision node is a function
of its parent nodes in the graph. We will have access to

448

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

the value of these variables at the time of making the deci­
sion. Similarly, the utility associated with a utility node is
a function of its parent nodes in the graph.
Assume that we have a finite number of discrete action
choices. Then, one problem is to select the best strategy or
function 7r* mapping each possible value of the parents of
the decision node to an action choice. The best strategy is
the strategy with highest expected utility. Let X = (Z, 0)
where the variables in 0are parents of the decision node
and Z are the remaining variables. The problem of ob­
taining an optimal strategy reduces to obtaining, for each
assignment 0 = o, the action that maximizes the value
associated with the action and the assignment:

V0(a) =I::z P(Z , 0= o I A= a) U(Z , 0=o, A= a) .
Note once again that computing this value requires the eval­
uation of a sum. For the same reasons as in the previous
problem of belief inference in BNs, the exact computation
of this value is intractable in general.

to it the value given by the evidence assignment o. There­
fore, the resulting samples will be assignments to those
variables that are not in the evidence set according to the
"prior" distribution of the BN. We call the method resulting
from this importance-sampling distribution the traditional
method. In the context of belief inference, this method is
called likelihood-weighting (LW) since the weight function
is a "likelihood" and thus each sample is weighted by its
"likelihood."
We can similarly apply this technique in the context of ac­
tion selection in IDs to evaluate V0 (a) . In general, we let

Note that we are defining the importance sampling distri­
bution to be the "prior" distribution of the BN. We obtain
samples from this distribution by sampling the variables
in the (partial) order defined by the DAG and according
to the local conditional distribution of the original BN for
each variable. As we obtain samples from each variable by
traversing the nodes in the graph and sampling the variable
corresponding to it, if we get to a node or variable that is in
the evidence set 0, we do not sample it. Instead, we assign

In particular, for our example,

IMPORTANCE SAMPLING

Importance sampling provides an alternative to the exact
methods for evaluating sums. Let the quantity of inter­
est be G = I::z g( Z) for some real function g. We
can turn the sum into an expectation by expressing G =
I::z f(Z) (g(Z)/ f(Z)), where f is a probability distribu­
tion over Z satisfying, for all Z, g(Z) =f 0 =? f(Z) =f 0.
We call f the importance-sampling distribution. We de­
fine the weight function w(Z) = g(Z)/ f(Z) which al­
lows us to express G
I::z f(Z)w(Z). Hence, we can
obtain an unbiased estimate of G by obtaining N samples
z<1l, . .. , z(N) from Z "' f and computing the estimate

An important property of the estimator G is the variance of
the weights associated with the importance-sampling dis­
tribution. This is

Var[w(Z ) ] = I::z f(Z)w(Z)2- G 2•
Recall that G = I::z g(Z) by definition and assume that
g is a positive function. From this we can derive that the
optimal or minimum-variance importance-sampling distri­
bution is proportional to g(Z):

f*(Z) = g(Z)/ I::z g(Z).

(2)

The weights will have zero variance in that case, since the
weight function will always output our value of interest
G. We also note that we need to avoid letting f(Z) be
too small with respect to g(Z), since this will increase
the variance. As a matter of fact, Var[w(Z ) ] --+ oo as
f(Z) --+ 0 for at least one value of Z. This implies that
we should use importance-sampling distributions with suf­
ficiently "fat tails."

ADAPTIVE IMPORTANCE SAMPLING

The traditional method presented above uses as the
importance-sampling distribution the "prior" distribution

449

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

of the BN which can be far from optimal in the sense that
it can have higher variance than necessary. In the case of
evaluating actions in IDs, it also completely ignores poten­
tially useful information about the utility values. Therefore,
we try to learn the optimal importance-sampling distribu­
tion by adapting the current sampling distribution as we
obtain samples from it.
We view the adaptive process as one of learning a distribu­
tion over the variables the sum is over to use specifically as
an importance-sampling distribution. In particular, we can
view this process as learning BNs from the samples just for
sampling. From the expression of the optimal importance­
sampling distribution given in equation 2 (and, in particu­
lar, from the factorization of the function g for the different
estimation problems), we can deduce that in order to be
able to represent this distribution graphically using a BN
we need to add arcs that connect every pair of nodes that
are parents of observations and/or utility nodes, if they are
not already connected. However, doing so can increase the
size of the model, particularly in cases where the local con­
ditional probabilities and the utilities have a smaller, more
compact parametric representation (i.e., noise-or's). In this
paper, we do not deal with this issue and instead concen­
trate on the problem of learning a BN with the same struc­
ture as the original BN (or ID). Hence, we only need to
update the local conditional probability distributions as we
obtain samples.
We can parameterize the importance-sampling distribution
using a set of parameters E>. Let the indicator function
I(Zi k, Pa(Zi) = j I Z) 1 if the condition zi = k
and Pa(Zi) = j agrees with the value assigned to Z; 0
otherwise. Then, we can express the importance-sampling
distribution as

where for each i,j, k, eijk
P(Zi k I Pa(Zi) = j, E>).
Hence, for all i,j, L:k eijk
1, and for all k, eijk > 0.
Note that this representation uses the assumptions of global
and local parameter independence typically used in BNs.
The weight function is also parameterized and defined as

LEARNING CRI TERIA AND UPDATE RULES

In the following subsections we present different methods
for updating the sampling distribution. The update rules
are all based on gradient-descent. Hence, at each time t,
we update the parameters as follows:

(4)
oCt+1) +-oCt)- a(t)\i'Pe(OCt)).
In the update rule above, a(t) denotes the learning rate or
the step size rule and \i'Pe(E>) denotes the gradient of error

function e, appropriately projected to satisfy the constraints
onE>. The methods differ in how they define \i'Pe(oCtl).

In the discussion below we denote the N(t) i.i.d. samples
as zCt,1), ... , zCt,NCt)) drawn according to Z
f (Z I
oCtJ). If we gather samples to estimate G using many dif­
ferent sampling distributions, how can we combine them
to get an unbiased estimate? It is sufficient to weight them
using any weighting function that is independent of the sub­
estimates obtained by using just the samples for one sam­
pling distribution. For instance, the estimator
""

C;CT) = I::'{=1 W(t)G(oCtl),

I::'{=1 W(t) = 1 and W(t) ;:::: 0, for all t, and

is unbiased as long as W(t) and G(oCt)) are independent
for each t. Letting W(t)
1/T will produce an unbi­
where

ased estimate. This is the weight we use in the experi­
ments. In general, we would like to give more weight to
importance-sampling distributions with smaller variances.
Assuming that the variance decreases with t, we would like
W(t) to be an increasing sequence oft. Note that using
W(t) ex 1/ where is the sample variance at time t,
though appealing, does not necessarily lead to an unbiased
estimator since W(t) and G(oCt)) are not independent.

We will consider three general strategies: minimizing vari­
ance directly, minimizing distance to global approxima­
tions of the optimal sampling distribution, and minimizing
distance to the empirical distribution of the optimal sam­
pling distribution based on local approximations. For the
first two strategies, we will find that we can express the
partial derivatives that form the gradient as, for all i,j, k,

Minimizing Variance Directly

As we noted above, the optimal importance-sampling dis­
tribution for estimating G is that which minimizes the
variance of w. Using that as our objective, we derive a
stochastic-gradient update rule for the parameters of the

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

importance-sampling distribution. Let the error function
be

8)2.

eKL2(8) = Ez f(Z I 8) log (f(Z I 8)/ f*(Z)).

The corresponding function for the gradient is

8).

Approximate Global Minimization

Recall the optimal importance-sampling distribution f* for
estimating G given in equation 2. The update rules of the
following subsection are all motivated by the idea of reduc­
ing some notion of distance between the current sampling
distribution and this optimal sampling distribution. Note
that we cannot really compute the values of the optimal dis­
tribution since that requires knowing the normalizing con­
stant Ez g(Z) = G which is exactly the value we want
to estimate. We approximate the optimal distribution using
the current estimate of G as follows
(8)

In the following, we will consider four error functions, one
based on the sum-squared-error and three based on versions
of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

eKL.(8)= ! eKL1(8) + !eKL2(8).
We can obtain the partial derivatives for this error function
and their approximation accordingly.

4.1.3

Heuristic Local Minimization Based on
Empirical Distribution

The update methods in this subsection are motivated by the
idea of minimizing different notions of distance between
the current sampling distribution and an empirical distribu­
tion of the optimal importance-sampling distribution that
we build from the samples. The hope is that the empirical
distribution is a good approximation of the optimal sam­
pling distribution. We define the empirical distribution, pa­
rameterized by 8 locally as follows: for all i, j, k,

z=[':_<;l I(Z;==k,Pa(Z;}==jiZ==z(t,l))w(z<t,l) l9(t))
(t)
Bijk
z=[:<;) I(Pa(Z;)==jiZ==z(t,l))w(z(t,l) 19('))
_

If we use the 12 norm or sum-squared-error function as a
notion of distance between the distributions, then the error
function is

f*(Z)- f(Z I 8)
f(z(t,l} I o<t)) X
(w(z<t,t> 1 o<t>);c<t> - 1\,

(9)

where the approximation results from using ]t(Z) as de­
fined in equation 8 as an approximation to f*(Z).
An alternative, commonly-used notion of distance between
two probability distributions is given by the Kullback­
Leibler (KL) divergence. This measure is not symmetric.
One version of the KL divergence in this context is given
by the error function

eKL1(8) = Ez f*(Z) log (f*(Z)/f(Z I 8)).

is not immediately apparent whether the update rules based

Note also that the magnitude of the components of the re­

If w(Z I

sampling distribution, all the functions

We can interpret the update rules based on local KL­
divergence as adding weights to the elements of the domain
of the importance-sampling distribution and renormalizing.
For the version of KL-divergence with respect to the em­
pirical distribution, we are always adding weights. We add
values relative to the amount we underestimated or over­
estimated the magnitude of the distribution for a particu­
lar state. If we underestimated, we add weights larger than
one. If we overestimated, we add weights smaller than one.
For the other version of KL-divergence, due to the loga­
rithm function, we add weight if we underestimated while
we subtract weight if we overestimated. Therefore, the log­
arithm brings the amount of underestimation and overesti­
mation to the same scale and adds or subtracts weight ac­
cordingly.

RELATED WORK

Different variations of importance sampling have been used
for the problems discussed in this paper (See Lin and
Druzdzel [1999] and the references therein). Our methods
belong to the class of forward samplers since they sam­
ple from a distribution based on the original structure of
the BN. Of these, self-importance sampling [Shachter and
Peot, 1989, Shwe and Cooper, 1991] is the method closest
to the methods proposed in this paper since it also updates
the sampling distribution as it obtains information from the
samples. This method has an update rule that is very sim­
ilar to the one derived for

a weighting between the empirical distribution and the first

Annealed importance sampling [Neal, 1998] is a related
technique in that it tries to obtain samples from the opti­
mal sampling distribution. As we understand it, the user
sets up a sequence of distributions, the last distribution be­
ing the optimal distribution, typically defined by Markov
chains. We move from one distribution to another as we
"anneal" and the sequence converges to the optimal sam­
pling distribution. The hope is that we can get an inde­
pendent sample from that distribution, then we restart the
process to try to obtain another independent sample, and
so on. Finally, it uses those independent samples to obtain
an estimate. Notice that each "traversal" of the sequence
of distributions (or Markov chains) produces a single sam­
ple. The technique is very general and we are unaware of
whether it has been applied to the problems considered in
this paper. We are currently investigating possible connec­
tions between our methods and this technique.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We implemented all of the adaptive importance-sampling
methods described above. We Jet the learning rate a(t) =
(3jt, where (3 is a value that depends on the updating
method. We need different values of (3 for the different
methods because of the differences in magnitude of their
gradients. We impose an additional constraint on the pa­
rameters which we call the €-boundary. We require that for
all i, j, k, Bijk 2: E(IDx,l)
"!/ IDx,l, where"( is a con­
stant factor. In our experiments, we Jet"(
0.1. We do
this so that our sampling distribution has "fat tails", avoid­
ing extrema in probability and hence the possibility of in­
finite variance. We initialize the parameters o<O) such that
the starting importance-sampling distribution is the "prior"
probability distribution of the original BN. However, if one
of the local conditional probability values does not satisfy
the E-boundary constraint, we change the distribution so
that it does.

Note that this is not enough to guarantee that after taking a
step in the projected direction, the parameters will remain
in the constraint space. If, when updating a local condi­
tional probability distribution, its respective parameters do
not satisfy the constraint, we find the minimum step a' that
will allow them to remain inside the constraint space and
take a step of size a' /2 along the gradient direction (i.e.,
half the distance between the current position of the param­
eter we are updating in the simplex and the closest point on
the €-boundary along the gradient direction).
We tested the methods on the computer mouse prob­
lem [Ortiz and Kaelbling, 2000], a simple made-up ID
shown in Figure 2. We added one to all the utility val­
ues presented in Ortiz and Kaelbling [2000] to make g
positive. We will consider the problem of obtaining the
value VMP, (A) for the action A = 2 and the observation

MPt = l.

We evaluated each method by computing the mean­
squared-error (MSE) between the true value of the expec­
tation of interest (VM p, (A)) and the estimate generated us­
ing the adaptive sampling method. The first results show
how the methods achieve better MSEs with fewer samples
for this problem. We only show results for those methods
that were the most competitive. We denote by "Var" the
method based on the minimization of the variance, and by
"L2 " "KL1", and "KLS" the methods based on the global
minimization of 12, KL1 and KLs respectively. For the

account that the update methods have to traverse the graph
once every iteration to update the parameters relevant to the
sample taken. To compensate for this time, we allow the es­
timate based on LW to use twice as many samples. Figure 3
shows the results. The graph shows the average MSE over
40 runs as a function of the total number of samples taken
(times 2 for LW) by the methods. We note that Var and L2
achieve better MSEs than LW and converge to them faster.
With significance level 0.005 we can state (individually)
for each total number of samples N = 50, 150, 250, that
Var and L2 (individually) are better with respect to MSE
than LW. Also, for N = 250, KLS is better than LW.
We also ran the methods with N(t) = 50, including the
local heuristic methods. They were only competitive after
a larger total number of samples (N > 150). Although fur­
ther analysis is necessary, we would like to convey some
general observations. We believe that in general there is a
tradeoff in the setting of N(t) and (3. We note that, of the
updates based on the two KL versions, KLl typically per­
forms better than KL2. We believe this is because the error
function eKL1 is defined with respect to the optimal sam­
pling distribution while eKL2 is with respect to the current
sampling distribution. KLS seems to perform better than
both. L2 is more stable than any of the other methods, sug­
gesting further theoretical analysis which we are currently
undertaking. Several possible reasons for this behavior are
(1) the variance of the gradient might be smaller than in
other cases, (2) the error function is bounded, and/or (3)
the error surface might be smoother than in other cases. We
conjecture that L2 converges to a stationary point of eL2•
The second result shows that the update methods indeed
lead to importance-sampling distributions with smaller
variance relatively quickly for this problem. Figure 4

shows a graph of the true variance of the sampling distribu­
tion learned using the different update methods as a func­
tion of the total number of samples used. The horizontal
line shows the variance associated with the sampling dis­
tribution used by LW (i.e., the "prior" distribution of the
original BN).
These experiments are all carried out on a single prob­
lem. Although they must clearly be extended to a variety
of larger problems, they indicate that adaptive importance­
sampling methods, particularly those that minimize vari­
ance and the 12 norm, can lead to significant improvements
in the efficiency of sampling as a method for computing
large expectations.
