Abstract
We describe an environment that considerably simplifies the process of generating
Bayesian belief networks. The system has been implemented on readily available,
inexpensive hardware, and provides clarity and high performance. We present an
introduction to Bayesian belief networks, discuss algorithms for inference with
these networks, and delineate the classes of problems that can be solved with this
paradigm. We then describe the hardware and software that constitute the system,
and illustrate Ergo's use with several examples.

Introduction
A graphical representation of probabilistic relationships among variables, called a
Bayesian belief network, has been independently defined by several researchers.
There is thus a plethora of synonyms for Bayesian belief networks [Pearl 1987], such
as causal nets [Good 1961a; Good 1961b], probabilistic causal networks [Cooper 1984],
influence diagrams [Howard 1984; Shachter 1986], and causal networks [Lauritzen
1988]. We shall use the term belief network in this paper.
Belief networks provide a conceptual framework for constructing expert systems
[Cooper 1989; Horvitz 1988]; they function as platforms for knowledge acquisition
[Chavez 1989; Beckerman 1989; Lehmann 1988] and for normative probabilistic in­
ference [Lauritzen 1988; Pearl 1986; Suermondt 1988]. This representational power is
particularly helpful when used in complex domains, in which conclusions, inter­
mediate states, and evidence are related by extensive interactions, making knowl­
edge acquisition and knowledge-base maintenance difficult. A belief network clearly
specifies the variables, associations, and probabilities relevant to a particular do­
main, and can thus form the basis for communication and consensus formation
among experts [Bonduelle 1987].
Belief networks are primarily characterized as being used for classification; this class
of problems excludes planning, yet includes many interesting problems, such as
constraint satisfaction, that traditionally have been solved with classical AI meth­
ods. Recent research has shown that any influence diagram used for decision mak­
ing can be transformed to an equivalent belief network [Cooper 1988].
A belief-network is a finite directed acyclic graph in which nodes represent the vari­
ables of interest, and arcs from parent nodes to child nodes represent a probabilistic
association among the child and its parents. Probabilities are attached to nodes and

115

to arcs in a belief network; these probabilities capture the uncertainty inherent to the
relationships among the variables. In particular, for each node Xi with a set of par­
ents 1ri, there is a conditional probability distribution P(xi I 1ri); for each Xi without
parents, there is a prior probability distribution P(xv.
Conditional probabilities in belief networks can be interpreted as "if-then" rules in
the construction of probabilistic expert systems. In this sense, a rule in a belief net­
work is a conditional probability of the form P(Xi I y1,y2, .. ,yn), where Xi and y1,y2, ,yn
are variables with known values. Each variable has an associated set of rules, which
is the collection of conditional probabilities for each possible combination of values
that this variable and its parents can assume.
.

The prior and conditional probabilities explicitly represented in a belief network are
sufficient for computing any probability of the form P(B 14>), where e and 4> are
members of the power set of this belief network's variables. The key feature of the
belief-network paradigm is its explicit characterization of conditional independence
among variables, which in turn decreases the number of probabilities required to
capture the full joint distribution.

Inference Algorithms
The practicality of Bayesian reasoning has been debated in the literature for several
decades [Buchanan 1985, pp. 235-237; Cooper 1989; Rich 1983]. In particular, slow in­
ference times and the need for a large number of probabilities have been cited.
However, several algorithms have been developed during the last ten years that
greatly increase the efficiency of Bayesian inference. They share the additional ad­
vantage of operating directly on the graphical network structure; thus, the same
graph used for knowledge acquisition can be immediately and directly used for vali­
dation of that knowledge, leading to rapid model refinement.
Algorithms for belief-network inference, such as those developed by Pearl [Pearl
1986; Suermondt 1988] and Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [Lauritzen 1988], allow the
user to instantiate values for some nodes, after which these algorithms compute
posterior distributions over the remaining nodes. These methods thus provide a
simple yet general mechanism whereby the user may enter evidence and determine
the ensuing implications.
Pearl's algorithm implements a local message-passing system for probability updates
in singly connected networks. To cope with multiply connected networks, the
method of cutset conditioning has been proposed [Pearl 1988, pp. 204-210] and im­
plemented [Suermondt 1990]. This technique results in a time complexity propor­
tional to the product of the size of the network, the number of cutset instantiations
and (without special scheduling techniques) the size of the evidence set. The num­
ber of cutset instantiations is exponential in the number of undirected cycles, and for
many applications this will result in impractical running times.

The Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter algorithm rearranges the network into a tree by form­
ing clusters of nodes (cliques). The complexity of evidence propagation using this al­
gorithm is linear in the number of cliques, and proportional to the size of the largest
clique in the network. The size of a clique is exponential in the number of nodes in
that clique. As a node always forms a clique with at least its parents, the maximum
number of parents over all nodes in the network is an important determinant of the
running time. In contrast to Pearl's algorithm, observing evidence makes inference
faster by simplifying the tree of cliques.
Approximate algorithms are also being developed [Chavez 1989; Henrion 1988;
Shachter 1989]; they allow the user to trade inference time for precision or accuracy.
As the sizes of implemented problems increase, the use of these algorithms will be­
come more prevalent.

Ergo
Although belief networks provide an intuitive medium for knowledge acquisition
and inference in probabilistic expert systems, graphical tools are required for the cre­
ation and manipulation of any nontrivial network. Ergo provides the necessary en­
vironment for rapid prototyping and implementation of probabilistic expert sys­
tems. Ergo contains: (1) a graph editor, (2) a probability editor, and (3) a numerical
engine.

The Graph Editor
The graph editor provides a drawing environment for manipulating the network
structure (Figure 1). Nodes and edges are created and deleted much as they would be
in a mouse-based drawing program; nodes (along with their corresponding condi­
tional-probability matrices) and arcs may be copied and pasted either within a win-

117

dow or among windows. This facility allows the user to construct networks incre­
mentally; several subnetworks can be developed individually, and then merged into
a larger structure using the copy and paste features. Furthermore, a library of proto­
typical structures could be designed once and then imported as needed, further
modularizing system design and implementation.

The Probability editor
At any time during network construction the user may choose to enter probabilities
for any node or change its characteristics by using the probability-editor (Figure 2).
For each node its name, number of values, and a label for each value is displayed.
Probabilities are edited in a tabular format, and can be pasted from other networks or
other applications (such as spread-sheets or statistical packages).

The Numerical Engine
A node is instantiated by selecting one of its values from a pop-up menu. This evi­
dence can be propagated automatically, or at the user's request after several instanti­
ations. Results for each node are shown either as histograms or as numerical values
in a pop-up menu.
We have implemented an efficient version of the Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter (LS) algo­
rithm. A network is first triangulated using a modified version of maximum cardi­
nality search [Tarjan 1985] that -allows for disconnected graphs. The graph is then
compiled to a tree (or forest) of cliques as described by Pearl [Pearl 1988, p. 113].
Probability updating in the clique tree follows the scheme described by Lauritzen and
Spiegelhalter. Our method of evidence absorption differs from that proposed in
their paper in two respects:

Clique potentials incompatible with new evidence are removed from the cliques
and are not set to zero as proposed by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter. The speed of
the following update step increases for any evidence on a variable with more
than two values. Consider for example a clique with nodes A, B, and C, where
each node has 3 values. This clique has 27 potentials describing its probability dis­
tribution. Now assume that node C is observed to have value c1. All potentials in
the clique (ABC) with values c2 and C3 for Care incompatible with this evidence
and are removed. This step takes at most 27 operations (to check the consistency
of each potential). The resulting clique (AB I C=c1) now has only nine potentials.
During updating, this clique must propagate its values to its parent and later to
its children; the number of steps for propagation is proportional to the number
of potentials in the clique. Assume that this clique has only one child (a clique
can have at most one parent); propagation then requires 2*9 = 18 steps. The total
number of steps involved in updating this clique is 27+18 = 45 steps. In compari­
son, setting clique potentials to zero involves at most 27 steps, but the clique size
remains constant; thus, the update takes a total of 27 + 2* 27 = 81 steps. This ben­
efit increases with the number of children.
The existing clique tree is modified to accommodate new evidence, instead of be­
ing completely rebuilt as Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter suggest. This approach is
similar to the join-tree method described by Jensen et al. [Jensen 1988], and obvi­
ates an initialization step before every update.

Refining the model
After cycling between network construction and evaluation, the user may save the
network to a file, print its structure, or export the graph to any of several Macintosh
drawing or writing programs. In addition, the user may choose to export a text-for­
mat description of the network so that the file can be read by other programs.

119

Using a paradigm of iterative construction and evaluation, a group of users can de­
velop subnetworks in parallel and then merge them in a common window. This
paradigm owes its feasibility to the modularity conferred on belief networks by the
explicit representation of conditional independence.

Performance
We first describe an implementation of the Asia belief network, which was pre­
sented in [Lauritzen 1988], and is shown in our figures. A fictitional piece of qualita­
tive knowledge is considered: Patients might have tuberculosis, lung cancer, or
bronchitis. These diseases might cause a positive finding on a chest X-ray or short­
ness of breath (dyspnea). The prior probabilities of the diseases are influenced by a
history of smoking and a recent visit to Asia.
Using Ergo on a Macintosh II, we drew and specified the network in a few minutes.
Network compilation took less than a second, and resulted in a triangulated graph
identical to the full moral graph in the paper by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter.
Evidence absorption and propagation also was instantaneous.
We further tested Ergo with the ALARM network (see Figure 4), which has been used
to analyze the complexity and behavior of different inference algorithms [Beinlich
1989]. This network contains37 nodes (most of them having three or more possible

values), and 46 arcs. The process of triangulation and clique produced a clique tree
with a total of 1,440 potentials. For a single piece of evidence, the total time to
return posterior probability distributions for all37 nodes required approximately 250
msec. This value is an upper bound on inference time, as the sizes of the cliques in
the clique tree decrease with increasing size of the evidence set.

Implementation
The numerical engine is written in the C programming language, and is readily
portable to any UNIX-based environment as a library that can be linked to other ap­
plications. The engine works as a function that takes as input a vector of instanti­
ated nodes, and returns a vector of probability distributions over the remaining
nodes. A network produced in Ergo can be saved as a resource for use in other pro­
grams.
On the Macintosh such a resource can be incorporated into a Hypercard stack. This
resource allows the user to construct, using the Hypertalk progr amming language, a
customized user interface that runs a Bayesian expert system independently of Ergo.
The stack fully supports instantiation and inference, and may be distributed to any
users with computers that run Hypercard.

Summary
Ergo demonstrates the feasibility of constructing and using nontrivial Bayesian ex­
pert systems; it combines an intuitive user interface with an efficient and portable
numeric engine, and is implemented on readily available hardware. These features
combine to make Ergo a powerful system for rapid prototyping of belief networks.
