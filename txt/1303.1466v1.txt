Abstract

Relational models for diagnosis are based on a
direct description of the association between
disorders and manifestations. This type of model
has been specially used and developed by Reggia
and his co-workers in the late eighties as a basic
starting point for approaching diagnosis problems.
The paper proposes a new relational model which
includes Reggia's model as a particular case and
which allows for a more expressive representation
of the observations and of the manifestations
associated with disorders. The model distinguishes,
i) between manifestations which are certainly
absent and those which are not (yet) observed, and
ii) between manifestations which cannot be caused
by a given disorder and manifestations for which
we do not know if they can or cannot be caused by
this disorder. This new model, which can handle
uncertainty in a non-probabilistic way, is based on
possibility theory and so-called twofold fuzzy sets,
previously introduced by the authors.

INTRODUCTION

The paper views the diagnosis problem as it is considered
in relation-based models where a relation describes the
association between disorders and manifestations. This
view, although elementary, enables us to discuss basic
issues in relation with uncertainty in diagnosis problems.
The completely informed case where there is no
uncertainty in the association between disorders and
manifestations and where all manifestations are observable
and observed, is first dealt with in Section 2. Then a
model is proposed in Section 3 for the case where we
only have incomplete information about the
manifestations which are present and about the
manifestations which are indeed caused by a given disorder.
This situation can be interpreted in terms of two-valued
possibility and necessity measures. Namely we distinguish
between manifestations whose presence is necessarily true
(or if we prefer, certain) and those whose presence is only
possible. The proposed model is compared in Section 4 to
the parsimonious covering theory developed by Reggia et
al. (1985) which appears to be a particular case. Section 6
presents a new model based on twofold fuzzy relations and

twofold fuzzy sets (Dubois and Prade, 1987), which has a
greater expressive power. As previously pointed out in
Section 5, the model departs from fuzzy relational models
first proposed by Sanchez (1977, 1979) and others (e.g.
Tsukamoto and Terano, 1977; Pappis and Sugeno, 1985;
Adlassnig et al., 1986; Asse et al., 1987; Kitowski and
Bargiel, 1987) which are more appropriate when the
intensity of the disorders and of the manifestations are a
matter of degree. By contrast in our model, the presence of
disorders or manifestations is not a matter of intensity but
may be pervaded with uncertainty: they are either present
or absent, but we may be more or less unsure about the
presence of a manifestation when a disorder is present or
about the observation of a manifestation. The new model
presented in Section 6 is a graded version of the one
proposed in the incompletely informed case but the
handling of uncertainty remains ordinal and thus
qualitative. Especially manifestations more or less
certainly absent as well as those more or less certainly
present are taken into account. Similarly the model
manipulates the fuzzy set of manifestations which are
more or less certainly produced by a disorder and the fuzzy
set of manifestations which cannot be, more or less
certainly, produced by this disorder. A preliminary version
of this work appears in (Dubois and Prade, 1993)

RELATIONAL APPROACH : THE
COMPLETELY INFORMED CASE

Let 3 be a system whose current state is described by
means of a n-tuple of binary attributes (a1• ..., ai, ..., a0).
When ai = 1 we shall say that the manifestation mi is
present; when ai = 0, it means that mi is absent. When

there is no manifestation present, 3 is said to be in its
normal state and its state is described by the n-tuple
(0, ... , 0, ... , 0). Let J.t denote the set of the n possible
manifestations { m1, ..., mi, ... , m n}. Let flJ be a set of
possible disorders (dt, ..., dj, ..., dk}· A disorder can be
present or absent. To each di we associate the set M(dj) of
manifestations which are entailed, or if we prefer caused,
produced, by the presence of dj alone. We frrst consider the
completely informed case where all the present
manifestations are observed and where the set of
manifestations which appear when a disorder is present is

perfectly known. Thus if m ie M(d j) it means that mi is
not caused by dj- We thus define a relation Ron flJ x Jvt,
defined by (dj-m i) e R � mi

V D e 2.0 in the completely informed case (and not only
"'

for D = { d}). Then the potential set D of all the disorders
which can individually be responsible for M+ is given by

Given a set M+ of present manifestations which are
observed, the problem is to find what disorder(s) may have

produced the manifestations in M+. We suppose that the

set M- = Jvt - M+ = M+ is the set of manifestations
which are absent, i.e. all manifestations which are present
are observed. While deductive reasoning enables us to
predict the presence of manifestation(s) from the presence
of disorder(s), abductive reasoning looks for possible
cause(s) of observed effects. In other words, we look for
plausible explanations (in terms of disorders) of an
observed situation. Clearly while it is at least theoretically
possible to find out all the possible causes which may
have led to a given state of the system 3, the ordering of
the possible solutions according to some levels of
plausibility is out of the scope of logical reasoning,
strictly speaking. However we may for instance prefer the
solutions which involve a small number of disorders, and
especially the ones, if any, which rely on only one
disorder. This is called the principle of parsimony. In case
several disorders may be jointly present (here we do not
consider situations where disorder di followed by dj has not
the same effects in terms of manifestations as d j followed

by di ), we have to define the set of manifestations
produced by the presence of a pair of disorders (di, dj) alone,
and more generally by a tuple of disorders. In the
hypothesis that effects can be added and do not interfere,
we have
,
M({di,d j}) M(di) u M(dj)
(1)
=

=

M(di) n M(dj)

i.e. the manifestations which are absent are those which
are not produced by dj or dj separately. If this hypothesis
is not acceptable, a subset M(D) of entailed manifestations
should be prescribed for each subset D � flJ of disorders
which can be jointly present. In other words, we then

THE CASE OF INCOMPLETE
INFORMATION

When not all the information is available, the set M+ of

manifestations which are certainly present and the set M­
of manifestations which are certainly absent no longer

form a partition of Jvt ; indeed we have M+ n M- = 0
but M+ u M- :;:. Jvt . Similarly, for some d, we
sometimes do not know if a manifestation m follows or

and consequently
M({di,dj})

107

2.0 should be replaced by the appropriate set 8?:- of
associations of disorders which indeed make sense.

In the completely informed case described above, we have

i) M+ = �. i.e. all the present manifestations are
observed, and equivalently all the manifestations which are

not from d; in that case me M(d)+ and me M(d)-. In

other words, the union of the set M(d)+ of manifestations

which are certainly produced by d alone and the set M(d)­
of manifestations which certainly cannot be caused by d

alone, no longer covers Jvt, i.e. 3d, M(d)+ u M(d)-:;:.

Jvt, but, we always have M(d)+

"'

belongs to the set D of potential disorders which alone can

explain both M+ and M- if and only if d does not produce
with certainty any manifestation which is certainly absent
in the evidence, and no observed manifestations must be
ruled out by d. Formally we have

not observed are indeed absent, and ii) Vd, M(d) = M(d)+ =

M(dr. where M(d)+ (resp. M(d)- ) is the set of
manifestations which are certainly present (resp. certainly
absent) when disorder d alone is present. In case M(D) :;:.

n M(d)- = 0. Denoting

MO(d) = Jv0- (M+(d) u M-(d)), if m e MO(d) it means
that m is only a possible manifestation of d. In particular
m may be absent or present when d is present. Then d

This also writes

Clearly (5) reduces to (2) in the completely informed case

since then�= M+ and M(d)- =M(d)+. Note that if
"'

.

M(d)+ = 0 =M(d)-, then de D, i.e. a disorder for which
absolutely no knowledge is available about its effects, can
be always considered as a potential responsible for
observed manifestations. Note also that (5) satisfactorily
covers the extreme situation where there is no genuine
disorder. Indeed if d e D, M(d)- = Jvt entails M+= 0, i.e.
a "disorder" without manifestation cannot explain a
situation where a manifestation is observed; reciprocally
""

M- = )>{, entails M(d)+ = 0, if de D, i.e. if we are
certain that there is no manifestation, this is only
compatible with a "disorder" which is not certainly
followed by a manifestation.
When D = 0, we can look for explanations in terms of
subsets of disorders which are not singletons. (3) is then
extended by
A.

DD={D e $t!;;; 2.0,M(D)+!;;;�andM(D)-!;;;M +} (6)
for the subsets of disorders which alone may explain M+

andM-. As expected what is present and what is absent

play symmetrical roles, exchanging + and - in (5) or (6).
Note that if M- = 0, i.e. if we only know manifestations
which are certainly present, (5) (or (6)) may yield a result

. D :�: .0 (or DD :�: 8t.) provided that M(dr :�: Jvt , i.e. we
have non-trivial information on the set of manifestations
M(dr (orM(D)) which may be produced by a disorder d

(or a subset of disorders D) alone; indeedM(dr ;;;2 M(d)+

(resp.M(Dr ;;;2 M(D)+) gathers the manifestations which
are certainly produced by d (resp. D) and the manifestations
for which we do not know if they can or cannot follow
from d (resp. D), i.e. ifM-= 0,

D= {de .0,M(d)-r,:M+}.
00= {De 3t-!;;;2.0,M(D)-!;;; M+}

(7)

In the non-completely informed case the hypothesis (1)
that effects can be added and do not interfere writes (for two

disorders)

f

and

M({di,dj })+=M(di)+ uM(dj)+

(8)

M({di,dj }r =M(dir n M(djr.

Clearly (8) reduces to (1) in the completely informed case.
Note that the second equality of (8) still writes

which says that the possible manifestations of two
simultaneous disorders gather the manifestations possibly
produced by each disorder, as for certain manifestations.

LINK WITH REGGIA ET AL. 'S
APPROACH

Reggia et al. (1985) (see also Peng and Reggia, 1990)
have extensively studied a relation-based formulation of
diagnosis problems. In their model they assume the
knowledge of a relation between disorders and
manifestations, such that the fact that the pair (dj,mi)

satisfies this relation "means d j may directly cause mi.
Note that this does not mean that dj necessarily causes mi,
but only that it might", as stated in (Peng and Reggia,
1990). But these authors do not explain why they make
this choice for interpreting the "causal" relation between

)>{, and .0 . Moreover the set M+ of "manifestation
known to be present" is supposed to be available.

Thus, in their model, what is known is the set M(d)- of
manifestations possibly attached to a disorder, for each
disorder d; it is also assumed that (8) holds for computing

M(Dr for D !;;;; .0 . Since in this model M- = 0,

(7)

applies, and indeed {d} such that M(dr ;;:;;2 M+ and more
generally D such that M(Dr :2 M+ (applying

(8),

i.e.

M(Dr= Ude DM(dn are called "covers" ofM+ by Peng
and Reggia

(1990) .

These authors more particularly look for so-called
"parsimonious" covers, especially relevant, irredundant and
minimum covers. D is a relevant cover if V d e D, 3 me

M+, (d,m) e R; D is irredundant if none of its proper

subsets is also a cover of M+; D is m i n i m u m if its

cardinality is smallest among all covers of M+. Clearly a
one-disorder cover is a minimal cover, a minimal cover is
an irredundant cover, an irredundant cover is a relevant
cover, a relevant cover is obviously a cover. The set of
relevant covers is defined by

since in Peng and Reggia

(1990) the relation R is defined

by (d,m) e R �me M(dr, using our notations. These
notions could easily be extended to framework where
possible and sure manifestations are told apart. For
instance the set of relevant covers could be defined by
{De 8t.!;;;; 2.0 , M(dr n M+ :1: 0 andM(d)+ n M-:�: 0},

weakening the conditions M(D)+!;;;�and
;
M(D)- �M+
in (6). Consequently our relational diagnosis model is
more general than Reggia's, in the incompletely informed
case.

GRADED UNCERTAINTY VS.
GRADED INTENSITY OF
PRESENCE

I n the late seventies Sanchez (1977, 1979), Tsukamoto
and Terano (1977) already developed diagnosis methods
based on a fuzzy relational model. Several slightly
different proposals have been made. We consider here the
simplest version which corresponds to the type of
diagnosis problem presented in the preceding section,
where, i) R is a fuzzy relation defined on fl) x J.f.,, and ii)
M+ is a fuzzy set Indeed, it seems desirable in practice to
be able to model a more gradual association between
manifestations and disorders, and to take into account the
uncertainty or vagueness pervading the observation of
manifestations. Although this suggests the possible
interest of some fuzzy set-based methods, it is not right
away clear what should be the precise interpretation of the
degrees of association llR (d j, m i ), of the degrees of
membership JlM +(mi ) when the relation R or the subset
M+ is fuzzy, or of the degrees attached to disorders which
are then proposed for the explanation of M+, knowing R.
For instance Kitowski and Bargel (1987) spoke of the
partial occurrence of a disorder, or of the uncertain
observation of a manifestation, but other interpretations
can be thought of.

There are basically two types of interpretations which can
be contemplated, one pertaining to the level of fulfilment
of a gradual manifestation, the other to the uncertainty of
statements pertaining to observations. Namely, on the one
hand we may be uncertain about the presence of a
manifestation because its observation is, difficult, costly,
or even untimely, or on the other hand manifestations may
be a matter of degree (e.g. in medical diagnosis, the fever
of a patient may be more or less high). In the first
interpretation the uncertainty pervading our knowledge of
actual manifestations stems from the use of easy, or quick
observation methods whose results are imprecise. This
may occur even if the presence or absence of a
manifestation is an all or nothing matter: the presence of a
binary manifestation can be more or less certain (
(m )
+ i

0)

or more or less possible

(1

�

-

�_(mi)

0) due to

unreliable or imprecise measurement. This case is studied
in the following.
On the contrary, J..IM +(mi) can model the intensity of a
manifestation mi . This second interpretation is only

possible if the underlying attribute ai is no longer binary.
For instance, instead of considering that mi means "fever"
or "not fever", it looks more natural to consider "high
fever" as a manifestation. The vagueness pertaining to the
word "high" reflects the fact that fever is a matter of degree
and can be measured on a numerical scale S (ranging from
35 to 42 degrees, say). "High fever" refers to a fuzzy set F
of S (that means "close to 40", say) in a given context. If
x E S is the temperature of the patient, then ll

"not high fever". The semantics of the fuzzy
complementation "1 - " significantly differs in the two
situations: when grades of membership express intensities
of presence of symptoms the complementation is dictated
by an equivalence between strong intensity of "high fever"
and low intensity of "not-high fever". When grades of
membership express degrees of uncertainty of presence of
binary symptoms, the complementation reflects the
duality between certainty and possibility of presence, and
obeys the f ollowing rule: what is certain must be
possible, but not the converse, hence M+ !:: �.
Similarly the degree of association llR(dj,mi) may account
for the uncertainty that m i follows from the presence of dj,
or for the intensity of manifestation m i when dj is present
(which again supposes that the severeness of the effect can
be graded); if the level of disorder dj may itself be more or
less severe llR (dj,mi) may even correspond to a gradual

rule, like the more severe the disorder, the stronger the
manifestation. The intensity of the disorder then simply
reflects the level of matching between (numerical)
measurements and the most acute forms of the
manifestations caused by the disorder (like "high fever").
On the contrary if we interpret llR (dj,mj) as a degree of
uncertainty it may either mean to what extent m i

necessarily follows from the presence of dj or only to what
extent it is possible that mi is present when dj is present.
In particular if the fuzzy set M(dj) (llM ( d ) (m i )
j

=

llR(dj,mi)) gathers the manifestations which more or less
certainly or necessarily follow from dj, the fact that mi is

such that llR (d j,m i)

0

means that either m i does not
follow from dj, or that we do not know (i.e. we have
absolutely no certainty that m i is caused by dj); by
=

contrast if M(dj) is the fuzzy set of manifestations which
more or less possibly follows from dj , llR (d jom i) = 0

means that m i cannot be caused by dj, but llR(dj,mi) = 1
expresses no certainty that m i should accompany dj , it

only expresses that it is fully possible. If llR(dj,mi) does
reflect the uncertainty of presence of manifestation mi due

to disorder dj , but the end-points of the unit interval are
interpreted as impossible (0) and certain (1), then it is
difficult to imagine that llR(dj,mi) represents something

else than the probability that d j causes m i when dj is
present, as used by Peng and R eggia (1990), this
probability being subjective and objective. According to
the interpretation we have in mind, it will lead to different

models with different interpretations of the results. To
some extent the literature on fuzzy relational equations for
diagnosis suffers from a lack of concern for these
representational issues.

Dubois and Prade

The reader is referred to Dubois and Prade (19 9 2b) for a
detailed study and discussion of proposals made in the
fuzzy set literature for handling the diagnosis problem on
the basis of fuzzy relation (in) equations. Viewed in
retrospect these proposals are more appropriate for dealing
with the case where the intensity of the disorders and of
the manifestations is graded, even if they have been often
mistakenly used for dealing with uncertainty. In the
following we extend the model presented in Section 3 to
the case where the uncertainty is graded. We use the
possibilistic framework which offers an ordinal view of
uncertainty only requiring the comparison of levels of
uncertainty.

A NEW M ODEL BASED ON
TW OFOLD FUZZY SETS

By complementation (defined by IJ.F = 1 - !J.p), we obtain
the fuzzy sets �. M(dr (and more generally M(D)J of
manifestations which are more or less possibly present,
respectively, in the considered situation, when d is present,
or when disorders in D are altogether present. This
corresponds to the usual duality between what is (more or
less) certain, i.e. necessarily true, and what is (more or
less) possibly true. Indeed a pair of dual possibility and
necessity measures TI and N are related by the relation
TI(A) = 1 - N(A), for any event A (here A represents the
presence of a manifestation); see Dubois and Prade (1988a)
for instance.

A pair of fuzzy sets (F,G) such that F n G 0 is called a
twofold fuzzy set (Dubois and Prade, 1987). Twofold fuzzy
sets (F,G) have been introduced for modelling
incompletely known sets, i.e. sets for which we know
elements gathered in F, which more or less certainly
belong to it, as well as other elements, gathered in G,
which more or less certainly do not belong to it. But
F u G may not cover the whole referential. Similarly, the

In this section, we propose a graded counterpart of the
model presented for the non-completely informed case.
Namely M+ and M- are now fuzzy sets of manifestations
which are more or less certainly present, and more or less
certainly absent respectively. However we keep the
requirement M+ n M- = 0 (where the intersection is
defmed by the min operation), i.e. we cannot be somewhat
certain both of the presence and of the absence of the same
manifestation simultaneously. Similarly, M(d)+ (more
generally M(D)+) and M(d)- (more generally M(D)-) will
denote the fuzzy sets of manifestations which are
respectively more or less certainly present and more or less
certainly absent when disorder d alone is present (more
generally when the subset D of disorders is present).
Obviously, we also assume 'v'd, M(d)+ n M(d)- = 0 (and
'v'D, M(D)+ n M(D)- = 0).

Note that M+

i.e. the support of M+ is included in the core of M"; the

pairs (M(d)+, M(d)J and (M(D)+, M(D)} define twofold
fuzzy relations on£) x c)\{., and 20 x c)\{. respectively.
The extension to fuzzy sets of equation (S) and (6) can be
very simply done on the basis of (SA). It requires that the
extent to which two fuzzy sets F and G of J-t intersect be
evaluated. The consistency between F and G is simply
defmed as (Zadeh, 1979)
cons(F,G)

=

SUPme c)\{, min(IJ.p(m), !J.G(m)).

It computes the degree of existence of some common
element for F and G. (SA) is based on checking the
inconsistency level between fuzzy sets, that is
1 - cons(F,G). The f�zy extension of (S) then leads to

compute a fuzzy set D of plausible unique disorders as
'v' d ef?J:
J..Lo(d)

min(l -cons(M(d)+,M-), 1- cons(M(d) -,M+) )

where the minimum operator expresses the conjunction of
the conditions in (SA).

check that (11) can be written using (12) as
!lo(d) = min(Inc(M(ct)+, M}, inc(M(d)-, M+))

since inc(F,G) = 1 - cons(F,G).

(11) clearly expresses that a disorder d is all the less a
candidate explanation as the fuzzy set of its more or less
certain effects overlaps the fuzzy set of manifestations
more or less certainly absent, or as the fuzzy set of effects
which are more or less certainly absent when d is present
overlaps the fuzzy set of manifestations which are more or
less certainly present. This is intuitively satisfying.
In the particular case where M- = 0, i.e. we only have
positive observations,

D is defined V d e

f2) by

111

M(d)- = M(d) on Figure 1 (similar figures can be drawn
for M+ and M-).
This suggests that, in order to improve the discrimination
power of the model, we have to refine the non-fuzzy model
in such a way that consequences (resp. manifestations)
previously expressed as certain (resp. certainly present) and
impossible (resp. certainly absent) remain classified in the
same way and where some possible consequences (resp.
possibly present manifestations) are now allowed to be
either somewhat certain (resp. somewhat certainly present)
or somewhat impossible (resp. somewhat certainly
absent). See Figure 3. Then (12) enables us to rank-order
the possible disorders which are compatible with the
observations. This counterbalances the increase of
candidates due to the incompleteness of the information.

Note that the modelling of uncertainty remains here
qualitative. Indeed, we could use a finite completely
ordered chain of levels of certainty ranging between 0 and
1, i.e. .e1 = 0 < .e2 <... < .en = 1 instead of [0,1], with
min(.ei,.ek) = .e i and max(.ei ,.ek) = .e k if i:::;; k, and
1 - .ei = .en 1 i·
+ -

Taking into account the incomplete nature of the
information about the presence or absence of
manifestations decreases the discrimination power when
going from the completely informed case (equation (2)) to
the incomplete information case (equations (5) or (SA)),
""

since then the number of possible disorders in D increases.
This is due to the fact that now there are manifestations
which are neither certain nor impossible and consequences
of the presence of a given disorder d which are only
possible, as pictured in Figure

It can be easily shown that adding preference levels on top
of incompleteness modeling can at the same time enable
the discrimination power of the completely informed
situation to be recovered, and also enable the extra
disorders obtained on the partially informed situation to be
ranked in terms of their plausibility levels. Indeed, assume
that the dichotomy M(d), M(d) of Figure 1 represents a

Q.E.D.

This result indicates that our approach, although much
more qualitative than one based on probability theory, still
possesses the ability to rank-order the set of plausible
unique disorders explaining an incomplete set of
manifestations.
Clearly (11) and (13) straightforwardly extend to subsets D
of disorders which altogether explain both M+ and M-,
substituting D to the singleton {d} in (11) and (13). Indeed
""

when D 0, we have to look for two-element subsets D
which may account for M+ and M-, and then for three­
element subsets if there is no two-element one, and so on
until a plausible explanation is found. The decomposition
properties (8) when they hold, easily extend to the fuzzy
case under the form

�({di,djlr- mm(J.l M(dir' J.l M(dj)_).

(14)

Note that (14) is coherent with the definition of the union
of twofold fuzzy sets. However, if we look for multiple
disorders explaining a given set of manifestations, it is
clear that we shall have a trade-off problem between small
sets of disorders which are most plausible in the sense of
the parsimony principle, and bigger sets of disorders which
are more plausible because they ensure a better covering of
the observed manifestations. This topic, along with the
semantics of (14) for the representation of independent
disorders, requests further investigation.

C ONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have proposed a new model for diagnosis
problems, which is more expressive than Reggia's pure
relational model for representing the available causal
information. The application of this model to practical
diagnosis problems is currently under investigation
(Cayrac et al., 1993). Other models allowing for non­
binary attributes for expressing the intensity of
manifestations and for the expression of gradual
association between the intensities of disorders and
manifestations have still to be developed.
In spite of its greater expressiveness, the model we have
proposed here has still several limitations. Let us mention

two of them. The relational model we consider associates
directly disorders and manifestations. More generally we
may have two relations, between fl> and an intermediary
set 8, and between 8 and J.t ; see (Peng and Reggia,
1987) on this point. Besides, we are not able to capture
the most general kind of incomplete information. For
instance we cannot express that we are certain that
manifestations m i or m j are present (but perhaps one of
them is absent), or a similar information stating that when
disorder d is present it is certain that mi or mj are present
(and that mk or m,e are absent) for instance. See Dubois
and Prade (1988b) for the modelling of such pieces of
knowledge in case of graded uncertainty. The treatment of
the most general kind of incomplete information would
require to work with a (fuzzy) relation R defined on 20 x
2J.t.

In the above model all the effects of a disorder are assumed
to take place simultaneously. This is not always the case
in practice (e.g. Console and Torasso, 1991) and it may be
more realistic to associate with a disorder the sets of
manifestations M(d)t and M(d)� which are respectively
more or less certainly present and more or less certainly
absent t time units after that the disorder begins to take
place. More discussion along this line is in (Dubois and
Prade, 1993)
Another topic for further research is the expression in a
logical formalism of the proposed approach (as Reiter
(1987)'s logical model encodes Reggia's basic ideas), in
order to relate it with methods based on possibilistic
assumption-based truth-maintenance systems; see
(Benferhat, Dubois, Lang and Prade, 1992; Dubois and
Prade, 1992a). More generally it would be interesting to
develop a logical framework where it would be possible to
express both weighted deductive rules associating
manifestations to disorders and weighted evocation rules
(in the sense of Pearl (1988)) associating possible
disorders to manifestations, and perform local reasoning
tasks.
Lastly an interesting issue to be investigated later on is
how to take a priori information about disorders into
account in the framework of non-probabilistic relational
models of diagnosis. To-date the only available-framework
for modeling a priori information in diagnosis problems is
Bayesian probability. However, it is well-known that a
full-fledged probabilistic prior is not always available.
This does not mean that no a priori knowledge is present
The framework of possibilistic abduction (Dubois and
Prade, 1992a) may offer a tool for modeling non­
probabilistic priors either in a purely ordinal setting or in
a quantitative but less demanding framework than Bayesian
probability. The ultimate aim of this research could be the
design of a general causal model of diagnosis under
uncertain and incomplete information that encompasses
the Bayesian model as a special case (when prior
probabilities are likelihood functions for the description of

Relational Model for Diagnosis

the causal knowledge) and the ordinal model described in
this paper (when the prior knowledge corresponds to total
ignorance). In such a general framework, it is clear that the
entries of the fuzzy causal relations should be interpreted
in terms of conditional uncertainty measures that should
be more general than both probability and possibility
measures (like belief functions or probability bounds).
