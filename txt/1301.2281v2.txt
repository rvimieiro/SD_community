Abstract
We introduce a compact graph-theoretic representation for multi-party game theory. Our main
result is a provably correct and efficient algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria
in one-stage games represented by trees or sparse
graphs.

INTRODUCTION

In most work on multi-player game theory, payoffs are represented in tabular form: if  agents play a game in which
each player has (say) two actions available, the game is

given by  matrices, each of size , specifying the payoffs to each player under any possible combination of joint
actions. For game-theoretic approaches to scale to large
multi-agent systems, compact yet general representations
must be explored, along with algorithms that can efficiently
manipulate them  .
In this work, we introduce graphical models for multiplayer game theory, and give powerful algorithms for computing their Nash equilibria in certain cases. An  -player
game is given by an undirected graph on  vertices and a
set of  matrices. The interpretation is that the payoff to
player  is determined entirely by the actions of player 
and his neighbors in the graph, and thus the payoff matrix
for player  is indexed only by these players. We thus view
the global  -player game as being composed of interacting
local games, each involving (perhaps many) fewer players.
Each player’s action may have global impact, but it occurs
through the propagation of local influences.

For multi-stage games, there is a large literature on compact
state-based representations for the different stages of the game,
such as stochastic games or extensive form games (Owen 1995).
Our focus is on representing one-stage, multi-player games.

There are many common settings in which such graphical
models may naturally and succinctly capture the underlying game structure. The graph topology might model the
physical distribution and interactions of agents: each salesperson is viewed as being involved in a local competition
(game) with the salespeople in geographically neighboring
regions. The graph may be used to represent organizational
structure: low-level employees are engaged in a game with
their immediate supervisors, who in turn are engaged in a
game involving their direct reports and their own managers,
and so on up to the CEO. The graph may coincide with the
topology of a computer network, with each machine negotiating with its neighbors (to balance load, for instance).
There is a fruitful analogy between our setting and
Bayesian networks. We propose a representation that is
universal: any  -player game can be represented by choosing the complete graph and the original  -player matrices.
However, significant representational benefits occur if the

graph degree is small: if each player has at most
neighbors, then each game matrix is exponential only in
rather than  . The restriction to small degree seems insufficient to avoid the intractability of computing Nash equilibria. All of these properties hold for the problem of representing and computing conditional probabilities in a Bayes
net. Thus, as with Bayes nets, we are driven to ask the natural computational question: for which classes of graphs
can we give efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms for the
computation of Nash equilibria?
Our main technical result is an algorithm for computing
Nash equilibria when the underlying graph is a tree (or
can be turned into a tree with few vertex mergings). This
algorithm comes in two related but distinct forms. The
first version involves an approximation step, and computes
an approximation of every Nash equilibrium. (Note that
there may be an exponential or infinite number of equilibria.) This algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of
the representation (the tree and the associated local game
matrices), and constitutes one of the few known cases in
which equilibria can be efficiently computed for a large
class of general-sum, multi-player games. The second ver-

sion of the algorithm runs in exponential time, but allows
the exact computation of all Nash equilibria in a tree. In
an upcoming paper (Littman et al. 2001), we describe a
polynomial-time algorithm for the exact computation of a
single Nash equilibrium in trees. Our algorithms require
only local message-passing (and thus can be implemented
by the players themselves in a distributed manner).

RELATED WORK

Algorithms for computing Nash equilibria are well-studied.
McKelvey and McLennan (1996) survey a wide variety of
algorithms covering 2- and  -player games; Nash equilibria and refinements; normal and extensive forms; computing either a sample equilibrium or exhaustive enumeration;
and many other variations. They note that  -player games
are computationally much harder than 2-player games, in
many important ways. The survey discusses approximation techniques for finding equilibria in  -player games.
Several of the methods described are not globally convergent, and hence do not guarantee an equilibrium. A method
based on simplicial subdivision is described that converges
to a point with equilibrium-like properties, but is not necessarily near an equilibrium or an approximate equilibrium.
In contrast, for the restricted cases we consider, our algorithms provide running time and solution quality guarantees, even in the case of general-sum,  -player games.
Nash (1951), in the paper that introduces the notion of Nash
equilibria, gives an example of a 3-player, finite-action
game, and shows it has a unique Nash equilibria. Although
all payoffs are rational numbers, Nash shows that the players’ action probabilities at the equilibrium are irrational.
This suggests that no finite algorithm that takes rational
payoffs and transforms them using addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division will be able to compute exact
equilibrium policies in general. Thus, the existence of an
exact algorithm for finding equilibria in games with treestructured interactions shows that these games are somewhat simpler than general  -player games. It also suggests that approximation algorithms are probably unavoidable for general  -player games.
Several authors have examined graphical representations
of games. Koller and Milch (2001) describe an extension
of influence diagrams to representing  -player games, and
suggest the importance of exploiting graphical structure in
solving normal-form games. La Mura (2000) describes a
closely related representation, and provides globally convergent algorithms for finding Nash equilibria.

PRELIMINARIES

that it is represented in tabular form.

The actions 0 and 1 are the pure strategies of each player,

that the player will play 0. For any joint
mixed strategy, given by a product distribution , we define
the expected payoff to player  as

of joint mixed strategies (product distributions).

ABSTRACT TREE ALGORITHM

In this section, we give an abstract description of our algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in trees (see Figure 1). By “abstract”, we mean that we will leave unspecified (for now) the representation of a certain data structure, and the implementation of a certain computational
step. After proving the correctness of this abstract algorithm, in subsequent sections we will describe two instantiations of the missing details—yielding one algorithm that
runs in polynomial time and computes approximations of
all equilibria, and another algorithm that runs in exponential time and computes all exact equilibria.

E

If is a tree, we can orient this tree by choosing an arbitrary vertex to be the root. Any vertex on the path from a
vertex to the root will be called downstream from that vertex, and any vertex on a path from a vertex to a leaf will be
called upstream from that vertex. Thus, each vertex other
than the root has exactly one downstream neighbor (child),
and perhaps many upstream neighbors (parents). We use
to denote the set of vertices in that are upstream
from , including by definition.

It is now straightforward to describe the details of our approximate algorithm ApproximateTreeNash. This algorithm is identical to algorithm TreeNash with the following
exceptions:

Figure 2: An example game, and the tables computed by the downstream pass of algorithm ApproximateTreeNash. Each vertex in
the tree is a player with two actions. Although we omit the exact payoff matrices, intuitively each “M” player maximizes its payoff by
matching its child’s action, while each “O” player maximizes its payoff by choosing the opposite action of its child. The relative payoff
for matching or unmatching is modulated by the parent values, and also varies from player to player within each vertex type. The grid

EXACT ALGORITHM

In this section, we describe an implementation of the missing details of algorithm TreeNash that computes exact,
rather than approximate, equilibria. In the worst case, the
algorithm may run in time exponential in the number of
vertices. We remind the reader that even this result is
nontrivial, since there are no finite-time algorithms known
for computing exact Nash equilibria in general-sum, multiparty games.

Lemma 6 proves that any fixed choice of one rectangular
region (where the table is 1) from each
leads to at
most 2 rectangular regions where
is 1. It is also
easy to show that the tables at the leaves have at most 3
rectangular regions. From this it is straightforward to show
by induction that for any vertex in the tree with child ,

This is a finite bound (which is at most at the root of the
entire tree) on the number of rectangular regions required
to represent any table in algorithm TreeNash. We thus have
given an implementation of the downstream pass—except
for the maintainence of the witness lists. Recall that in the
approximation algorithm, we proved nothing special about
the structure of witnesses, but the witness lists were finite
(due to the discretization of mixed strategies). Here these
lists may be infinite, and thus cannot be maintained explicitly on the downstream pass. However, it is not difficult to
see that witnesses can easily be generated dynamically on
the upstream pass (according to a chosen deterministic rule,
randomly, non-deterministically, or with some additional
bookkeeping, uniformly at random from the set of all equilibria). This is because given

vertices (whose action set will now be the product action
space for the merged players) to convert arbitrary graphs
into trees. To handle the merged vertices, we must ensure that the merged players are playing approximate best
responses to each other, in addition to the upstream and
downstream neighbors. With this additional bit of complexity (again proportional to the size of the representation
of the final tree) we recover our result (Theorem 5).

EXTENSIONS

We have developed a number of extensions and generalizations of the results presented here. We describe some of
them briefly, leaving details for the long version of this paper. At this writing, we have verified these extensions only
for the approximation algorithm, and are working on the
generalizations for the exact algorithm.
Multiple Actions. For ease of exposition, our approximation algorithm was presented for tree games in which players have only two actions available to them. By letting the
tables
computed in the downstream pass of this
algorithm be of the size necessary to represent the crossproduct of the action spaces available to and , we can
recover the same result (Theorem 5) for the multiple-action
case. The computational cost in the multiple-action case is
exponential in the number of actions, but so is the size of
the local game matrices (and hence the size of the representation of the tree game).

Vertex Merging for Sparse Graphs. The extension to
multiple actions also permits the use of our approximation algorithm on arbitrary graphs. This is analogous to the

As with the polytree algorithm, running time will scale exponentially with the largest number of merged players, so
it is vital to minimize this cluster size. How best to accomplish this we leave to future work.
Special Equilibria. The approximation algorithm has the
property that it finds an approximate Nash equilibrium for
every exact Nash equilibrium. The potential multiplicity
of Nash equilibria has led to a long line of research investigating Nash equilibria satisfying particular properties.
By appropriately augmenting the tables computed in the
downstream pass of our algorithm, it is possible to identify
Nash equilibria that (approximately) maximize the following measures in the same time bounds:



Player Optimum: Expected reward to a chosen player.



Social Optimum: Total expected reward, summed over
all players.
Welfare Optimum: Expected reward to the player
whose expected reward is smallest.

Equilibria with any of these properties are known to be NPhard to find in the exact case, even in games with just two
players (Gilboa and Zemel 1989).
