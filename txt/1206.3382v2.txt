Abstract
We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In online planning,
the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the set of possible policies from
that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses the outcome of that exploratory deliberation
to choose what action to perform next. The performance of algorithms for online planning
is assessed in terms of simple regret, which is the agent’s expected performance loss when
the chosen action, rather than an optimal one, is followed.
To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are either
best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret over time. Here
we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, BRUE, that guarantees exponentialrate reduction of simple regret and error probability. This algorithm is based on a simple
yet non-standard state-space sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each
sample are dedicated to different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows
that BRUE not only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effective in
practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art. We then extend BRUE with a variant
of “learning by forgetting.” The resulting set of algorithms, BRUE(α), generalizes BRUE,
improves the exponential factor in the upper bound on its reduction rate, and exhibits even
more attractive empirical performance.

1. Introduction
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a standard model for planning under uncertainty (Puterman, 1994). An MDP hS, A, T r, Ri is defined by a set of possible agent states S, a set of
agent actions A, a stochastic transition function T r : S × A × S → [0, 1], and a reward function R : S ×A×S → R. Depending on the problem domain and the representation language,
the description of the MDP can be either declarative or generative (or mixed). In any case,
the description of the MDP is assumed to be concise. While declarative models provide
the agents with greater algorithmic flexibility, generative models are more expressive, and
both types of models allow for simulated execution of all feasible action sequences, from
any state of the MDP. The current state of the agent is fully observable, and the objective
of the agent is to act so to maximize its accumulated reward. In the finite horizon setting
that will be used for most of the paper, the reward is accumulated over some predefined
number of steps H.
The desire to handle MDPs with state spaces of size exponential in the size of the model
description has led researchers to consider online planning in MDPs. In online planning,
1

the agent, rather than computing a quality policy for the entire MDP before taking any
action, focuses only on what action to perform next. The decision process consists of a
deliberation phase, aka planning, terminated either according to a predefined schedule or
due to an external interrupt, and followed by a recommended action for the current state.
Once that action is applied in the real environment, the decision process is repeated from
the obtained state to select the next action and so on.
The quality of the action a, recommended for state s with H steps-to-go, is assessed in
terms of the probability that a is sub-optimal, and in terms of the (closely related) measure
of simple regret ∆H [s, a]. The latter captures the performance loss that results from taking
a and then following an optimal policy π ∗ for the remaining H −1 steps, instead of following
π ∗ from the beginning (Bubeck & Munos, 2010). That is,
∆H [s, a] = QH (s, π ∗ (s, H)) − QH (s, a),
where


QH (s, a) = Es0 R(s, a, s0 ) + QH−1 (s0 , π ∗ (s0 , H − 1)) .
With a few recent exceptions developed for declarative MDPs (Bonet & Geffner, 2012;
Kolobov, Mausam, & Weld, 2012; Busoniu & Munos, 2012), most algorithms for online
MDP planning constitute variants of what is called Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). One
of the earliest and best-known MCTS algorithms for MDPs is the sparse sampling algorithm
by Kearns, Mansour, and Ng (Kearns, Mansour, & Ng, 1999). Sparse sampling offers a nearoptimal action selection in discounted MDPs by constructing a sampled lookahead tree in
time exponential in discount factor and suboptimality bound, but independent of the state
space size. However, if terminated before an action has proved to be near-optimal, sparse
sampling offers no quality guarantees on its action selection. Thus it does not really fit
the setup of online planning. Several later works introduced interruptible, anytime MCTS
algorithms for MDPs, with UCT (Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006) probably being the most
widely used such algorithm these days. Anytime MCTS algorithms are designed to provide
convergence to the best action if enough time is given for deliberation, as well as a gradual
reduction of performance loss over the deliberation time (Sutton & Barto, 1998; Péret &
Garcia, 2004; Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006; Coquelin & Munos, 2007; Cazenave, 2009; Rosin,
2011; Tolpin & Shimony, 2012). While UCT and its successors have been devised specifically
for MDPs, some of these algorithms are also successfully used in partially observable and
adversarial settings (Gelly & Silver, 2011; Sturtevant, 2008; Bjarnason, Fern, & Tadepalli,
2009; Balla & Fern, 2009; Eyerich, Keller, & Helmert, 2010).
In general, the relative empirical attractiveness of the various MCTS planning algorithms
depends on the specifics of the problem at hand and cannot usually be predicted ahead of
time. When it comes to formal guarantees on the expected performance improvement over
the planning time, very few of these algorithms provide such guarantees for general MDPs,
and none breaks the barrier of the worst-case only polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret
and choice-error probability over time.
This is precisely our contribution here. We introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search
algorithm, BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of both simple regret and
choice-error probability over time, for general MDPs over finite state spaces. The algorithm
is based on a simple and efficiently implementable sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which

different parts of each sample are dedicated to different competing exploratory objectives.
The motivation for this objective decoupling came from a recently growing understanding
that the current MCTS algorithms for MDPs do not optimize the reduction of simple regret
directly, but only via optimizing what is called cumulative regret, a performance measure
suitable for the (very different) setting of reinforcement learning (Bubeck & Munos, 2010;
Busoniu & Munos, 2012; Tolpin & Shimony, 2012; Feldman & Domshlak, 2012). Our
empirical evaluation on some standard MDP benchmarks for comparison between MCTS
planning algorithms shows that BRUE not only provides superior performance guarantees,
but is also very effective in practice and favorably compares to state of the art. We then
extend BRUE with a variant of “learning by forgetting.” The resulting family of algorithms,
BRUE(α), generalizes BRUE, improves the exponential factor in the upper bound on its
reduction rate, and exhibits even more attractive empirical performance.

2. Monte-Carlo Planning
MCTS, a high-level scheme for Monte-Carlo tree search that gives rise to various specific
algorithms for online MDP planning, is depicted in Figure 1. Starting with the current state
s0 , MCTS performs an iterative construction of a tree T rooted at s0 . At each iteration,
MCTS issues a state-space sample from s0 , expands the tree T using the outcome of that
sample, and updates information stored at the nodes of T . Once the simulation phase is
over, MCTS uses the information collected at the nodes of T to recommend an action to
perform in s0 . For compatibility of the notation with prior literature, in what follows we
refer to the tree nodes via the states associated with these nodes. Note that, due to the
Markovian nature of MDPs, it is unreasonable to distinguish between nodes associated with
the same state at the same depth. Hence, the actual graph constructed by most instances
of MCTS forms a DAG over nodes (s, h) ∈ S × {0, 1, . . . , H}. By A(s) ⊆ A in what follows,
we refer to the subset of actions applicable in state s.
Numerous concrete instances of MCTS have been proposed, with UCT (Kocsis & Szepesvári,
2006) probably being the most popular such algorithm these days (Gelly & Silver, 2011;
Sturtevant, 2008; Bjarnason et al., 2009; Balla & Fern, 2009; Eyerich et al., 2010; Keller
& Eyerich, 2012a). To give a concrete sense of MCTS’s components, as well as to ground
some intuitions discussed later on, below we describe the specific setting of MCTS corresponding to the core UCT algorithm, and Figure 2 illustrates the UCT tree construction,
with n denoting the number of state-space samples.

• sample: The samples ρ = hs0 , a1 , s1 , . . . , ak , sk i are all issued from the root node s0 .
The sample ends either when a sink state is reached, that is, A(sk ) = ∅, or when
k = H. Each node/action pair (s, a) is associated with a counter n(s, a) and a value
b a). Both n(s, a) and Q(s,
b a) are initialized to 0, and then updated
accumulator Q(s,
by the update-statistics procedure. Given si , the next-on-the-sample action ai+1 is
selected according to the deterministic UCB1 policy (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, & Fischer,
2002a), originally proposed for optimal cumulative regret minimization in stochastic
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems (Robbins, 1952): If n(si , a) > 0 for all a ∈ A(si ),

where n(s) = a n(s, a). Otherwise, ai+1 is selected uniformly at random from the
still unexplored actions {a ∈ A(si ) | n(si , a) = 0}. In both cases, si+1 is then sampled according to the conditional probability P(S|si , ai+1 ), induced by the transition
function T r.
• expand-tree: Each state-space sample ρ = hs0 , a1 , s1 , . . . , ak , sk i induces a state trace
hs0 , s1 , . . . , si i inside T , as well as a state trace hsi+1 , . . . , sk i outside of T . In principle,
T can be expanded with any prefix of hsi+1 , . . . , sk i; a popular choice in prior work
appears to be expanding T with only the upper-most node si+1 . (If T is constructed
as a DAG, it is expanded with the first node along ρ that leaves T .)
• update-statistics: For each node si along ρ that is now part of the expanded tree T ,
the counter n(si , ai+1 ) is incremented and the estimated Q-value is updated as

where Ri =

R(sj , aj+1 , sj+1 ).

• recommend-action: Interestingly, the action recommendation protocol of UCT was
never properly specified, and different applications of UCT adopt different decision
rules, including maximization of the estimated Q-value, of the augmented estimated
Q-value as in Eq. 1, of the number of times the action was selected during the simulation, as well as randomized protocols based on the information collected at the
root.
The key property of UCT is that its exploration of the search space is obtained by
considering a hierarchy of forecasters, each minimizing its own cumulative regret, that is,
the loss of the total reward incurred by exploring the environment (Auer et al., 2002a).
Each such pseudo-agent forecaster corresponds to a state/steps-to-go pair (s, h). In that
respect, according to Theorem 6 of Kocsis and Szepesvári (2006), UCT asymptotically
achieves the best possible (logarithmic) cumulative regret. However, as recently pointed out
in numerous works (Bubeck & Munos, 2010; Busoniu & Munos, 2012; Tolpin & Shimony,
2012; Feldman & Domshlak, 2012), cumulative regret does not seem to be the right objective
for online MDP planning, and this is because the rewards “collected” at the simulation

phase are fictitious. Furthermore, the work of Bubeck, Munos, and Stoltz (2011) on multiarmed bandits shows that minimizing cumulative regret and minimizing simple regret are
somewhat competing objectives. Indeed, the same Theorem 6 of Kocsis and Szepesvári
(2006) claims only a polynomial-rate reduction of the probability of choosing a non-optimal
action, and the results of Bubeck et al. (2011) on simple regret minimization in MABs with
stochastic rewards imply that UCT achieves only polynomial-rate reduction of the simple
regret over time. Some attempts have recently been made to adapt UCT, and MCTS-based
planning in general, to optimizing simple regret in online MDP planning directly, and some
of these attempts were empirically rather successful (Tolpin & Shimony, 2012; Hay, Shimony,
Tolpin, & Russell, 2012). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them breaks UCT’s
barrier of the worst-case polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret over time.

3. Simple Regret Minimization in MDPs
We now show that exponential-rate reduction of simple regret in online MDP planning is
achievable. To do so, we first motivate and introduce a family of MCTS algorithms with a
two-phase scheme for generating state space samples, and then describe a concrete algorithm
from this family, BRUE, that (1) guarantees that the probability of recommending a non5

optimal action asymptotically convergences to zero at an exponential rate, and (2) achieves
exponential-rate reduction of simple regret over time.
3.1 Exploratory concerns in online MDP planning
The work of Bubeck et al. (2011) on pure exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems was probably the first to stress that the minimal simple regret can increase as the
bound on the cumulative regret is decreases. At a high level, Bubeck et al. (2011) show
that efficient schemes for simple regret minimization in MAB should be as exploratory as
possible, thus improving the expected quality of the recommendation issued at the end of
the learning process. In particular, they showed that the simple round-robin sampling of
MAB actions, followed by recommending the action with the highest empirical mean, yields
exponential-rate reduction of simple regret, while the UCB1 strategy that balances between
exploration and exploitation yields only polynomial-rate reduction of that measure. In that
respect, the situation with MDPs is seemingly no different, and thus Monte-Carlo MDP
planning should focus on exploration only. However, the answer to the question of what it
means to be “as exploratory as possible” with MDPs is less straightforward than it is in
the special case of MABs.
For an intuition as to why the “pure exploration dilemma” in MDPs is somewhat complicated, consider the state/steps-to-go pairs (s, h) as pseudo-agents, all acting on behalf of
the root pseudo-agent (s0 , H) that aims at minimizing its own simple regret in a stochastic
MAB induced by the applicable actions A(s0 ). Clearly, if an oracle would provide (s0 , H)
with an optimal action π ∗ (s0 , H), then no further deliberation would be needed until after
the execution of π ∗ (s0 , H). However, the task characteristics of (s0 , H) are an exception
rather than a rule. Suppose that an oracle provides us with optimal actions for all pseudoagents (s, h) but (s0 , H). Despite the richness of this information, (s0 , H) in some sense
remains as clueless as it was before: To choose between the actions in A(s0 ), (s0 , H) needs,
at the very least, some ordinal information about the expected value of these alternatives.
Hence, when sampling the futures, each non-root pseudo-agent (s, h) should be devoted to
two objectives:
(1) identifying an optimal action π ∗ (s, h), and
(2) estimating the actual value of that action, because this information is needed by the
predecessor(s) of (s, h) in T .
Note that both these objectives are exploratory, yet the problem is that they are somewhat competing. In that respect, the choices made by UCT actually make sense: Each
sample ρ issued by UCT at (s, h) is a priori devoted both to increasing the confidence in that
some current candidate a† for π ∗ (s, h) is indeed π ∗ (s, h), as well as to improving the estimate
of Qh (s, a† ), while as if assuming that π ∗ (s, h) = a† . However, while such an overloading of
the samples is unavoidable in the “learning while acting” setup of reinforcement learning,
this should not necessarily be the case in online planning. Moreover, this sample overloading in UCT comes with a high price: As it was shown by Coquelin and Munos (2007), the
number of samples after which the bounds of UCT on both simple and cumulative regret
become meaningful might be as high as hyper-exponential in H.

3.2 Separation of Concerns at the Extreme
Separating the two aforementioned exploratory concerns is at the focus of our investigation
here. Let s0 be a state of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards in [0, 1], K applicable actions
at each state, B possible outcome states for each action, and finite horizon H. First, to
get a sense of what separation of exploratory concerns in online planning can buy us, we
begin with a MAB perspective on MDPs, with each arm in the MAB corresponding to a
“flat” policy of acting for H steps starting from the current state s0 . A “flat” policy π is a
minimal partial mapping from state/steps-to-go pairs to actions that fully specifies an acting
strategy in the MDP for H steps, starting at s0 . Sampling such an arm π is straightforward
as π prescribes precisely which action should be applied at every state that can possibly
be encountered along the execution of π. The reward of such an arm π isPstochastic, with
H−1 i
H
support [0, H], and the number of arms in this schematic MAB is K 0 = K i=0 B ≈ K B .
Now, consider a simple algorithm, NaiveUniform, which systematically samples each
”flat” policy in a loop, and updates the estimation of the corresponding arm with the
obtained reward. If stopped at iteration n, the algorithm recommends π(s0 ), where π is
the arm/policy with best empirical value µ̂π,n . By the iteration n of this algorithm, each
arm will be sampled at least b Bn H c times. Therefore, using the Hoeffding’s inequality, the
K
probability that the chosen arm π is sub-optimal in our MAB is bounded by

(4)

Note that NaiveUniform uses each sample ρ = (s0 , a0 , s1 , a1 , . . . , aH−1 , sH ) to update the
estimation of only a single policy π. However, recalling that arms in our MAB problem
are actually compound policies, the same sample can in principle be used to update the
estimates of all policies π 0 that are consistent with ρ in the sense that, for 0 ≤ i ≤ H − 1,
π 0 (si , H − i) is defined and it is defined as π 0 (si , H − i) = ai . The resulting algorithm,
CraftyUniform, generates samples by choosing the actions along them uniformly at random,
and uses the outcome of each sample to update all the policies consistent with it. Note
that sampling the arms in CraftyUniform cannot be done systematically as in NaiveUniform
because the set of policies updated at each iteration is stochastic.
Since the sampling is uniform, the probability of any policy to be updated by the sample
issued at any iteration of CraftyUniform is K1H . For an arm π 0 , let Nπ0 ,n denote the number
of samples issued at the n iterations of CraftyUniform that are consistent with the policy π 0 .
The probability that π, the best empirical arm after n iterations, is sub-optimal is bounded
by

Note that this transition period length is still much better than that of UCT, which is
hyper-exponential in H. Moreover, unlike in UCT, the rate of the simple regret reduction
is then exponential in the number of iterations.
3.3 Two-phase sampling and BRUE
While both the simple regret convergence rate, as well as the length of the transition period
of CraftyUniform, are more attractive than those of UCT, this in itself is not much of a
H
help: CraftyUniform requires explicit reasoning about K B arms, and thus it cannot be
efficiently implemented. However, it does show the promise of separation of concerns in
online planning. We now introduce an MCTS family of algorithms, referred to as MCTS2e,
that allows utilizing this promise to a large extent.
The instances of the MCTS2e family vary along four parameters: switching point function σ : N → {1, . . . , H}, exploration policy, estimation policy, and update policy. With
respect to these four parameters, the MCTS components in MCTS2e are as follows.
• Similarly to UCT, each node/action pair (s, a) is associated with variables n(s, a)
b a). However, while counters n(s, a) are initialized to 0, value accumulators
and Q(s,
b a) are schematically initialized to −∞.

• sample: Each iteration of BRUE corresponds to a single state-space sample of the
MDP, and these samples ρ = hs0 , a1 , s1 , . . . , ak , sk i are all issued from the root node
s0 . The sample ends either when a sink state is reached, that is, A(sk ) = ∅, or when
k = H. The generation of ρ is done in two phases: At iteration n, the actions at states
s0 , . . . , sσ(n)−1 are selected according to the exploration policy of the algorithm, while
the actions at states sσ(n) , . . . , sk−1 are selected according to its estimation policy.
• expand-tree: T is expanded with the suffix of state sequence s1 , . . . , sσ(n)−1 that is
new to T .
• update-statistics: For each state si ∈ {s0 , . . . , sσ(n)−1 }, the update policy of the algorithm prescribes whether it should be updated. If si should be updated, then the
counter n(si , ai+1 ) is incremented and the estimated Q-value is updated according to
Eq. 2 (p. 4).
• recommend-action: The recommended action is chosen uniformly at random among
b 0 , a).
the actions a maximizing Q(s
In what follows, for n > 0, the n-th iteration of BRUE will be called H-iteration if σ(n) = H.
At a high level, the two phases of sample generation respectively target the two exploratory
objectives of online MDP planning: While the sample prefixes aim at exploring the options,
the sample suffixes aim at improving the value estimates for the current candidates for π ∗ .
In particular, this separation allows us to introduce a specific MCTS2e instance, BRUE,1
that is tailored to simple regret minimization. The BRUE setting of MCTS2e is described
below, and Figure 3 illustrates its dynamics.
• The switching point function σ : N → {1, . . . , H} is
σ(n) = H − ((n − 1) mod H),

(9)

that is, the depth of exploration is chosen by a round-robin on {1, . . . , H}, in reverse
order.
• At state s, the exploration policy samples an action uniformly at random, while the
estimation policy samples an action uniformly at random, but only among the actions

a ∈ A(s) that maximize Q(s,
• For a sample ρ issued at iteration n, only the state/action pair (sσ(n)−1 , aσ(n) ) immediately preceding the switching state sσ(n) along ρ is updated. That is, the information
obtained by the second phase of ρ is used only for improving the estimate at state
sσ(n)−1 , and is not pushed further up the sample. While that may appear wasteful
and even counterintuitive, this locality of update is required to satisfy the formal
guarantees of BRUE discussed below.
Before we proceed with the formal analysis of BRUE, a few comments on it, as well as
on the MCTS2e sampling scheme in general, are in place. First, the template of MCTS2e is
1. Short for Best Recommendation with Uniform Exploration; the name is carried on from our first
presentation of the algorithm in (Feldman & Domshlak, 2012), where “estimation” was referred to as
“recommendation.”

rather general, and some of its parametrizations will not even guarantee convergence to the
optimal action. This, for instance, will be the case with a (seemingly minor) modification
of BRUE to purely uniform estimation policy. In short, MCTS2e should be parametrized
with care. Second, while in what follows we focus on BRUE, other instances of MCTS2e
may appear to be empirically effective as well with respect to the reduction of simple regret
over time. Some of them, similarly to BRUE, may also guarantee exponential-rate reduction
of simple regret over time. Hence, we clearly cannot, and do not, claim any uniqueness of
BRUE in that respect. Finally, some other families of MCTS algorithms, more sophisticated
that MCTS2e, can give rise to even more (formally and/or empirically) efficient optimizers of
simple regret. The BRUE(α) set of algorithms that we discuss later on is one such example.

4. Upper Bounds on Simple Regret Reduction Rate with BRUE
For the sake of simplicity, in our formal analysis of BRUE we assume uniqueness of the
optimal policy π ∗ ; that is, at each state s and each number h of steps-to-go, there is a
single optimal action, and it is π ∗ (s, h). Let Tn be the graph obtained by BRUE after n
b h (s, a) denote the accumulated value Q(s,
b a) for s at depth H − h. For

b h (s, a). We also use some additional auxiliary notation.

K = maxs∈S |A(s)|, i.e., the maximal number of actions per state.
p = mins,a,s0 :T r(s,a,s0 )>0 T r(s, a, s0 ), i.e., the likelihood of the least likely (but still possible) outcome of an action in our problem.
d = mins,a ∆1 [s, a], i.e., the smallest difference between the value of the optimal and a
second-best action at a state with just one step-to-go.
Our key result on the BRUE algorithm is Theorem 1 below. The proof of Theorem 1, as
well as of several required auxiliary claims, is given in Appendix A. Here we outline only
the key issues addressed by the proof, and provide a high-level flow of the proof in terms of
a few central auxiliary claims.
Theorem 1 Let BRUE be called on a state s0 of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards in
[0, 1] and finite horizon H. There exist pairs of parameters c, c0 > 0, dependent only on
{p, d, K, H}, such that, after n > H iterations of BRUE, we have simple regret bounded as
0

E∆H [s, πnB (s0 , H)] ≤ Hc · e−c n ,
and choice-error probability bounded as

0
P πnB (s0 , H) 6= π ∗ (s0 , H) ≤ c · e−c n .

(13)

Before we proceed any further, some discussion of the statements in Theorem 1 are in
place. First, the parameters c and c0 in the bounds established by Theorem 1 are problemdependent: in addition to the dependance on the horizon H and the choice branching factor
K (which is unavoidable), the parameters c and c0 also depend on the distribution parameters p and d. While it is possible that this dependence can be partly alleviated, Bubeck
et al. (2011) showed that distribution-free exponential bounds on the simple regret reduction rate cannot be achieved even in MABs, that is, even in single-step-to-go MDPs (see
Remark 2 of Bubeck et al. (2011), which is based on a lower bound on the cumulative
11

regret established by Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, & Schapire, 2002b). Second, the specific
parameters c and c0 provided by Eqs. 12 and 13 are worst-case for MDPs with parameters
d, p, and K, and the bound in Eq. 10 becomes effective after

iterations, for some small constant ε > 1. While there is still some gap with this transition
period length and the transition period length of the theoretical CraftyUniform algorithm
(see Eq. 8), this gap is not that large.2
The proof of Lemma 2 below constitutes the crux of the proof of Theorem 1. Once
we have proven this lemma, the proof of Theorem 1 stems from it in a more-or-less direct
manner.
Lemma 2 Let BRUE be called on a state s0 of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards in [0, 1]
and finite horizon H. For each h ∈ JHK, there exist parameters ch , c0h > 0, dependent only
on {p, d, K, H}, such that, for each state s reachable from s0 in H − h steps and any t > 0,
it holds that

it is easy to verify that, by the Chernoff-Hoeffding inequality,

that is, the assertion is satisfied with c1 = 1 and c01 = d2 . Now, assuming the claim holds
for h ≥ 1, below we outline the proof for h + 1, relegating the actual proof in full detail to
Appendix A.
In the proof for h > 1, it is crucial to note the invalidity of applying the ChernoffHoeffding bound directly, as was done in Eq. 17. There are two reasons for this.

proof of Theorem 1 even more involved.

a be an action applicable in s, and let πtB be a policy induced by running BRUE on s0 until
exactly t > 0 samples have finished their exploration phase with applying action a at s with
h − 1 steps still to go. Given that,
• Xt,h (s, a) is a random variable, corresponding to the reward obtained by taking a at
s, and then following πtB for the remaining h − 1 steps.
• Et,h (s, a) is the event in which Xt,h (s, a) is sampled along the optimal actions at each
of the h − 1 choice points delegated to πtB .
• δt,h (s, a) = Qh (s, a) − E [Xt,h (s, a)] .

5. Learning With Forgetting and BRUE(α)
When we consider the evolution of action value estimates in BRUE over time (as well
as in all other Monte-Carlo algorithms for online MDP planning), we can see that, in
internal nodes these estimates are based on biased samples that stem from the selection
of non-optimal actions at descendant nodes. This bias tends to shrink as more samples
are accumulated down the tree. Consequently, the estimates become more accurate, the
probability of selecting an optimal action increases accordingly, and the bias of ancestor
nodes shrinks in turn. An interesting question in this context is: shouldn’t we weigh
differently samples obtained at different stages of the sampling process? Intuition tells
us that biased samples still provide us with valuable information, especially when they
are all we have, but the value of this information decreases as we obtain more and more
accurate samples. Hence, in principle, putting more weight on samples with smaller bias
could increase the accuracy of our estimates. The key question, of course, is which of all
possible weighting schemes are both reasonable to employ and preserve the exponential-rate
reduction of expected simple regret.
Here we describe BRUE (α), an algorithm that generalizes BRUE ≡ BRUE(1) by basing
the estimates only on the α fraction of most recent samples. We discuss the value of this
addition both from the perspective of the formal guarantees, as well as from the perspective
of empirical prospects. BRUE(α) differs from BRUE in two points:
b a), each node/action pair (s, a) in BRUE(α)

Theorem 6 Let BRUE (α) be called on a state s0 of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards
in [0, 1] and finite horizon H. There exist pairs of parameters c, c0 > 0, dependent only on
{α, p, d, K, H}, such that, after n > H iterations of BRUE, we have simple regret bounded
as

E∆H [s, πnB (s0 , H)] ≤ Hc · e−c n ,
(25)
and choice-error probability bounded as

0
P πnB (s0 , H) 6= π ∗ (s0 , H) ≤ c · e−c n .

(26)

The proof for Theorem 6 follows from Lemma 7 below similarly to the way Theorem 1
follows from Lemma 2. Note that in Theorem 6 we do not provide explicit expressions for
the constants c and c0 as we did in Theorem 1 (for α = 1). This is because the expressions
that can be extracted from the recursive formulas in this case do not bring much insight.
However, we discuss the potential benefits of choosing α < 1 in the context of our proof of
Theorem 6.
Lemma 7 Let BRUE(α) be called on a state s0 of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards in
[0, 1] and finite horizon H. For each h ∈ JHK, there exist parameters ch , c0h > 0, dependent
only on {α, p, d, K, H}, such that, for each state s reachable from s0 in H − h steps and any
t > 0, it holds that

The proof for Lemma 7 is by induction, following the same line of the proof for Lemma 2.
In fact, it deviates from the latter only in the application of the modified Hoeffding-Azuma
inequality, which has to be further modified to capture the partial sums as in BRUE(α).
Lemma 8 (Modified Hoeffding-Azuma inequality for partial sums) Let {Xi }∞
i=1 be
a sequence of random variables with support [0, h] and µi , EXi . If limi→∞ µi = µ, and

provided by Lemma 3 for BRUE, that is, when all accumulated samples are averaged. While
both bounds are very similar, the exponent of the second exponential term is multiplied for
BRUE(α < 1) by (1 − α) t. This poses a tradeoff: Decreasing α reduces the sampling bias,
c
and thus decreases the term cpe , but increases the other exponential term with no leading
constant. Obviously, since there is no bias at leaf nodes, it makes no sense to set α < 1
c
there. However, as we go further up the tree, the bias tends to grow ( cpe >> 1), but we also
expect to have more samples (t is larger). Thus, from the perspective of formal guarantees,
it seems appealing to choose smaller values of α. Nevertheless, we do not try to optimize
here the value of α: First, optimizing bounds doesn’t necessarily lead to optimized empirical
accuracy. Second, the underlying optimization would have to be specific to each horizon h
and each sample size t (which is obviously out of the question), and thus anyway we would
have to consider only some rough approximations to this optimization problem. Finally,
biased samples in practice might be more valuable than what the theory suggests, as long
as all actions at the same state/steps-to-go decision point experience a similar bias.

6. Experimental Evaluation
We have evaluated BRUE empirically on the MDP sailing domain (Péret & Garcia, 2004)
that was used in previous works for evaluating MC planning algorithms (Péret & Garcia,
2004; Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006; Tolpin & Shimony, 2012), as well as on random game trees
used in the original empirical evaluation of UCT (Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006).
In the sailing domain, a sailboat navigates to a destination on an 8-connected grid
representing a marine environment, under fluctuating wind conditions. The goal is to reach
the destination as quickly as possible, by choosing at each grid location a neighbor location
to move to. The duration of each
√ such move depends on the direction of the move (ceteris
paribus, diagonal moves take 2 more time than straight moves), the direction of the wind
relative to the sailing direction (the sailboat cannot sail against the wind and moves fastest
with a tail wind), and the tack. The direction of the wind changes over time, but its strength
is assumed to be fixed. This sailing problem can be formulated as a goal-driven MDP over
finite state space and a finite set of actions, with each state capturing the position of the
sailboat, wind direction, and tack.

Figure 4: Empirical performance of BRUE, BRUE(0.9), UCT, and -greedy + UCT (denoted
as GCT, for short) in terms of the average error on sailing domain problems on
n × n grids with n ∈ {5, 10, 20, 40}.

In a goal-driven MDP, the lengths of the paths to a terminal state are not necessarily
bounded, and thus it is not entirely clear to what depth BRUE shall construct its tree.
In the sailing domain, we chose H to be 4 × n, where n is the grid-size of the problem
instance, as it is unlikely that the optimal path between any two locations on the grid will
be larger than a complete encircling of the considered area. We note, however, that the
recommendation-oriented samples ρ̄ always end at a terminal state, similar to the rollouts
issued by UCT and -greedy + UCT.
Snapshots of the results for different grid sizes are shown in Figure 4. We compared
BRUE with two MCTS-based algorithms: the UCT algorithm, and a recent modification of
UCT, -greedy + UCT, obtained from the former by replacing the UCB1 policy at the root
node with the -greedy policy (Tolpin & Shimony, 2012). The motivation behind the design
of -greedy + UCT was to improve the empirical simple regret of UCT, and the results for
-greedy + UCT reported by (Tolpin & Shimony, 2012) (and confirmed by our experiments

here) are very impressive. We also show the results for BRUEper (0.9), a slight modification
of BRUE(0.9) with a more permissive update scheme: Instead of updating only the stateaction node at the level of the switching point, we also update any ancestor for which either
not all applicable actions have been sampled or the chosen action was identical to the best
empirical one.
All four algorithms were implemented within a single software infrastructure. As suggested by more recent works on UCT, the exploration coefficient for UCT and -greedy + UCT
(parameter c in Eq. 1) was set to the empirical best value of an action at the decision
point (Keller & Eyerich, 2012b). (This setting of the exploration coefficient resulted in better performance of both UCT and -greedy + UCT than with the settings reported on the
sailing domain in the respective original publications.) The  parameter in -greedy + UCT
was set to 0.5 as in the experiments of Tolpin & Shimony, 2012. Each algorithm was run
on 1000 randomly chosen initial states s0 , and the performance of the algorithm was assessed in terms of the average error Q(s0 , a) − V (s0 ), that is, the difference between the
true values of the action a chosen by the algorithm and that of the optimal action π ∗ (s0 ).
Consistently with the results reported by Tolpin and Shimony (2012), on the smaller tasks
-greedy + UCT outperformed UCT by a very large margin, with the latter exhibiting very
little improvement over time even on the smallest, 5 × 5, grids. The difference between
-greedy + UCT and UCT on the larger tasks was less notable. In turn, BRUE substantially
outperformed -greedy + UCT, with the improvement being consistent except for relatively
short planning deadlines, and BRUEper (0.9) performed even better than BRUE.
The above allows us to conclude that BRUE is not only attractive in terms of the
formal performance guarantees, but can also be very effective in practice for online planning.
Likewise, the “learning with forgetting” extension of BRUE(α) also has its practical merits.
Under the same parameter setting of UCT and -greedy + UCT, we have also evaluated the
18

three algorithms in a domain of random game trees whose goal is a simple modeling of
two-person zero-sum games such as Go, Amazons and Globber. In such games, the winner
is decided by a global evaluation of the end board, with the evaluation employing this or
another feature counting procedure; the rewards thus are associated only with the terminal
states. The rewards are calculated by first assigning values to moves, and then summing up
these values along the paths to the terminal states. Note that the move values are used for
the tree construction only and are not made available to the players. The values are chosen
uniformly from [0, 127] for the moves of MAX, and from [−127, 0] for the moves of MIN.
The players act so to (depending on the role) maximize/minimize their individual payoff:
the aim of MAX is to reach terminal s with as high R(s) as possible, and the objective of
MIN is similar, mutatis mutandis. This simple game tree model is similar in spirit to many
other game tree models used in previous work (Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006; Smith & Nau,
1994), except that the success/failure of the players in measured not on a ternary scale of
win/lose/draw, but via the actual payoffs they receive. We ran some experiments with two
different settings of the branching factor (B) and tree depths (D). As in the sailing domain,
we compared the convergence rate obtained by BRUE, UCT and -greedy + UCT. Figure 5
plots the average error rate for two configurations, B = 6, D = 6 and B = 2, D = 16, with
the average in each setting obtained over 500 trees. The results here appear encouraging as
well, with BRUE overtaking the other two algorithms more quickly on the deeper trees.

7. SUMMARY
We have introduced BRUE, a simple Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in MDPs
that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of the performance measures of interest, namely
the simple regret and the probability of erroneous action choice. This improves over previous
algorithms such as UCT, which guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of these measures.
The algorithm has been formalized for finite horizon MDPs, and it was analyzed as such.
However, our empirical evaluation shows that it also performs well on goal-driven MDPs
and two-person games.
A few questions remain for future work. In the setting of γ-discounted MDPs with
infinite horizons, a straightforward way to employ BRUE is to fix a horizon H, use the
algorithm as is, and derive guarantees on the aforementioned measures of interest by simply accounting for the additive gap of γ H Rmax /(1 − γ) between the state/action values
under horizon H and those under an infinite horizon. However, this is not necessarily the
best way to plan online for infinite-horizon MDPs, and thus this setting requires further
inspection. Second, it is not unlikely that the state-space independent factors ch , and c0h
in the guarantees of BRUE can be improved by employing more sophisticated combinations
of exploration and estimation samples. Another important point to consider is the speed
of convergence to the optimal action, as opposed to the speed of convergence to “good”
actions. BRUE is geared towards identifying the optimal action, although in many large
MDPs, “good” is often the best one can hope for. To identify the optimal solution, BRUE
devotes samples equally to all depths. However, focusing on nodes closer to the root node
may improve the quality of the recommendation if the planning time is severely limited.
Finally, the core tree sampling scheme employed by BRUE differs from the more standard
scheme employed in previous work. While this difference plays a critical role in establishing
19

the formal guarantees of BRUE, it is still unclear whether that difference is necessary for
establishing exponential-over-time reduction of the performance measures.

Proposition 10 (Number of Child Samples Bound) Let BRUE be called on a state
s0 of an MDP hS, A, T r, Ri with rewards in [0, 1] and finite horizon H. Let (s, h) be a node
reachable from (s0 , H), and in turn, (s0 , h0 ) be a node reachable from (s, h) via an action
sequence that starts with applying action a at s. Then, for any a0 ∈ A (s0 ), we have

where ph (s, a) is the probability that an (H − h)-iteration of BRUE will issue a sample,
whose exploration phase ends with applying action a at state s with h steps still to go.
22

Proof: By the choice of the switching point function of BRUE as in Eq. 9, the number
of samples of action a0 in the descendant node (s0 , h0 ) between two consecutive samples of
action a in node (s, h) is distributed according to
1+γ
X

βi ,

(34)

i=1

where γ ∼ Geo (ph (s, a)) and βi ∼ Ber (ph0 (s0 , a0 )) are all independent random variables.
Indeed, for every pair of consecutive iterations n < n0 with σ(n) = σ(n0 ) = H − h,
(i) there is exactly one iteration n < n00 < n0 with σ(n00 ) = H − h0 , and
(ii) the number of (H −h)-iterations between two consecutive (H −h)-iterations that finish
their exploration phase with applying action a at s is geometric.
Putting (i) and (ii) together, the number of (H −h0 )-iterations between a pair of consecutive
(H − h)-iterations that finish their exploration phase with applying action a at s is also
geometric. In turn, the probability that an (H − h0 )-iteration will finish its exploration
phase with applying a0 at s0 is ph0 (s0 , a0 ), and thus the number of (H − h0 )-iterations that
finish their exploration phase with applying a0 at s0 between a pair of consecutive (H − h)iterations that finish their exploration phase with applying action a at s is distributed as
in Eq. 34.
Similarly, it can be shown that the (conditioned) random variable

The second bound can be proven in much the same way.

Proof of Lemma 5:
Lemma 4 implies that, with probability approaching 1 exponentially fast, the state-space
samples issued at a level with h + 1 steps-to-go are optimal. That is, their expectation
equals the actual Q-value. Therefore, by Lemma 4, we have
P {E [Xt,h+1 (s, a) | X1,h+1 (s, a), . . . , Xt−1,h+1 (s, a)] 6= Q (s, a)} ≤ cp e−ce t ,

where cp = 2Kh(2 + ch ) and ce = 6Kh . It is also easy to see that 0 ≤ Xi ≤ h + 1, and thus
the conditions of Lemma 3 are satisfied. In turn, from Lemma 3 for δ = d2 and random

Proof of Lemma 2, induction step:
Note that the proof of Lemma 5 is basically the proof of the induction step for the key part
of Lemma 2, that is, Eq. 14. The only thing that remains to be finalized is the correctness
of Eqs. 15 and 16 for h + 1, and these can be verified by substitution of ch and c0h in Eq. 56
by the respective expressions (for h) from Eqs. 15 and 16.
Proof of Theorem 1:
The proof for our main results follows by using the same techniques as above. Note that,
by the Hoeffding inequality, after n > 0 iterations of BRUE, for each action a ∈ A(s0 ), it
holds that

Eqs. 11, 12, and 13 of Theorem 1 are then obtained by substitution of cH and c0H in Eq. 61
with the respective expressions from Eqs. 15 and 16. In turn, Eq. 10 of Theorem 1 stems
from Eqs. 11, horizon H, and per-step rewards being in [0, 1].

Appendix B. Proof of Theorem 6
We first prove the modified Hoeffding-Azuma inequality for partial sums.
Proof of Lemma 8 (Modified Hoeffding-Azuma inequality for partial sums):
Let Et be the event that E [Xt | X1 , . . . , Xt−1 ] = µ, and let
Yt , Xt − µ | X1 (ω) , . . . , Xt−1 (ω) .
The random variable Yt is bounded by h − µ ≥ Yt ≥ −µ, and furthermore, for ω ∈ Et ,
EYt = 0. Therefore, using Fact 13, for all ω ∈ Et and λ ∈ R+ , it holds that

Obviously, at leaf nodes there is no point in choosing α < 1 since there is no bias.
H
Therefore, for h = 1 we can use the same constants c1 = 1 and c01 = Kp H . Since c0h is
H−h

decreasing with h, we have c0h ≤ Kp H−h for all 1 ≤ h ≤ H, and thus Lemma 4 is valid.
Lemma 5 relies on the modified Hoeffding-Azuma inequality, which is no longer valid in
the context of BRUE (α). Instead, we apply its modification, Lemma 8 for partial sums, to
prove the induction step

Since ch is increasing in h and c0h is decreasing in h, the term 12K
pc0h (1−α)
in h. The larger the constant grows, the more beneficial it might be to increase the exponent
coefficient that multiplies that constant by decreasing α at the expense of decreasing the
exponent coefficient that multiplies 1. Clearly, the tradeoff depends also on t, the number
of samples of action a in node (s, h). Therefore, as h increases, smaller values of α would
be more appealing.
