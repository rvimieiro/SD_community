Abstract

Bayesian knowledge bases (BKBs) are a gen­
eralization of Bayes networks and weighted
proof graphs (WAODAGs), that allow cycles
in the causal graph. Reasoning in BKBs re­
quires finding the most probable inferences
consistent with the evidence. The cost­
sharing heuristic for finding least-cost ex­
planations in WAODAGs was presented and
shown to be effective by Charniak and Hu­
sain. However, the cycles in BKBs would
make the definition of cost-sharing cyclic as
well, if applied directly to BKBs. By treat­
ing the defining equations of cost-sharing as
a system of equations, one can properly de­
fine an admissible cost-sharing heuristic for
BKBs. Empirical evaluation shows that cost­
sharing improves performance significantly
when applied to BKBs.

INTRODUCTION

Bayes networks [7] are a commonly used reasoning
tool within the uncertainty in AI community. Lately,
graphical causal probabilistic models have shown up
that generalize on the acyclic Bayes networks, in or­
der to cater for causal phenomena which cannot be
strictly partially ordered. These models have causal
cycles [1, 8], or undirected sections in the directed
graphs [2J. Clearly, one stii! needs to do either be­
lief revision or belief updating [7] in order to perform
reasoning in these schemes. These more general mod­
els, being less restrictive, pause interesting problems
in implementing reasoning algorithms for them.
Bayesian knowledge bases (BKBs) [8] are a general­
ization of Bayes networks and weighted (AND/OR,
directed acyclic) proof graphs (acronym WAODAGs)
[4], that allow cycles in the causal graph. Consider the
problem of finding the most probable inference ("ex­
planation") consistent with the evidence in a BKB.
This problem is analogous to (and more general than)
the NP-hard problem of belief revision in Bayes net-

works, or finding minimum-cost proof on a WAODAG.
As for Bayes networks, reasoning with tree-shaped
BKBs can be done efficiently. However, it is clear that
in actual applications we cannot usually force our rep­
resentation to belong to the easy class of problems.
To-date, finding most-probable inference in general
BKBs has been implemented as best-first heuristic
search, where the heuristic used was cost-so-far, with
dismal results. The reason is that this local heuris­
tic does not take into account the cost of nodes (or
variables) to be assigned later on in the search. Prop­
agation of costs to be incurred is much preferable, but
it is non-trivial to do so in a manner resulting in an
admissible heuristic. The latter was first achieved by
using the cost-sharing propagated cost method [3] (see
next section for a brief definition).
It was shown by Charniak and Husain [3] that for find­
ing least-cost explanations in WAODAGs, the ( admis­
sible) cost-sharing heuristic has a much better perfor­
mance. The cost sharing heuristic was also found use­
ful for belief revision in Bayes networks [9). Here, we
generalize cost-sharing to apply to cyclic graphs, and
show that the resulting heuristic is also admissible.
The generalization of the cost-sharing heuristic, while
straightforward, causes several problems. First, the
cycles in the BKB make the problem of properly defin­
ing the heuristic nontrivial. If we just used the same
defining equations, the fact that there are cycles would
make the defining equations cyclic. But by looking
at these equations as a system of equations, we state
that a solution to the system is our heuristic. Any
such solution to the system of equations is shown to
be an admissible heuristic. A second problem is how
to solve these equations. The standard top-down algo­
rithm used in prior work would be hindered by the cy­
cles: even if we convert it to a kind of message-passing
updating algorithm, in many cases the algorithm will
loop indefinitely. Instead, we show that converting the
system of semi-linear equations to a linear program, we
can evaluate the heuristic in polynomial time.
We begin with a motivating BKB example, followed
by a formal definition of BKBs (section 2). We then
relate BKBs to WAODAGs, and review the cost shar-

ing heuristic for WAODAGs. In Section 4 we extend
cost-sharing to handle cy cles, and present an efficient
method of computing the heuristic. Section 5 discusses
several implementation issues and refinements. Sec­
tion 6 compares search with cost-sharing to search with
a local "cost-so-far" heuristic.

BAYESIAN KNOWLEDGE BASES

In modeling an uncertain world, we designate random
variables (abbrev. RVs) to represent the discrete ob­
jects or events in question. We then assign a joint
probability distribution to each possible state of the
world, i.e., a specific value assignment for each RV.
Graphical probabilistic models, such as Bayes net­
works [7], represent the existing dependencies in the
model (variables not shown as dependent are assumed
independent) , facilitating a concise representation of
the distribution- as a set of conditional probabilities.
Let D, E and F be RVs. The conditional probabil­
ity, P(DIE, F), identifies the belief in D's truth given
that E and F are both known to be true, and repre­
sents an uncertain causal rule. We call D the head of
P(DIE, F) and {E, F} the tail.
The distribution of the model is defined by,
n

P(A1, ... , An)=

II P(A;IX(A;))

(1)

i=l

where X(A;) is the set of RVs which Ai condition­
ally depends upon. If set X(A;) is small, the amount
of information we must actually store to be able to
compute the required joint probability is considerably
(exponentially) less than the size of the cross product
of the domains.
In Bayes networks, the conditional dependencies are
represented with a directed acyclic graph. Let A, B
and C be RVs representing a traffic light, its asso­
ciated vehicle detector and pedestrian signal, respec­
tively. Suppose that the vehicle detector affects the
traffic light, which in turn affects the pedestrian sig­
nal. Figure 1 graphically depicts this network over
these variables. Since the signal depends upon the
light, we say that A is the parent of C. Similarly, B is
the parent of A.
Now, expand the model with an additional variable
denoting time of day, and suppose that the domain

expert wishes to add the conditional probability that
the detector is tripped during rush hour when the light
is red. Such an inclusion would introduce a cycle into
our graph, which would not be permitted in a Bayes
network. In the application domain, however, such
cycles are frequently a natural representation.
By introducing a finer level of distinction than one
node per RV, using instead one node for each possi­
ble RV instantiation, the BK B representation finesses
this problem. Assuming the same trio of RV s and the
partial set of values below:
P(C ="Don't Walk" lA =red)=x1

P(A = greenjB = On) = X3
P(C = "Walk"IA =green) = x2
P(A = redlB

=

Off) =X4

We can legally add the new constraint, P(B =On lA =
red, D =rush hour) =xs, without creating a directed
cycle, as shown in Figure 2. Additionally, it is possi­
ble to have cycles in the knowledge graph in certain
cases, without jeopardizing consistency of the distri­
bution (see [8]).
A BK B graph has two distinct types of nodes. The
first, shown as lettered ovals, corresponds to individ­
ual RV instantiations. These are called instantiation
nodes or !-nodes for short. The second type of node,
depicted as a blackened circle, is called a support node
or 5-node. These nodes, which represent the condi­
tional probability value, have exactly one out-bound
arrow to the instantiation node representing the head
of the conditioning case. Support nodes also have zero
or more in-bound dependency or conditioning arrows
representing the tail of the conditioning case.
The above representation of the conditional probabili­
ties, by separating out the variable-states and the (pos­
sibly partial) conditioning, results both in more flexi­
bility, and a more compact representation [8]. These
properties are extremely useful in knowledge acqui-

We define the topology as follows:
Definition 1 A correlation-graph G

= (IUS, E) is a
directed graph such that InS = 4> and E � {I x S} U
{S xI}. Furthermore, for all a E S, (a,b) and (a,b')
are in E if and onl y if b = b'. {IUS} are the nodes
of G and E are the edges of G. A node in I is called
an instantiation-node (abbrev. 1-node) and a node in
S is called a support-node (abbrev. S-node).

1-nodes represent the various states of the world such
as the truth or falsity of a proposition.
S-nodes, on
the other hand, explicitly e mbody the relationships
between the 1-nodes.
Let 1r be a partition on I. Intuitively, 1r denotes the
groups of 1-nodes (states) which are mutually exclu­
sive. This can be used to represent random variables
with discrete but multiple instantiations, with each
partition cell corresponding to an RV.
Definition 2 G

is said to I- respect 1r if for all cells O"
in 1r, for any S-node b E S such that (b, a) E E, b does
not have a parent in O" except, possibly, a.
Basically, mutually exclusive 1-nodes cannot be di­
rectly related to each other through the S-nodes. Next,
we define mutual exclusion between S-nodes.

b2 in S are said to

different /-nodes c1, c2 that are parents of b1, bz, re­
spectively and c1, c2 are in the same cell in 11".

Definition 4 G is said to S-respect 1r if for all /-nodes

b2) are mutually exclusive.

To complete our knowledge-graph, we define a function
w from S to �- This serves as the mechanism for
handling uncertainty in the relationships.
Definition 6 A knowledge-graph K is a 3-tuple
(G, w, 1r) where G = (/US, E) is a correlation-graph,
w is a function from S to the positive reals (for each
a E S, w(a) is the weight of a), 1r is a partition on I,
and G respects 1r.

The probabilistic semantics of a knowledge graph is
provided by relating weights to probabilities, as fol­
lows: P'(a) = e-w(a), where P'(a) is the conditional
probability that the child of a is true given that the

parents of a are true. To make sure that the probabil­
ities obey the axioms of probability theory, a normal­
ization constraint is enforced [8] on BKBs. However,
this issue is irrelevant to finding most-probable infer­
ence, and is thus beyond the scope of this paper.

2.2

INFERENCE GRAPHS

A BKB is a knowledge graph, together with an infer­
ence scheme. The latter is defined by a set of permissi­
ble inference graphs. An i nferen ce graph is a subgr aph
of the knowledge graph corresponding to an inference
chain (or proof) . Let r
(I' U S', E') be some sub­
graph of our correlation-graph G = (I U S, E) where
I' � I, S' � S, and E' � E. Furthermore, r has a
weight w ( r) defined as follows:
=

An 1-node a E J' is said to be well-supported in r i f
i t h as a n incoming S-node i n r (that is, if there exists
an edge (b, a) in E'). An S-node b is said to be well­
founded in r if all its incoming 1-nodes (conditions)
are also present in r. An S-node b E S' is said to be
well-defined in r if it supports some I-node.
is said to be an inference over K if i t is acyclic,
consistent (i.e. for all cells O" in 1r, II' n O"l � 1), all of
its 1-nodes are well supported, and all of its S-nodes
are well-founded and well-defined. An inference thus
corresponds to a proof. Given the knowledge graph in
F igure 3, one possible inference can be seen in Figure 4.

r

For an abductive BKB, the problem we are address­
ing is, given a set s of 1-nodes, find an inference r of
minimum weight that contains all of s. Given the se­
mantics of costs in BKBs, such an inference (proof)
is equivalent to a maximum probability explanation
(abductive inference) for s.

COST-SHARING IN WAODAGS

graphs, with a single sink (out-degree 0) node s (called

edges. The actual solution is the set of nodes abutting
the dummy edges. Since we need to find the minimal
cost solution, we need a heuristic value for each cut. In
fact, the heuristic value is defined over both edges and
nodes, as follows. Let w ( v ) be the weights of the root
nodes. We define the heuristic cost function c from
E U V U 2E to the non-negative reals as:
if v is a root node
if v is an AND node
if v is an OR node
for nodes,

v
ce
( )
the evidence node), and a partition of nodes into AND
nodes (corresponding to S-nodes in a BKB) and OR
nodes (I-nodes in a BKB). The evidence node is an
AND node. Each WAODAG node has an associated
cost (or weight). A proof r of sis a subgraph contain­
ing s where for each AND node in r, all of its parents
are in r, and for each OR node in r, at least one of its
parents are in r. Proofs in WAODAGs correspond to
inferences in BKBs. The partition function 1r has no
counterpart in WAODAGs.
The cost of a proof r is the sum of the weights of all
nodes in r. As for knowledge graphs, one would like to
find a least cost proof that contains the evidence node
s. This is an NP-hard problem, usually solved by best­
first search, starting from s, and adding parents when
necessary (branching when several possibilities exist at OR nodes). An obvious admissible heuristic, cost­
so-far, estimates the cost of a partial proof p as the
sum of costs of nodes currently in p.
The heuristic can be improved upon by propagating
costs, but preserving admissibility is non-trivial. Such
an improved heuristic, cost-sharing, was first presented
in [3], where the search is in terms of edges, rather
than nodes. We review the cost-sharing heuristic for
WAODAGs below, beginning with some necessary no­
tation borrowed from [3].
Let edge e = ( a, b) (from node a to node b); we call a
the source of e, and b the sink of e. Also, we say that
b is a child (immediate descendent) of a. If e is an
edge, then v. denotes that node v is its source, and u•
denotes that u is its sink (we also sometimes use the
notation Ve also to denote the source node of e, likewise
for sinks). If v is a node, then e is an arbitrary edge
v
v
incoming to v, and e an outgoing edge from v. Also,
Ev is the set of all incoming edges of v, and Ev is the
set of all outgoing edges. A node with no parents is
called a root node.
For convenience, a dummy edge e' leading from the
evidence node is added to the graph, as well as one
dummy edge leading into each root node. A state
in the search space is a cut of the WAODAG (a set­
wise minimal set of edges that separates s from the
root nodes). The initial state is the set { e'}, and a
final state is a cut consisting only of root node dummy

COST-SHARING IN BKBS

For BKBs, we intend to use the same definitions for the
cost-sharing heuristic. One difference between BKBs
and WAODAGs is that in WAODAGs, only root nodes
have weights, whereas in BKBs every S-node has a
weight. The difference can be overcome by observing
that for each S-node v we can always add one new 1'
node and S-node pair (call the latter v ) , set w ( v' ) =
w (v), and let the new w ( v ) be 0.
The semantics of
the BKB stay the same, and now only root nodes have
non-0 cost. Instead of doing that, we will note that
the new I-node only has one parent and one child, and
absorb w ( v' ) into the equation for v, to get:

if v is an S node

(2)

for nodes, and the same equations as above for edges.
Noting, however, the optimization in [3], observe that
disjoint S-nodes are never in the same inference, and
thus we can replace the equation for edges by:

( v)
ce

=

c(ve)
k(ev)

(3)

where k(ev) is the number of consistent immediate
support paths. Specifically, if v is an S-node, then
k(ev) = 1 since there is only one outgoing edge from
an S-node. If v is an I-node, k( ev) is the number of
consistent 1-nodes immediately supported by S-nodes
that are children of v.1 As for WAODAGs, we have
for sets of edges:

c(C)

=

L c(e)

(4)

eEC
1This number should be an upper bound on the number
of edges outgoing from v that are in any inference. It may
be possible to get a tighter bound in some cases, and if so
that bound can be used in place of k( e").

Cost-Sharing in Bayesian Knowledge Bases

It is by no means clear whether these equations are suf­
ficient to uniquely define the cost function. However,
treating equations 2, 3, 4 as a system of equations in
the variables c( v ), c( e) with v E V, e E E rather than
a definition, we can refer to solutions of the system.
Henceforth, we will denote by c an arbitrary solution
to equations 2, 3, 4, whenever unambiguous. We will
show that an arbitrary solution c to the system (hence­
forth called a cost-sharing solution) is an admissible
heuristic, by extending the proof of [ 3].

Consider the knowledge graph in figure 3. The follow­
ing values can be computed immediately: c((sl, il))

we could now set (temporarily), c(i2)

we get the edge cost c((i2, s2)) = 2.5, since i2 has two

causes re-evaluation to proceed indefinitely, until even­

Theorem 1 Any cost-sharing solution c is an admis­

sible heuristic for BKBs.
Proof outline: we first note that while the BKB is a
graph with cycles, an inference is acyclic, and corre­
sponds to an AND-DAG. A cut of an inference is de­
fined exactly as for an AND-DAG in [3]: a minimal set
of edges that any path from the evidence to the leaves
must intersect. As in WAODAGs, we define a cut of
the BKB as a cut of some BKB inference.
Now, we proceed with the same proof as in [3]. All
steps of the proof are the same, it does not matter
that we have cycles, as the cycles only serve to further
decrease c, and thus it is still an underestimate of the
true weight.
The remaining problems are with applying the
WAODAG expansion operator Sr, which requires a
topological sort T of the DAG. Since we have cycles,
this is no longer possible. We must guarantee that
once the we apply the expansion operator at a node,
its outgoing edges will not be used anymore. To do
that, we modify the expansion operator as follows. A
state s is a set of edges and a set of deleted edges. Our
expansion operator S, applied at node n is the same
as Sr, except that when S is applied at node n, the
edges En are added to the set of deleted edges. A state
which contains a deleted edge is illegal, and discarded.
In order that all possible inferences be reachable, it is
not sufficient to apply the expansion according to a
topological ordering. If S is applied, at each state, at
all nodes where there is some en in the current set of
edges, reachability is maintained. 0
We now address the problem of computing a solution
c(v). Clearly, the seemingly obvious solution of using
the equations directly will not help: some values will
be undefined initially. One could think of a scheme
that, to compute a minimum over several terms, some
defined and some not, just takes the minimum over the
currently defined terms, and propagates the resulting
value. If every node participates in some inference,
such a scheme is guaranteed to assign a cost value at
each node eventually. However, in order to have all
equations satisfied, it may be necessary to update cost
values already derived, for example, due to finding a
lower value than already used before, at an 1-node. It
turns out that such a scheme may loop indefinitely, as
the following example shows.

tually (in the limit of an infinite number of loops,
or i n practice determined by computational numeri­
cal accuracy) we get convergence at: c(il) = c(i2) =

c(s2) = c(s3) = 2, c((il, s2)) = c((il, s3)) = 1, and
c(i3) = c((s5, i3)) = c(s5) = 3. Not e further that the

costs we get reflect an illegal, cyclic inference, but since

we need an underestimate in order to get an admissible
heuristic, this is not a problem.
Solving the system of equations efficiently is non­
trivial. In fact, if we had max functions in addition
to the min functions, or if the summation included
negative terms, it would be easy to show that the prob­
lem of finding a solution is NP-hard (and deciding the
existence of a solution is NP-complete). However, in
our case , we can use linear programming techniques to
derive a solution, by transforming the equations to a
linear system, as follows. For each node and edge, we
have a variable, which for convenience we denote by
the same name. Linear equations are left as they are.
Minimization equations are translated as follows:

An optimal solution c* to the above linear program can
be found using standard linear programming methods,
such as the simplex method [6]. A solution always ex­

a unique, not necessarily optimal, solution to the equa­
tions and inequalities.

Theorem 2 Let c• be an optimal solution to the lin­
. ear program. Then c* is also a solution to the cost­
sharing equation system (equations 2, 3, 4).
Proof: Let c* be an optimal solution to the linear pro­
gram. Assume that c* violates some of equations 2,
3, 4. Since the linear linear program equations are
the same as equations 2, 3, 4, except that minimiza­
tion was replaced by inequalities, only equations of the
form:
c(v ) = min c( ev)
e ,eE.

426

can be violated. Let v be a variable (node) where the
above equation is violated. Then, since the linear pro­
gram enforces c*(v ) S c* (ev ) for all eu E Ev, then it
must be the case that for this variable, c*(v) < c• (ev)
for all ev E Eu (otherwise it will indeed be the min­
imum, thus not violating the equation). Define R to
be the set of nodes consisting of v and its immediate
descendents (all immediate descendents are S-nodes),

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

In applying the cost-sharing heuristic, we actually use
a simplified linear program, as follows. First, whenever
an 1-node v has only a single parent, we use c( v ) =
c( ev ) rather than the inequality. We also cancel out
all edge cost variables by substituting them according
to equations (3, 4). Finally, we can also cancel out by
substitution all the S-node costs (noting that S-nodes
all have only one child), to get a system of inequalities
just for the 1-node costs. For !-nodes with more than
one parent, we get:

If 8 is consistent (does not contain any
pair of 1-nodes from the same cell in the
partition), insert it into the agenda.

For example, let us trace the algorithm as run on the
BKB fragment of figure 3, with i3 being the evidence.

Cost-Sharing in Bayesian Knowledge Bases

The heuristic costs are computed as shown in the pre­
vious section. The strongly connected components are
{il, i2} and { i3}. The starting state, So, contains just
the dummy edge (i3, *). Search proceeds as shown in
table 1, where "Pop" is the ID of the popped state. For
lack of space, the dummy edges (*,i5),(*,s2),(*,s3)
are missing from the table, but this should not ad­
versely affect clarity.
In the actual implementation, several details should be
observed. First, instead of maintaining a list of deleted
edges, it is sufficient, and more efficient, to treat any
edge outgoing from an expanded node as if it were a
deleted edge, and maintain a list of expanded I-nodes.
Second, the fact that S-nodes are all AND nodes with
a single outgoing edge is used to save some time: once
an edge outgoing from an S-node is picked, we are
forced to select all the incoming edges into the S-node
anyway, so we do all that in one expansion step, and
do not keep track of expanded S-nodes.

Results are depicted in Figures 5, 6 using log-scale of
time to solution and number of expansion steps, re­
spectively for the Y axis (X axis is just the number
of the problem instance, and thus essentially meaning­
less here). Times for cost-sharing include initialization
of the heuristic costs. The cases labeled cost-so-far
(failed) are those taking 2000 seconds without reach­
ing a solution, or crashing due to lack of swap space.
Figure 7 plots total number of problems solved vs. to­
tal CPU time. Cost-sharing does better than cost-so­
far by at least one order of magnitude. Finding several
best solutions is also useful [9]. A timing comparison
for the 10 best solutions is depicted in Figure 8.
These preliminary experiments suggest that cost­
sharing is an extremely useful search heuristic for
graphs with cycles, as well as directed acyclic graphs.
We know of no other heuristics for this search prob­
lem. Nor is it clear how one would apply schemes
such as clustering to BKBs, and even if they could, a
strongly-connected component size of over 40 for most
of the problem instances in the experiments suggest
that the clique size would be too large to handle by
such schemes. Thus, heuristic search with cost-sharing
appears to be the only viable method for BKBs not in
one of the (topologically) easier classes of problems.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The above algorithm was tested on several BKB's pro­
duced from an available acyclic BKB for reasoning
about raising gold-fish. The network has 165 !-nodes
and 350 S-nodes. Cycles were introduced by random
reversal of several arc pairs. Evidence selection was
also random. Runtime and number of expansion steps
(iterations through step 4 of the algorithm) were com­
pared between a search algorithm using cost-sharing
and one using cost-so-far. The program was imple­
mented in C++, and run on a SPARC-10.

WAODAG search heuristic, the cost-sharing heuristic
(3], to apply to BKBs. The adaptation is non-trivial
due to the fact that the heuristic as-is, is undefined for
cyclic graphs. Additionally, it is non-trivial to com­
pute the modified heuristic efficiently.
Having successfully modified the cost-sharing heuris­
tic to BKBs, we showed empirically that the heuristic
saves considerable search effort in several BKBs which

is a toy version of an application domains: raising gold­
fish. In addition to using the suggested algorithm and
heuristic for BKB reasoning henceforth, it may be pos­
sible to use the scheme for reasoning in other models
with cycles, such as reasoning in chain graphs or the
model presented in
