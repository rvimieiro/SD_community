Abstract

We describe a graphical representation of
probabilistic relationships-an alternative to
the Bayesian network-called a dependency
network. Like a Bayesian network, a depen­
dency network has a graph and a probabil­
ity component. The graph component is a
(cyclic) directed graph such that a node's
parents render that node independent of all
other nodes in the network. The probabil­
ity component consists of the probability of
a node given its parents for each node (as in
a Bayesian network) . We identify several ba­
sic properties of this representation, and de­
scribe its use in collaborative filtering (the
task of predicting preferences) and the visu­
alization of predictive relationships.

Introduction

The Bayesian network has proven to be a valuable tool
for encoding, learning, and reasoning about probabilis­
tic relationships. In this paper, we introduce another
graphical representation of such relationships called
a dependency network. The representation can be
thought of as a collection of regression/classification
models among variables in a domain that can be com­
bined using Gibbs sampling to define a joint distribu­
tion for that domain. The dependency network has
several advantages and disadvantages with respect to
the Bayesian network. For example, a dependency net­
work is not useful for encoding causal relationships and
is difficult to construct using a knowledge-based ap­
proach. Nonetheless, in our three years of experience
with this representation, we have found it to be easy to

learn from data and quite useful for encoding and dis­
playing predictive (i.e., dependence and independence)
relationships. In addition, we have empirically verified
that dependency networks are well suited to the task of
predicting preferences-a task often referred to as col­
laborative filtering. Finally, the representation shows
promise for density estimation and probabilistic infer­
ence.
The representation was conceived independently by
Hofmann and Tresp (1997), who used it for density es­
timation; and Hofmann (2000) investigated several of
its theoretical properties. In this paper, we summarize
their work, further investigate theoretical properties of
the representation, and examine its use for collabora­
tive filtering and data visualization.
In Section 2, we define the representation and describe
several of its basic properties. In Section 3, we de­
scribe algorithms for learning a dependency network
from data, concentrating on the case where the local
distributions of a dependency network (similar to the
local distributions of a Bayesian network) are encoded
using decision trees.
In Section 4, we describe the
task of collaborative filtering and present an empirical
study showing that dependency networks are almost
as accurate as and computationally more attractive
than Bayesian networks on this task. Finally, in Sec­
tion 5, we show how dependency networks are ideally
suited to the task of visualizing predictive relationships
learned from data.

Dependency Networks

To describe dependency networks and how we learn
them, we need some notation. We denote a variable
by a capitalized token (e.g., X, X;, 0, Age), and the
state or value of a corresponding variable by that same
token in lower case (e.g., x, x;, 8, age). We denote a
set of variables by a bold-face capitalized token (e.g.,
X, X;, Pa;). We use a corresponding bold-face lower­
case token (e.g., x, x;, pa;) to denote an assignment of

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

state or value to each variable in a given set. We use
p(X xiY = y) (or p(xiy) as a shorthand) to denote
the probability that X = x given Y = y. We also
use p (x iy) to denote the probability distribution for X
given Y (both mass functions and density functions).
Whether p(xiy) refers to a probability, a probability
density, or a probability distribution will be clear from
context.
=

Consider a domain of interest having variables X =
(X1 , ... , Xn ) . A dependency network for X is a pair
(9, P) where q is a (cyclic) directed graph and P is a
set of probability distributions. Each node in q corre­
sponds to a variable in X. We use X; to refer to both
the variable and its corresponding node. The parents
of node X;, denoted Pa;, correspond to those variables
Pa; that satisfy
(1)
The distributions in P are the local probability distributions p (x; j p a; ), i = 1, . . . , n. We do not require
the distributions p ( x; x1, ...,Xi-1,Xi+1, ..., xn) , i =
1, .. . , n to be obtainable (via inference) from a sin­
gle joint distribution p(x). If they are, we say that the
dependency network is consistent with p (x). We shall
say more about the issue of consistency later in this
section.

l

A Bayesian network for X defines a joint distribution
for X via the product of its local distributions. A
dependency network for X also defines a joint distri­
bution for X, but in a more complicated way via a
Gibbs sampler (e.g., Gilks, Richardson, and Spiegel­
halter, 1996). In this Gibbs sampler, we initial­
ize each variable to some arbitrary value. We then
repeatedly cycle through each variable X1 , ... , Xn,
in this order, and resample each X; according to
p(x;ix1, ...,Xi-1,Xi+1, ..., Xn) = p (x ; lp a; ). We call
this procedure an ordered Gibbs sampler. As described
by the following theorem (also proved in Hofmann,
2000), this ordered Gibbs sampler defines a joint dis­
tribution for X.
Theorem 1: An ordered Gibbs sampler applied to a
dependency network for X, where each X; is discrete
and each local distribution p ( x; IPa;) is positive, has a
unique stationary joint distribution for X.

Proof: Let be the sample of x after the
iteration
of the ordered Gibbs sampler. The sequence x1, x2, . . .
can be viewed as samples drawn from a homogenous
Markov chain with transition matrix M having ele­
ments Mjli = p ( xt+1 =
= i). (We use the termi­
nology of Feller, 1957.) It is not difficult to see that
M is the product M1
Mn, where Mk is the "lo­
cal" transition matrix describing the resampling of Xk

according to the local distribution p(xk IPak)· The pos­
itivity of local distributions guarantees the positivity
of M, which in turn guarantees (1) the irreducibility
of the Markov chain and (2) that all of the states are
ergodic. Consequently, there exists a unique joint dis­
tribution that is stationary with respect to M. 0
Because the Markov chain described in the proof is
irreducible and ergodic, after a sufficient number of
iterations, the samples in the chain will be drawn from
the stationary distribution for X. Consequently, these
samples can be used to estimate this distribution.
Note that the Theorem holds for both consistent and
inconsistent dependency networks. Furthermore, the
restriction to discrete variables can be relaxed, but
will not be discussed here. In the remainder of this
paper, we assume all variables are discrete and each
local distribution is positive.
In addition to determining a joint distribution, a de­
pendency network for a given domain can be used
to compute any conditional distribution of interest­
that is, perform probabilistic inference. We discuss
an algorithm for doing so, which uses Gibbs sampling,
in Heckerman, Chickering, Meek, Rounthwaite, and
Kadie (2000). That Gibbs sampling is used for in­
ference may appear to be a disadvantage of depen­
dency networks with respect to Bayesian networks.
When we learn a Bayesian network from data, how­
ever, the resulting structures are typically complex and
not amenable to exact inference. In such situations,
Gibbs sampling (or even more complicated Monte­
Carlo techniques) are used for inference in Bayesian
networks, thus weakening this potential advantage.
In fact, when we have data and can learn a model
for X, dependency networks have an advantage over
Bayesian networks. Namely, we can learn each local
distribution in a dependency network independently,
without regard to acyclicity constraints.
Bayesian networks have one clear advantage over de­
pendency networks. In particular, dependency net­
works are not suitable for the representation of causal
relationships. For example, if X causes Y (so that
X and Y are dependent), the corresponding depen­
dency network is X +-+ Y -that is, X is a parent of Y
and vice versa. It follows that dependency networks
are difficult to elicit directly from experts. Without
an underlying causal interpretation, knowledge-based
elicitation is cumbersome at best.
Another important observation about dependency net­
works is that, when we learn one from data as
we have described-learning each local distribution
independently-the model is likely to be inconsistent.
(In an extreme case, where (1) the true joint distribu-

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

266

tion lies in one of the possible models, (2) the model
search procedure finds the true model, and (3) we
have essentially an infinite amount of data, the learned
model will be consistent.) A simple approach to avoid
this difficulty is to learn a Bayesian network and apply
inference to that network to construct the dependency
network. This approach, however, will eliminate the
advantage associated with learning dependency net­
works just described, is likely to be computationally
inefficient, and may produce extremely complex local
distributions. When ordered Gibbs sampling is applied
to an inconsistent dependency network, it is important
to note that the joint distribution so defined will de­
pend on the order in which the Gibbs sampler visits
the variables. For example, consider the inconsistent
dependency network X +- Y. If we draw sample-pairs
(x, y)-that is, x and then y-then the resulting sta­
tionary distribution will have X and Y independent.
In contrast, if we draw sample-pairs (y, x), then the
resulting stationary distribution may have X and Y
dependent.
The fact that we obtain a joint distribution from any
dependency network, consistent or not, is comforting.
A more important question, however, is what distri­
bution do we get? The following theorem, proved in
Heckerman et al. (2000), provides a partial answer.
Theorem 2: If a dependency network for X is con­
sistent with a positive distribution
then the sta­
tionary distribution defined in Theorem 1 is equal to

p(x),

p(x).

When a dependency network is inconsistent, the situa­
tion is even more interesting. If we start with learned
local distributions that are only slight perturbations
(in some sense) of the true local distributions, will
Gibbs sampling produce a joint distribution that is a
slight perturbation of the true joint distribution? Hof­
mann (2000) argues that, for discrete dependency net­
works with positive local distributions, the answer to
this question is yes when perturbations are measured
with an L2 norm. In addition, Heckerman et al. (2000)
show empirically using several real datasets that the
joint distributions defined by a Bayesian network and
dependency network, both learned from data, are sim­
ilar.
We close this section with several facts about consis­
tent dependency networks, proved in Heckerman et al.
(2000). We say that a dependency network for X is
bi-directional if X; is a parent of Xj if and only if Xj is
a parent of X; , for all X; and Xj in X. We say that a
distribution
is consistent with a dependency net­
work structure if there exists a consistent dependency
network with that structure that defines

p(x)

p(x).

Theorem 3: The set of positive distributions consis­
tent with a dependency network structure is equal to
the set of positive distributions defined by a Markov­
network structure with the same adjacencies.
Note that, although dependency networks and Markov
networks define the same set of distributions, their rep­
resentations are quite different. In particular, the de­
pendency network includes a collection of conditional
distributions, whereas the Markov network includes a
collection of joint potentials.
Let pa{ be the lh parent of node X; . A consistent de­
pendency network is minimal if and only if, for every
node X; and for every parent pa{ , X; is not indepen­
dent of pa{ given the remaining parents of X; .
Theorem 4: A minimal consistent dependency net­
work for a positive distribution
must be bi­
directional.

Learning Dependency Networks

In this section, we mention a few important points
about learning dependency networks from data.
When learning a dependency network for X, each local
distribution for X; is simply a regression/classification
model (with feature selection) for x; with X\ {xi} as
inputs. If we assume that each local distribution has
a parametric model p( x; !Pa;, B;), and ignore the de­
pendencies among the parameter sets Bt, ..., ()n, then
we can learn each local distribution independently us­
ing any regression/classification technique for mod­
els such as a generalized linear model, a neural net­
work, a support-vector machine, or an embedded re­
gression/classification model (Heckerman and Meek,
1997). From this perspective, the dependency network
can be thought of as a mechanism for combining re­
gression/classification models via Gibbs sampling to
determine a joint distribution.
In the work described in this paper, we use decision
trees for the local distributions. A good discussion of
methods for learning decision trees is given in Breiman,
Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (1984). We learn a deci­
sion tree using a simple hill-climbing approach in con­
junction with a Bayesian score as described in Fried­
man and Goldszmdit (1996) and Chickering, Hecker­
man, and Meek (1997). To learn a decision tree for
X; , we initialize the search algorithm with a single­
ton root node having no children. Then, we replace
each leaf node in the tree with a binary split on some
variable Xj in X\ X; , until no such replacement in­
creases the score of the tree. Our binary split on Xj is

267

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

a decision-tree node with two children: one of the chil­
dren corresponds to a particular value of Xj, and the
other child corresponds to all other values of Xj. Our
Bayesian scoring function uses a uniform prior distri­
bution for all decision-tree parameters, and a structure
prior proportional to KJ, where K > 0 is a tunable pa­
rameter and f is the number of free parameters in the
decision tree. In studies that predated those described
in this paper, we have found that the setting K = 0.01
yields accurate models over a wide variety of datasets.
We use this same setting in our experiments.
For comparison in these experiments, we also learn
Bayesian networks with decision trees for local distri­
butions using the algorithm described in Chickering,
Heckerman, and Meek (1997). When learning these
networks, we use the same parameter and structure
priors used for dependency networks.
We conclude this section by noting an interesting fact
about the decision-tree representation of local distri­
butions. Namely, there will be a split on variable X
in the decision tree for Y if and only if there is an
arc from X to Y in the dependency network that in­
cludes these variables. As we shall see in Section 5,
this correspondence helps the visualization of data.

Collaborative Filtering

In the remainder of this paper, we consider useful ap­
plications of dependency networks, whether they be
consistent or not.
The first application is collaborative filtering ( CF), the
task of predicting preferences. Examples of this task
include predicting what movies a person will like based
on his or her ratings of movies seen, predicting what
new stories a person is interested in based on other
stories he or she has read, and predicting what web
pages a person will go to next based on his or her
history on the site. Another important application in
the burgeoning area of e-commerce is predicting what
products a person will buy based on products he or
she has already purchased and/or dropped into his or
her shopping basket.
Collaborative filtering was introduced by Resnick, la­
covou, Suchak, Bergstrom, and Riedl (1994) as both
the task of predicting preferences and a class of al­
gorithms for this task. The class of algorithms they
described was based on the informal mechanisms peo­
ple use to understand their own preferences. For ex­
ample, when we want to find a good movie, we talk
to other people that have similar tastes and ask them
what they like that we haven't seen. The type of algo­
rithm introduced by Resnik et al. (1994), sometimes
called a memory-based algorithm, does something simi-

lar. Given a user's preferences on a series of items, the
algorithm finds similar users in a database of stored
preferences. It then returns some weighted average of
preferences among these users on items not yet rated
by the original user.
As done in Breese, Heckerman, and Kadie (1998),
let us concentrate on the application of collaborative
filtering-that is, preference prediction. In their pa­
per, Breese et al. (1998) describe several CF sce­
narios, including binary versus non-binary preferences
and implicit versus explicit voting. An example of
explicit voting would be movie ratings provided by a
user. An example of implicit voting would be know­
ing only whether a person has or has not purchased
a product. Here, we concentrate on one scenario im­
portant for e-commerce: implicit voting with binary
preferences-for example, the task of predicting what
products a person will buy, knowing only what other
products they have purchased.
A simple approach to this task, described in Breese et
al. (1998), is as follows. For each item (e.g., prod­
uct), define a variable with two states corresponding
to whether or not that item was preferred (e.g., pur­
chased). We shall use "0" and "1" to denote not
preferred and preferred, respectively. Next, use the
dataset of ratings to learn a Bayesian network for the
joint distribution of these variables X= (X1, ..., Xn)·
The preferences of each user constitutes a case in the
learning procedure. Once the Bayesian network is
constructed, make predictions as follows. Given a
new user's preferences x, use the Bayesian network
to determine p(Xi = 1lx \ Xi = 0) for each prod­
uct Xi not purchased. That is, infer the probability
that the user would have purchased the item had we
not known he did not. Then, return a list of recom­
mended products-among those that the user did not
purchase-ranked by this probability.
Breese et al. (1998) show that this approach out­
performs memory-based and cluster-based methods
on several implicit rating datasets. Specifically, the
Bayesian-network approach was more accurate and
yielded faster predictions than did the other methods.
What is most interesting about this algorithm in the
context of this paper is that only the probabilities
p(X; = 1lx \X; = 0) are needed to produce the recom­
mendations. In particular, these probabilities may be
obtained by a direct lookup in a dependency network:
p(Xi

=

1lx \X;= 0)

=

p(Xi

=

1lpa; )

(2)

where pai is the instance of Pai consistent with X.
Thus, dependency networks are a natural model on
which to base CF predictions. In the remainder of
this section, we compare this approach with that based

We evaluated Bayesian networks and dependency net­
works on three datasets: (1) Nielsen, which records
whether or not users watched five or more minutes of
network TV shows aired during a two-week period in
1995 (made available courtesy of Nielsen Media Re­
search), (2) MS. COM, which records whether or not
users of microsoft.com on one day in 1996 visited ar­
eas "vroots" ) of the site (available on the Irvine Data
Mining Repository), and (3) MSNBC, which records
whether or not visitors to MSNBC on one day in 1998
read stories among the most popular 1001 stories on
the site. The MSNBC dataset contains 20,000 users
sampled at random from the approximate 600,000
users that visited the site that day. In a separate anal­
ysis on this dataset, we found that the inclusion of ad­
ditional users did not produce a substantial increase
in accuracy. Table 4.1 provides additional information
about each dataset. All datasets were partitioned into
training and test sets at random.

4.2

Evaluation Criteria and Experimental
Procedure

We have found the following three criteria for collab­
orative filtering to be important: (1) the accuracy of
the recommendations, (2) prediction time-the time
it takes to create a recommendation list given what
is known about a user, and (3) the computational re­
sources needed to build the prediction models. We
measure each of these criteria in our empirical com­
parison. In the remainder of this section, we describe
our evaluation criterion for accuracy.
Our criterion attempts to measure a user's expected
utility for a list of recommendations. Of course, dif­
ferent users will have different utility functions. The
measure we introduce provides what we believe to be
a good approximation across many users.
The scenario we imagine is one where a user is shown

a ranked list of items and then scans that list for pre­
ferred items starting from the top. At some point, the
denote
user will stop looking at more items. Let
the probability that a user will examine the kth item
on a recommendation list before stopping his or her
scan, where the first position is given by k= 0. Then,
a reasonable criterion is

p(k)

cfaccuracyt (list)=

LP(k) c5k
k

(3)

where c5k is 1 if the item at position k is preferred and 0
otherwise. To make this measure concrete, we assume
that p(k) is an exponentially decaying function:

p(k)= Tk/a

(4)

where a is the "half-life" position-the position at
which an item will be seen with probability 0.5. In
our experiments, we use a= 5.
In one possible implementation of this approach, we
could show recommendations to a series of users
and ask them to rate them as "preferred" or "not
preferred" .
We could then use the average of
cfaccuarcy1 (list) over all users as our criterion. Be­
cause this method is extremely costly, we instead use
an approach that uses only the data we have. In par­
ticular, as already described, we randomly partition a
dataset into a training set and a test set. Each case
in the test set is then processed as follows. First, we
randomly partition the user's preferred items into in­
put and measurement sets. The input set is fed to the
CF model, which in turn outputs a list of recommen­
dations. Finally, we compute our criterion as
N

100 "'"' Lk cS;k
.
cfaccuracy(hst) =
K 1
N L...
i=l L:k,;,;

p(k)
p(k)

(5)

where N is the number of users in the test set, K; is
the number of preferred items in the measurement set
for user i, and c5;k is 1 if the kth item in the recommen­
dation list for user i is preferred in the measurement
set and 0 otherwise. The denominator in Equation 5
is a per-user normalization factor. It is the utility of a
list where all preferred items are at the top. This nor­
malization allows us to more sensibly combine scores
across measurement sets of different size.
We performed several experiments reflecting differing
numbers of ratings available to the CF engines. In the
first protocol, we included all but one of the preferred
items in the input set. We term this protocol all but 1.
In additional experiments, we placed 2, 5, and 10 pre­
ferred items in the input sets. We call these protocols
given 2, given 5, and given 10.
The all but 1 experiments measure the algorithms' per­
formance when given as much data as possible from

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

each test user. The various given experiments look at
users with less data available, and examine the perfor­
mance of the algorithms when there is relatively little
known about an active user. When running the given
m protocols, if an input set for a given user had less
than m preferred items, the case was eliminated from
the evaluation. Thus the number of trials evaluated
under each protocol varied.

Table 2 shows the accuracy of recommendations for
Bayesian networks and dependency networks across
the various protocols and three datasets. For a com­
parison, we also measured the accuracy of recommen­
dation lists produced by sorting items on their overall
popularity, p(X; = 1). The accuracy of this approach
is shown in the row labeled "Baseline." A score in
boldface corresponds to a significantly significant win­
ner. We use ANOVA (e.g., McClave and Dietrich,
1988) with a = 0.1 to test for statistical significance.
When the difference between two scores in the same
column exceed the value of RD (required difference),
the difference is significant.

The magnitudes of accuracy differences, however, are
not that large. In particular, the ratio of ( cfac­
curacy(BN) - cfaccuracy(DN)) to (cfaccuracy(BN) cfaccuracy(Baseline)) averages 4 ± S percent across the
datasets and protocols.

Results

From the table, we see that Bayesian networks are
more accurate than dependency networks. This re­
sult is interesting, because there are reasons to ex­
pect that dependency networks will be more accurate
than Bayesian networks and vice versa. On the one
hand, the search process that learns Bayesian net­
works is constrained by acyclicity, suggesting that de­
pendency networks may be more accurate. On the
other hand, the conditional probabilities used to sort
the recommendations are inferred from the Bayesian
network, but learned directly in the dependency net­
work. Therefore, dependency networks may be less
accurate, because they waste data in the process of
learning what could otherwise be inferred. For this
or perhaps other reasons, the Bayesian networks are
more accurate.

Data Visualization

Bayesian networks are well known to be useful for
visualizing causal relationships. In many circum­
stances, however, analysts are only interested in
predictive-that is, dependency and independency­
relationships. In our experience, the directed-arc se­
mantics of Bayesian networks interfere with the visu­
alization of such relationships.
As a simple example, consider the Bayesian network
X --+ Y. Those familiar with the semantics of
Bayesian networks immediately recognize that observ­
ing Y helps to predict X. Unfortunately, the untrained
individual will not. In our experience, this person will
interpret this network to mean that only X helps to
predict Y, and not vice versa. Even people who are
expert in d-separation semantics will sometimes have
difficulties visualizing predictive relationships using a
Bayesian network. The cognitive act of identifying a
node's Markov blanket seems to interfere with the vi­
sualization experience.
Dependency networks are a natural remedy to this

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000

270

problem. If there is no arc from X to Y in a depen­
dency network, we know immediately that X does not
help to predict Y.

Figure 1 shows a dependency network learned from
a dataset obtained from Media Metrix. The dataset
contains demographic and internet-use data for about
5,000 individuals during the month of January 1997.
On first inspection of this network, an interest­
ing observation becomes apparent: there are many
(predictive) dependencies among demographics, and
many dependencies among frequency-of-use, but there
are few dependencies between demographics and
frequency-of-use.
Over the last three years, we have found numerous
interesting dependency relationships across a wide va­
riety of datasets using dependency networks for visu­
alization. In fact, we have given dependency networks
this name because they have been so useful in this
regard.
The network in Figure 1 is displayed in DNViewer,
a dependency-network visualization tool developed at
Microsoft Research. The tool allows a user to display
both the dependency-network structure and the de­
cision tree associated with each variable. Navigation
between the views is straightforward. To view a de­
cision tree for a variable, a user simply double clicks
on the corresponding node in the dependency network.
Figure 2 shows the tree for Shopping.Freq.
An inconsistent dependency net learned from data of­
fers an additional advantage for visualization. If there
is an arc from X to Y in such a network, we know that
X is a significant predictor of Y -significant in what­
ever sense was used to learn the network. Under this
interpretation, a uni-directional link between X and Y
is not confusing, but rather informative. For example,
in Figure 1, we see that Sex is a significant predictor
of Socioeconomic status, but not vice versa-an in­
teresting observation. Of course, when making such
interpretations, one must always be careful to recog­
nize that statements of the form "X helps to predict
Y" are made in the context of the other variables in
the network.
In DNViewer, we enhance the ability of dependency
networks to reflect strength of dependency by includ­
ing a slider (on the left). As a user moves the slider
from bottom to top, arcs are added to the graph in the
order in which arcs are added to the dependency net­
work during the learning process. When the slider is
in its upper-most position, all arcs (i.e., all significant
dependencies) are shown.

data for about 5,000 individuals during the month of January 1997. The node labeled Overall.Freq represents
the overall frequency-of-use of the internet during this period. The nodes Search.Freq, Edu.Freq, and so on
represent frequency-of-use for various subsets of the internet.

Figure 3: The dependency network in Figure 1 with the slider set at half position.
Figure 3 shows the dependency network for the Media
Metrix data with the slider at half position. At this
setting, we find the interesting observation that the
dependencies between Sex and XXX.Freq (frequency
of hits to pornographic pages) are the strongest among
all dependencies between demographics and internet
use.

Summary and Future Work

We have described a new representation for probabilis­
tic dependencies called a dependency network. We
have shown that a dependency network (consistent
or not) defines a joint distribution for its variables,
and that models in this class are easy to learn from
data. In particular, we have shown how a dependency
network can be thought of as a collection of regres­
sion/classification models among variables in a domain
that can be combined using Gibbs sampling to define
a joint distribution for the domain. In addition, we
have shown that this representation is useful for col­
laborative filtering and the visualization of predictive
relationships.
Of course, this research is far from complete. There
are many questions left to be answered. For example,

what are useful models (e.g., generalized linear models,
neural networks, support-vector machines, or embed­
ded regression/classification models) for a dependency
network's local distributions? Another example of par­
ticular theoretical interest is Hofmann's (2000) result
that small 12-norm perturbations in the local distribu­
tions lead to small 12-norm perturbations in the joint
distributions defined by the dependency network. Can
this result be extended to norms more appropriate for
probabilities such as cross entropy?
Finally, the dependency network and Bayesian net­
work can be viewed as two extremes of a spectrum.
The dependency network is ideal for situations where
the conditionals p(x;lx \ x;) are needed. In con­
trast, when we require the joint probabilities p(x),
the Bayesian network is ideal because these probabil­
ities may be obtained simply by multiplying condi­
tional probabilities found in the local distributions of
the variables. In situations where we need probabili­
ties of the form p(ylx\ y), where Y is a proper subset
of the domain X, we can build a network structure
that enforces an acyclicity constraint among only the
variables Y. In so doing, the conditional probabilities
p(ylx\ y) can be obtained by multiplication.
