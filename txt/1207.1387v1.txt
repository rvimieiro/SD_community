Abstract
We present a method for learning the parameters of a Bayesian network with prior knowledge
about the signs of influences between variables.
Our method accommodates not just the standard
signs, but provides for context-specific signs as
well. We show how the various signs translate
into order constraints on the network parameters
and how isotonic regression can be used to compute order-constrained estimates from the available data. Our experimental results show that
taking prior knowledge about the signs of influences into account leads to an improved fit of the
true distribution, especially when only a small
sample of data is available. Moreover, the computed estimates are guaranteed to be consistent
with the specified signs, thereby resulting in a
network that is more likely to be accepted by experts in its domain of application.

INTRODUCTION

For constructing a Bayesian network, often knowledge is
acquired from experts in its domain of application. Experience shows that domain experts can quite easily and reliably specify the graphical structure of a network [7], yet
tend to have more problems in coming up with the probabilities for its numerical part [8]. If data from every-day
problem solving in the domain is available therefore, one
would like to use these data for estimating the probabilities that are required for the graphical structure to arrive
at a fully specified network. For many applications, unfortunately, the available data sample is quite small, giving
rise to inaccurate estimates. The inaccuracies involved may
then lead to a reasoning behaviour of the resulting network
that violates common domain knowledge and the network
will not easily be accepted by experts in the domain.
While domain experts often are found to have difficulties in coming up with probability assessments, evidence

is building up that they feel more comfortable with providing qualitative knowledge about the probabilistic influences between the variables concerned [7, 11]. The qualitative knowledge provided by the domain experts, moreover,
tends to be more robust than their numerical assessments.
We demonstrated before that expert knowledge about the
signs of influences between the variables in a Bayesian network can be used to improve the probability estimates obtained from small data samples [9]. We now extend our
previous work to accommodate the wider range of contextspecific signs, and context-specific independences more
specifically. We argue that these signs impose order constraints on the probabilities required for the network. We
then show that the problem of estimating probabilities under these order constraints is a special case of isotonic regression. Building upon this property, we present an estimator that is guaranteed to produce probability estimates
that reflect the qualitative knowledge specified by the experts. The resulting network as a consequence is less likely
to exhibit counterintuitive reasoning behaviour and is more
likely to be accepted than a network with unconstrained estimates.
The paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we
briefly review qualitative influences. In section 3, we discuss isotonic regression and provide an algorithm for its
computation. We then show in section 4, that the problem of learning constrained network parameters is a special case of isotonic regression; we also discuss how the
different constraints that result from qualitative influences
are handled, and how the order constraints can be used in
a Bayesian context. In section 5, we report on experiments
that we performed on a small artificial Bayesian network
and on a real-life network in the medical domain. Finally,
we draw a number of conclusions from our work and indicate interesting directions for further research.

QUALITATIVE INFLUENCES

From a qualitative perspective, the variables in a Bayesian
network may be related in different ways. In the sequel

we assume all variables of the network to be binary. Let
X = (X1 , . . . , Xk ) be the parents of a variable Y , and
let Ω(X) = Ω(X1 ) × Ω(X2 ) × . . . × Ω(Xk ) = {0, 1}k
consist of vectors x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ) of values for the k
variables in X, that is, Ω(X) is the set of all parent configurations of Y . Slightly abusing terminology, we sometimes
say that Xi occurs or is present if it has the value one. We
write Xa for the sub-vector of X containing the variables
Xj for j ∈ a, where a is a subset of K = {1, . . . , k}. We
further write X−a for XK\a .
A qualitative influence [14] between two variables expresses how observing a value for the one variable affects
the probability distribution for the other variable. A positive influence of Xi on Y along an arc Xi → Y means that
the occurrence of Xi increases the probability that Y occurs, regardless of any other direct influences on Y , that is,
for all x, x0 ∈ Ω(X) with xi = 1, x0i = 0 and x−i = x0−i ,
we have p(y = 1|x) ≥ p(y = 1|x0 ). Similarly, there is
a negative influence of Xi on Y along an arc Xi → Y if
the occurrence of Xi decreases the probability that Y occurs, that is, for all x, x0 ∈ Ω(X) with xi = 1, x0i = 0 and
x−i = x0−i , we have p(y = 1|x) ≤ p(y = 1|x0 ). A pos+

itive influence of Xi on Y is denoted by Xi −→ Y and a
−
negative influence by Xi −→ Y . An influence with either
a positive or negative sign is called a signed influence. If
no sign is specified, we call the influence unsigned.
The idea of signs of influences is readily extended to include context-specific signs [12]. A positive influence of
Xi on Y within the context XC = c, C ⊆ {1, . . . , k} \ i,
means that whenever XC = c, the occurrence of Xi increases the probability that Y occurs, that is, for all x, x0 ∈
Ω(X) with xC = x0C = c, xi = 1, x0i = 0 and x−C∪{i} =
x0−C∪{i} , we have p(y = 1|x) ≥ p(y = 1|x0 ). A contextspecific negative influence is defined analogously. A zero
influence of Xi on Y within the context XC = c models
a local context-specific independence (cf. [2]), that is, for
all x, x0 ∈ Ω(X) with xC = x0C = c, xi = 1, x0i = 0 and
x−C∪{i} = x0−C∪{i} , we have p(y = 1|x) = p(y = 1|x0 ).
A signed context-specific influence of Xi on Y along an
s
arc Xi → Y is denoted by Xi −→ Y [XC = c], with
s ∈ {+, −, 0}. Note that ordinary signed influences are
special cases of context-specific influences with C = ∅.
Further note that a signed influence in essence specifies a
constraint on the parameters associated with a variable.
We assume, throughout the paper, that a domain expert provides the signs of the qualitative influences between the
variables in a network. We would like to mention that
for real-life applications these signs are quite readily obtained from experts by using a special-purpose elicitation
technique tailored to the acquisition of signs of qualitative
influences [11].

ISOTONIC REGRESSION

Our approach to obtaining parameter estimates for a
Bayesian network that satisfy the signs of the influences
specified by experts, is a special case of isotonic regression [13]. In this section we review isotonic regression in
general; in the next section we discuss its application to
parameter estimation for Bayesian networks.
Let Z = {z1 , z2 , . . . , zn } be a nonempty finite set of constants and let  be a quasi-order on Z, that is:
1. for all z ∈ Z: z  z (reflexivity), and
2. for all x, y, z ∈ Z : x  y, y  z ⇒ x  z
(transitivity).
Any real-valued function f on Z is isotonic with respect to
 if, for any z, z 0 ∈ Z, z  z 0 implies f (z) ≤ f (z 0 ). We
assume that each element zi of Z is associated with a real
number g(zi ); these real numbers typically are estimates of
the function values of an unknown isotonic function on Z.
Furthermore, each element of Z has associated a positive
weight w(zi ) that typically indicates the precision of this
estimate. An isotonic function g ∗ on Z now is an isotonic
regression of g with respect to the weight function w and
the order  if and only if it minimizes the sum
n
X

w(zi ) [f (zi ) − g(zi )]2

i=1

within the class of isotonic functions f on Z. The existence
of a unique g ∗ has been proven by Brunk [5].
Isotonic regression provides a solution to many statistical
estimation problems in which we have prior knowledge
about the order of the parameters to be estimated. For example, suppose that we want to estimate binomial parameters
p = (p(z1 ), p(z2 ), . . . , p(zn ))
where p(zi ) denotes the probability of success in population zi . Let ni denote the number of observations
sampled from population zi , and let the number of successes Yi in this sample be binomially distributed with
Yi ∼ B(ni , p(zi )). Then the isotonic regression of the
estimates Ȳi = Yi /ni with weights w(zi ) = ni provides
the maximum-likelihood estimate of p given that p is isotonic on (Z, ). Note that this example suggests that the
order-constrained estimates are obtained by first computing the unconstrained estimates and then performing the
isotonic regression of these basic estimates with appropriate weights.
Isotonic regression problems can be solved by quadratic
programming methods. Various dedicated algorithms, often restricted to a particular type of order, have been proposed as well. For Z linearly ordered, for example, the pool

adjacent violators (PAV) algorithm is well-known. For our
application, however, we require an algorithm that is applicable to sets of constants with arbitrary quasi-orders. For
this purpose we will use the minimum lower sets (MLS) algorithm proposed by Brunk [3]. The MLS algorithm builds
upon the concept of a lower set. A subset L of Z is a lower
set of Z if z ∈ L, z 0 ∈ Z, and z 0  z imply z 0 ∈ L.
The weighted average of a function g on Z for a nonempty
subset A is defined as
P
z∈A w(z)g(z)
Av(A) = P
z∈A w(z)
The algorithm now takes for its input the set of constants
Z = {z1 , z2 , . . . , zn } with quasi-order . With each
zi ∈ Z again is associated a weight w(zi ) and a real number g(zi ). The algorithm returns the isotonic regression g ∗
of g with respect to w and . The MLS algorithm resolves
violations of the order constraints by averaging over suitably chosen subsets of Z. For the final solution, it partitions the set Z into a number of subsets on which the isotonic regression is constant. The first subset B1 in the final
solution is a lower set of (Z, ). The second subset is a
lower set of (Z \ B1 , 2 ), where 2 is obtained from  by
removing all order relations involving elements of B1 . This
process is continued until Z is exhausted. In each iteration
the lower set with minimum weighted average is selected;
in case multiple lower sets attain the same minimum, their
union is taken.
MinimumLowerSets(Z, , g(z), w(z))
L = Collection of all lower sets of Z wrt 
Repeat S
B = {A ∈ L | Av(A) = minL∈L Av(L)}
For each z ∈ B do
g ∗ (z) = Av(B)
For each L ∈ L do
L=L\B
Z =Z \B
Until Z = ∅
Return g ∗

The bottleneck of the algorithm from a computational point
of view clearly is the generation of the lower sets, which is
exponential in the size of the set of constants. We return to
this observation in section 4.2.

PARAMETER LEARNING

In this section we address the maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters for a Bayesian network subject to the
constraints imposed by the signs of influences, and show
that it can be viewed as a special case of isotonic regression. We note that in the presence of signs, the parameters associated with the different parent configurations of
a variable are no longer unrelated. Only those combinations of parameter values that are isotonic with respect to

the quasi-order imposed by the specified signs, are feasible.
The parameters associated with different variables are still
unrelated however, because a sign imposes constraints on
the parameters for a single variable only. We restrict our attention therefore to the parameters associated with a single
variable.
4.1

ISOTONIC REGRESSION FORMULATION

To cast our problem of constrained parameter estimation
into the isotonic regression framework, we proceed as follows. For parents X of Y , we construct an order  on
Ω(X) in such a way that  corresponds to the order ≤ on
the parameters p(y = 1|x), x ∈ Ω(X), that is implied by
the specified signs. More specifically, for any qualitative
s
influence Xi −→ Y [XC = c], s ∈ {+, −, 0}, we impose
the following order on Ω(X): for all x, x0 ∈ Ω(X) with
xC = x0C = c, xi = 1, x0i = 0 and x−C∪{i} = x0−C∪{i} :
• if s = + then x0  x, since the positive sign implies
p(y = 1|x0 ) ≤ p(y = 1|x);
• if s = − then x  x0 , since the negative sign implies
p(y = 1|x) ≤ p(y = 1|x0 );
• if s = 0 then x  x0 and x0  x, since the zero
enforces the equality p(y = 1|x0 ) = p(y = 1|x).
The other ordering statements follow from the transitivity
and reflexivity properties of quasi-orders. The specified influences constrain the parameters p(y = 1|x) to be nondecreasing on (Ω(X), ).
Now suppose that we have available a data set D from
which we would like to estimate the parameters p(y =
1|x). The unconstrained maximum-likelihood estimate of
p(y = 1|x) is given by
p̂(y = 1|x) =

n(y = 1, x)
n(x)

where n(y = 1, x) denotes the number of observations in
D with y = 1 and X = x.
The following observation now links isotonic regression to
the problem currently considered: the isotonic regression
p∗ (y = 1|x) of p̂(y = 1|x) with weights w(x) = n(x)
provides the maximum-likelihood estimate of p(y = 1|x),
for all x ∈ Ω(X), subject to the constraint that these estimates must be non-decreasing on (Ω(X), ) ([4], see also
[13] page 32).
To illustrate the above observation, we consider a fragment
of a Bayesian network. Let X = (X1 , X2 , X3 ) be the parents of a variable Y , with qualitative influences on Y as
shown in figure 1. The fragment expresses the prior knowledge that X1 has a positive influence on Y and that, if X1
is absent, X3 has a negative influence on Y ; it further models that if X1 is present and X2 is absent, then X3 has no

thermore, the estimates in the second row should be equal,
due to the context-specific independence specified. Clearly,
this constraint is violated as well. Finally, the estimates
should be non-increasing in the first row, due to the contextspecific negative influence of X3 . This constraint is satisfied.

influence on Y . The network does not specify any prior
knowledge about the sign of the influence of X2 on Y .
Figure 2 shows the quasi-order on the parent configurations
that is imposed by the specified influences, where an arrow
from x to x0 indicates that x immediately precedes x0 in the
order. Because no influence of X2 on Y has been specified,
the parent configurations that have a different value for X2
are incomparable. As a consequence, the order consists of
two components, one for X2 = 0 and one for X2 = 1. Estimates may be computed for the two components separately,
because there are no order constraints between parent configurations contained in different components. Also note
that the component for X2 = 0, depicted in the left part of
figure 2, contains a cycle as a result of the context-specific
independence specified for X3 . Because of the independence the constraint p∗ (y = 1|1, 0, 0) = p∗ (y = 1|1, 0, 1)
must be satisfied. This is modelled by considering the two
parent configurations (1, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 1) as a single element in the ordering, as shown in figure 3.

Table 1 shows for each parent configuration with X2 = 0
the counts obtained from a given sample, as well as the associated maximum-likelihood estimates p̂(y = 1|x). We
note that the estimates should be non-decreasing in both
columns of the table, due to the positive influence of X1
on Y . This constraint is violated in the first column. Fur-

The MLS algorithm resolves the identified constraint violations by averaging the unconstrained estimates p̂(y = 1|x)
over conflicting cells from the table. It starts with the computation of the weighted average of p̂(y = 1|x) for all
lower sets of Ω(X); table 2 shows the resulting averages.
The minimum average is achieved by {(0, 0, 1)}, so the
algorithm sets p∗ (y = 1|0, 0, 1) = 1/5. This element
is removed from all lower sets, and their weighted averages are recomputed. Now {(0, 0, 0)} has the minimum
weighted average, and we get p∗ (y = 1|0, 0, 0) = 4/10.
The element (0, 0, 0) is removed from all lower sets, and
{(1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1)} is the only remaining lower set. Its
weighted average is 10/23, so the algorithm sets p∗ (y =
1|1, 0, 0) = p∗ (y = 1|1, 0, 1) = 10/23. Now the component of the order with X2 = 0 has been solved. Note that
the two constraint violations have been resolved simultaneously by averaging the pair of violators p̂(y = 1|1, 0, 0)
and p̂(y = 1|1, 0, 1).
Next we consider the parent configurations with X2 = 1.
Table 3 shows for each such parent configuration the counts
obtained from the available sample, and the associated
maximum-likelihood estimates p̂(y = 1|x). Note that there
are no observations in the sample with the parent configuration (0, 1, 1). In such cases we put p̂(y = 1|x) = 0.5 and
give the cell an arbitrary small weight. As a consequence
the estimate will the be dominated by other parameter estimates as soon as it is pooled to resolve conflicts.
From the specified signs, we have that the estimates should
be non-decreasing within each column, and non-increasing
in the first row. The row constraint is satisfied, but the
column constraints are not. Table 4 gives all lower sets
with X2 = 1, and their weighted averages. The set
{(0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1)} achieves the minimum and the MLS
algorithm sets p∗ (y = 1|0, 1, 1) = p∗ (y = 1|1, 1, 1) =
0.4. Note that the constrained estimate for the empty cell
(0, 1, 1) has simply been set equal to the estimate for the
conflicting cell (1, 1, 1). The elements (0, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 1)
are removed from all lower sets, and the weighted averages
(1,1,1)
are recomputed. Now the minimum weighted average of
12/25 = 0.48 is achieved by {(0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)}, so we
get p∗ (y = 1|0, 1, 0) = p∗ (y = 1|1, 1, 0) = 0.48. In this
step the violation of the order constraint in the first column
is resolved by averaging the parameter estimates for the two
conflicting cells. Note that the constrained joint estimate is
closer to the unconstrained estimate for cell (0, 1, 0) than
to the unconstrained estimate for cell (1, 1, 0) because we
have more observations in the former than in the latter and
the former thus has a larger associated weight.

We would also like to note that, although the algorithm
computes p∗ (y = 1|0, 1, 1) = 0.4 for the empty cell
(0, 1, 1), any value in the interval [0, 0.4] would actually
have satisfied the constraints. An alternative to the proposed procedure would be to remove the empty cells before
application of the MLS algorithm, and after the estimates
for the other cells have been computed, determine feasible
estimates for the empty cells.
Since Ω(X) is exhausted after this step, the algorithm halts.
We observe that the resulting parameter estimates indeed
satisfy the constraints imposed by the qualitative influences. Also note that the parameters that have not been involved in any constraint violations have retained their original estimates.
4.2

COMPLEXITY OF THE MLS ALGORITHM

We argued in section 3 that the number of lower sets is
the dominant factor in the runtime complexity of the minimum lower sets algorithm. To determine this number, we
start with the simple case where all k parents of a variable
have a context-independent signed influence. Without loss
of generality, we assume all signs to be positive. Since all
parents are binary, any parent configuration from Ω(X) is
uniquely determined by the parents that have the value 1, or
alternatively, by a subset of {1, 2, . . . , k}. The partial order
on Ω(X) is therefore isomorphic to the partial order generated by set inclusion on P({1, 2, . . . , k}). Every lower
set now corresponds uniquely to an antichain in this partial order. Hence, the number of distinct lower sets equals
the number of distinct nonempty antichains of subsets of a
k-set, which adheres to the well-known Sloane sequence

A014466. Writing |L(k)| for the number of lower sets
for k parents as above, we thus find that |L(5)| = 7580,
|L(6)| = 7828353, and |L(7)| = 2414682040997. We
conclude that the MLS algorithm is feasible for up to five
or six parents with signed influences only.
From our example network fragment, we noted that unsigned influences serve to partition the set of parent configurations Ω(X) into disjoint subsets, such that no element
of the one subset is order related to any element of the
other subsets. We argued that constrained estimates may be
computed for these subsets separately, thereby effectively
decomposing the parameter learning problem into a number of independent smaller problems. This decomposition
yields a considerable improvement of the efficiency of the
computations involved. In general, let k1 denote the number of parents with a signed influence and let k2 denote the
number of parents with an unsigned influence. The number
of configurations for the parents with an unsigned influence
equals 2k2 . The order graph thus consists of 2k2 components. The number of lower sets of the entire order is given
by
k2
|L(k1 + k2 )| = (|L(k1 )| + 1)2 − 1
This number grows very rapidly. For k1 = 4 and k2 =
3, for example, the algorithm would need to compute the
weighted average of 1688 −1 = 6.35×1017 lower sets. By
treating each component in the order as a separate problem,
the algorithm initially has to compute the weighted average
of
|L(k1 + k2 )| = 2k2 |L(k1 )|
lower sets. For k1 = 4 and k2 = 3, this amounts to just
8 · 167 = 1336 lower sets.
In the presence of context-specific signs, the analysis of
the algorithm’s runtime complexity becomes more complicated. We restrict ourselves to the following observations.
First, the absence of signs in particular contexts can also
lead to a decomposition of the order, and hence to a similar reduction of the computations involved as in the case
of unsigned influences. On the other hand, the absence of
signs in particular contexts can also lead to an increase of
the number of lower sets. Secondly, context-specific independences lead to a reduction of the number of elements
in the ordering, that is of the number of parameters to be
estimated, and hence to a reduction of the number of lower

sets.
4.3

MC

The parameter learning method described in the previous
sections does not require that an expert specifies numerical values for the parameters concerned. The expert only
has to provide signs for the various influences. Should uncertain prior knowledge about the numeric values of the
parameters be available in addition to knowledge about
the signs of influences, then we can accommodate this information. Suppose that the expert is willing to specify
a Beta prior for the parameters p(y = 1|x), x ∈ Ω(x).
We assume that he chooses the hyperparameters a(x) and
b(x) such that his experience is equivalent to having seen
the value y = 1 a total of a(x) − 1 times in h(x) =
a(x) + b(x) − 2 trials; h is called the prior precision.
Let p0 (y = 1|x) denote the modal value of p(y = 1|x),
that is, p0 (y = 1|x) is a priori considered the most likely
value of p(y = 1|x). We now further assume that the expert’s values for a(x) and b(x) are such that the modes
p0 (y = 1|x) = (a(x) − 1)/h(x), x ∈ Ω(X), are isotonic
with respect to the order imposed by the signs he specified.
In forming the joint prior for p(y = 1|x), x ∈ Ω(x), we assume local parameter independence (cf. [10]), except that
the parameter values must be isotonic. This means that the
prior density is 0 for non-isotonic value combinations for
the parameters, and proportional to the product Beta distribution for isotonic value combinations. The isotonic MAP
estimates then are given by the isotonic regression of
p0 (y = 1|x, D) =

n(x)p̂(y = 1|x) + h(x)p0 (y = 1|x)
n(x) + h(x)

with weights n(x) + h(x) (see [1]).
As before order-constrained estimation now amounts to
performing isotonic regression on basic estimates with appropriately chosen weights. The basic estimates are the unconstrained MAP estimates p0 (y = 1|x, D) for the parameters. The weight is n(x) + h(x), that is the sum of the
number of actual observations for parent configuration x
and the prior precision h(x) specified by the expert. Note
that in case of a flat prior (Beta(1,1); h = 0), the orderconstrained maximum likelihood estimates are returned.

To study the behaviour of the isotonic estimator in a slightly
more involved setting, we compare it to the standard
maximum-likelihood estimator on the well-known Brain
Tumour network [6]; the network and the signs of the influences are depicted in figure 4. For the network, we specified probabilities consistent with the constraints to generate
data samples for our experiments. Note that, even though
the true distribution satisfies the constraints, this need not

hold for the relative frequencies in the samples, especially
not for smaller sample sizes.
Our implementation first generates, for each variable, the
quasi-order on its parent configurations that corresponds
with the specified signs. For each order it finds the separate components; all parent configurations contained in the
same cycle are mapped to a single element and the order is
adjusted accordingly. For each component of the order, the
parameters for the parent configurations contained in that
component are estimated using the MLS algorithm.
We drew samples of various sizes from the network using
logic sampling; for each sample size, 100 data sets were
drawn. From each data set, both the standard maximumlikelihood estimates and the constrained estimates of the
network parameters were calculated. Given these parameter estimates, the joint distribution defined by the resulting
network was computed. This distribution then was compared to the true joint distribution defined by the original
network. For comparing the distributions, we used the
well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence. The KullbackLeibler divergence of Pr0 from Pr is defined as

The results are summarized in table 5, where Pr
denote the joint distribution that was obtained with unconstrained maximum-likelihood estimation. To illustrate the
benefits of modeling context-specific independences, we
first estimated the various parameters without taking the

was obtained with the isotone estimator using the embedded zeroes. The averages reported in the table were computed from those data sets for which the KL divergence
was smaller than infinity for the maximum-likelihood estimates: the isotone estimates always have KL divergence

smaller than infinity in these cases as well. The number
of data sets from which the averages were computed was
61, 97, 100, and 100 for sample sizes 50, 150, 500, and
1500, respectively. For sample sizes 20, 30, and 40, we
used Bayesian estimation with a Beta(2,2) prior for all parameters, that is, the prior mode of all parameters was set
to 0.5 with prior precision equal to 2. Note that by setting
all parameters to the same value we never violate any order
constraints. The unconstrained and isotonic MAP estimates
were used as point estimates for the parameters. We used
Bayesian estimation for the smallest sample sizes because
otherwise the KL divergence would almost always be equal
to infinity.
The results reveal that the isotonic estimator consistently
yields a better fit of the true distribution compared to the
unconstrained maximum-likelihood estimator, although the
differences are small. We note that for the smaller data
sets the differences are more marked than for the larger
data sets. This conforms to our expectations, since for
smaller data sets standard maximum-likelihood estimation
has a higher probability of yielding estimates that violate
the specified constraints. For larger data sets, the standard
estimator and the isotonic estimator are expected to often
result in the same estimates. Note that using the contextspecific independences gives an additional improvement of
fit, as was to be expected.
To conclude, we applied the isotonic estimator to a real-life
Bayesian network in the field of oncology. The O ESOCA
network provides for establishing the stage of a patient’s
oesophageal cancer, based upon the results of a number of
diagnostic tests. The network was constructed with the help
of gastroenterologists from the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis; the experts provided
the knowledge for the configuration of the network’s structure and also provided probability assessments for the network’s parameters. From the original O ESOCA network,
we constructed a binary network for our experiment, carefully building upon knowledge of the domain. The resulting network includes 40 variables with a total of 95 parameters. From values of the the various parameters, we established the signs for the qualitative influences between the
variables. The network includes 45 influences; figure 5 de-

The experimental results are displayed in table 6: Pr
denotes the joint distribution resulting from the unconstrained MAP estimates, and Pr∗ the joint distribution resulting from the isotonic MAP estimates. The results are
in line with the results obtained for the brain tumour network: the isotonic estimator is consistently better, and the
difference becomes smaller as the sample size increases.

CONCLUSIONS

Taking prior knowledge about the signs of influences between variables into account upon estimating the parameters of a Bayesian network, results in an improved fit of the
true distribution. The improvement is relatively large for
small samples, since these are more likely to give rise to
maximum-likelihood estimates that violate the constraints.
Since the constrained parameter estimates are in accordance with prior knowledge specified by experts, the resulting network is more likely to be accepted in its domain
of application.
An interesting extension of our method would be to allow
for non-binary variables with linearly-ordered discrete values. A signed influence on such a variable is defined in
terms of a stochastic order on the distributions given the
different parent configurations. Learning the parameters of
a network subject to the resulting constraints in our opinion
merits further research.
