Abstract
Causal discovery from observational data in
the presence of unobserved variables is challenging. Identification of so-called Y substructures is a sufficient condition for ascertaining some causal relations in the large
sample limit, without the assumption of no
hidden common causes. An example of a Y
substructure is A → C, B → C, C → D.
This paper describes the first asymptotically
reliable and computationally feasible scorebased search for discrete Y structures that
does not assume that there are no unobserved
common causes. For any parameterization
of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that has
scores with the property that any DAG that
can represent the distribution beats any DAG
that can’t, and for two DAGs that represent
the distribution, if one has fewer parameters than the other, the one with the fewest
parameter wins. In this framework there is
no need to assign scores to causal structures
with unobserved common causes. The paper
also describes how the existence of a Y structure shows the presence of an unconfounded
causal relation, without assuming that there
are no hidden common causes.

Introduction

Discovering causal relationships from observational
data is challenging due to the presence of observed confounders1 , particularly, hidden (latent) confounders.

A node W is said to be a confounder of nodes A and B
if there is a directed path from W to A and a directed path
from W to B that does not traverse A. If W is observed,
it is said to be a measured confounder, otherwise it is a
hidden confounder.

Furthermore, it is known that members of an independence (Markov) equivalence class of causal Bayesian
network (CBN) models are indistinguishable using
only probabilistic dependence and independence relationships among the observed variables.
There are several algorithms for reliably identifying
(some) causal effects in the large sample limit, given
the assumptions of acyclicity, and the Causal Markov
and Causal Faithfulness assumptions (explained below). Due to space limitations, we mention only two
representative algorithms here. The Greedy Equivalence Search (Chickering, 2002) is a score-based search
that reliably identifies some causal effects in the large
sample limit, but only under the additional assumption of no unobserved common causes. The FCI algorithm (Spirtes et al., 1999) reliably identifies some
causal effects in the large sample limit, but it is a
constraint-based search, and such methods have several important disadvantages relative to score-based
searches (Heckerman et al., 1999)—(1) the inability
to include prior belief in the form of structure probabilities, (2) the output is based on the significance
level used for the independence tests, and (3) there
is no quantification of the strength of the hypothesis
that is output. A constraint based search performs a
sequence of conditional independence tests. A single
conditional independence test may force the removal
of an edge, or a particular orientation, even if that
makes the rest of the model a poor fit. In contrast, a
score gives a kind of overall evaluation of how all the
conditional independence constraints are met by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and would not decrease
the overall fit to save one conditional independence.
A score based search over models that explicitly include hidden variables faces several difficult problems:
there are a potentially infinite number of such models, and there are both theoretical and computational
difficulties in calculating scores for models with hidden variables (Richardson & Spirtes, 2002). Another
approach is to use graphical models (mixed ances-

tral graphs) that represent the marginal distributions
of hidden variable models over the observed variables, but do not explicitly contain hidden variables
(Richardson & Spirtes, 2002). Mixed ancestral graph
models, unlike hidden variable models, are finite in
number, and in the linear case, there are no theoretical
or computational problems in scoring mixed ancestral
graphs. However, there is no currently known way to
score discrete mixed ancestral graphs, and there is no
known algorithm for efficiently searching the space of
mixed ancestral graphs. Finally, hidden variable models are known to entail non-conditional independence
constraints upon the marginal distribution; these constraints can be used to guide searches for hidden variable models that entail the constraints (Spirtes et al.,
1993; Tian & Pearl, 2002). However, no such computationally feasible search is known to be guaranteed
correct.

The search proposed here is the first computationally
feasible score-based search to reliably identify some
causal effects in the large sample limit for both discrete and linear models, without assuming that there
are no unobserved common causes, and without making any assumptions about the true causal structure
(other than acyclicity). There is also no need to assign
scores explicitly to causal structures with unobserved
common causes in this framework. We identify a class
of structures (Y structures) as “sufficient” for assigning causality, and provide the necessary theorems and
proofs for the claim. The proofs presented in this paper depend only upon two features of the score—(1)
a DAG that cannot represent a distribution loses in
the limit to one that can; and (2) if two DAGs with
different numbers of parameters can represent the distribution, the one with more parameters loses to the
DAG with fewer parameters.

Background

In this section we first introduce the CBN framework.
Subsequently, we define d-separation and
d-connectivity, independence equivalence, the causal
sufficiency assumption, the causal Markov condition,
and the causal Faithfulness condition. The following
notational convention will be used throughout the paper. Sets of variables are represented in bold and up-

2.1

Causal Bayesian network

A causal Bayesian network (CBN) is a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) with the vertices representing observed
variables in a domain and each arc is interpreted as a
direct causal influence between a parent node2 (variable) and a child node (Pearl, 1991). For example, if
there is a directed edge from A to B (A → B), node
A is said to exert a causal influence on node B. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of a hypothetical causal
Bayesian network structure, which contains five nodes.
The states of the nodes and the probabilities that are
associated with this structure are not shown.

The causal Bayesian network structure in Figure 1 indicates, for example, that a Viral infection in early
pregnancy can causally influence whether Congenital
heart disease is present in the newborn, which in turn
can causally influence Infant mortality and presence of
a Heart murmur.
2.2

d-separation and d-connectivity (Pearl,
1991)

d-separation is a graphical condition. Assume that A
and B are vertices in a DAG G and C is a set of vertices
in G such that A 6∈ C and B 6∈ C. The d-separation
theorem states that if a distribution P satisfies the
Markov condition (each vertex is independent of its
non-descendants conditional on its parents) for a DAG
G, and A is d-separated from B conditional on C in
G, then A is independent of B conditional on C in G.
Consider the DAG G in Figure 1. A and B are said
to be d-separated given C iff the following property
2
If there is an arc from node A to node B in a CBN, A
is said to be the parent of B, and B, the child of A.

holds: there exists no undirected path3 U between X
and Y s.t.

Bayesian network:
In a causal DAG for a causally sufficient set of
variables, each variable is independent of its
non-descendants (i.e., non-effects) given just
its parents (i.e., its direct causes).

1. every collider4 on U is in C or has a descendant
in C.
2. no other vertex on U is in C.
Likewise, if A and B are not in C, then A and B are
d-connected given C iff they are not d-separated given
C.
In Figure 1 the nodes X1 and X5 are d-separated by
X3 . The nodes X2 and X5 are d-connected given {}.
Two disjoint sets of variables A and B are d-separated
conditional on C if and only if every vertex in A is dseparated from every vertex in B conditional on C;
otherwise they are d-connected. See (Pearl, 1991) for
more details on d-separation and d-connectivity.
2.3

Independence equivalence

Two Bayesian network structures S and S∗ over a set
of observed variables V are independence equivalent
(Heckerman, 1995) iff S and S∗ have the same set of
d-separation and d-connectivity relationships between
A and B conditional on C where A ∈ V, B ∈ V,
and C ⊂ V and A 6∈ C and B 6∈ C. Independence
equivalence is also referred to as Markov equivalence.
For Gaussian or discrete distributions, it is also the
case that two DAGs are independence equivalent if and
only if the set of distributions that satisfy the Markov
condition for one equals the set of distributions that
satisfy the Markov condition for the other (i.e. they
represent the same set of distributions).
2.4

The causal sufficiency assumption

The CMC represents the “locality” of causality. This
implies that indirect (distant) causes become irrelevant
when the direct (near) causes are known. The CMC is
the fundamental principle relating causal relations to
probability distributions, and is explicitly or implicitly
assumed by all causal graph search algorithms.
2.6

The causal Faithfulness condition

While the causal Markov condition specifies independence relationships among variables, the causal
Faithfulness condition (CFC) specifies dependence
relationships:
In a causal DAG, two disjoint sets of variables
A and B are dependent conditional on a third
disjoint set of variables C unless the Causal
Markov Condition entails that A and B are
independent conditional on C.
The CFC is related to the notion that causal events are
typically correlated in observational data. The CFC
relates causal structure to probabilistic dependence.
The CFC can fail for certain parameter values, but for
linear or discrete parameters, the Lebesgue measure
of the set of parameters for which it fails is 0. It is at
least implicitly assumed by both constraint based and
score based causal DAG discovery algorithms.

A set of variables S is causally sufficient if no variable
that is a direct cause5 of two variables in S is not in
S. In Figure 1, S = {X2 , X3 } is not causally sufficient
because X1 is a direct cause of X2 and X3 , but is not
in S. However, note that for the causal discovery approach based on Y structures introduced in this paper,
we do not assume causal sufficiency.

Based on the causal Markov condition each vertex of
a CBN is independent of its non-descendants given its
parents. The independence map or I-map of a CBN
is the set of all independencies that follow from the
causal Markov condition. The dependence map or Dmap of a CBN is the set of all dependencies that follow
from the causal Faithfulness condition.

The I-map and D-map of the causal network
W1 → X ← W2 is as follows:

The causal Markov condition

The causal Markov condition (CMC) gives the independence relationships that are specified by a causal

An undirected path between two vertices A and B in
a graph G is a sequence of vertices starting with A and
ending with B and for every pair of vertices X and Y in
the sequence that are adjacent there is an edge between
them (X → Y or X ← Y ) (Spirtes et al., 2000, page 8)

2.7

Markov Blanket

The Markov blanket (MB) of a node X in a causal
Bayesian network G is the union of the set of parents
of X, the children of X, and the parents of the children

of X (Pearl, 1991). Note that the MB is the minimal
set of nodes when conditioned on (instantiated) that
makes a node X independent of all the other nodes in
the CBN.

V and Y structures

In this section we first define the V and Y structures
and discuss their potential role in causal discovery.

V structure

A “V” structure over variables W1 , W2 and X is shown
in DAG M1 in Figure 2. There is a directed edge from
W1 to X and another directed edge from W2 to X.
There is no edge between W1 and W2 . A “V” structure contains a “collider” and the node X is a collider
in Figure 2, M1 . Since there is no arc between W1 and
W2 , X is also termed as an unshielded collider. Figure 2, M2 is a model in which there is an arc between
W1 and W2 , and thus X is a shielded collider in this
example.

Figure 3: A model that has the same dependence/independence relationships over W1 , W2 and X
as Figure 2, M1 ; H denotes a hidden variable.
The V structure is not sufficient for discovering that
some variable W1 or W2 causes X if we do not make
the assumption that M1 is causally sufficient. On the
other hand, even allowing for confounders (hidden and
measured), we can conclude that X does not cause
W1 or W2 (Spirtes et al., 2000). Figure 3 shows a
confounder for the pair (W1 , X) and the pair (W2 , X).
In other words we can make an acausal discovery but
not a causal one using the V structure.

Figure 4: Several CBN models that contain four nodes.
G1 is a Y structure.
We now introduce the concept of a Y structure. Let
W1 → X ← W2 be a V structure. Note that X is an
unshielded collider in this V structure since there is no
arc between W1 and W2 . If there is a node Z such that
there is an arc from X to Z, and there are no arcs from
W1 to Z and W2 to Z, then the nodes W1 , W2 , X and
Z form a Y structure. A Y structure has interesting
dependence and independence properties.
If W1 , W2 , X, Z form a Y structure over a set of four
variables V and the Y structure is represented by G1
(see Figure 4), there is no DAG that contains a superset of the variables in V, entails the same conditional
independence relations over V, and in which there is a
(measured or unmeasured) confounder of X and Z, or
in which X is not an ancestor of Z (Robins et al., 2003;
Spirtes et al., 2000, page 187) that is in the same independence equivalence class as G1 . In other words, if a
Y structure is learned from data, the arc from X to Z
represents an unconfounded causal relationship. Since
G1 also has the same set of independence/dependence
relationships over the observed variables W1 , W2 , and
X as Figure 3), the arcs W1 → X and W2 → X cannot
be interpreted as causal relationships.

Y structure theorems

Definition 1 (Complete-table Bayesian network). A complete-table Bayesian network is one that
contains all discrete variables and for which the probabilities that define the Bayesian network are described
by contingency tables with no missing values.
Definition 2 (Perfect map). A Bayesian network
structure S is a perfect map of a distribution θ if A
and B are independent conditional on C in θ iff A and
B are d-separated conditional on C in S.
Suppose Bayesian network B defines a joint distribution θ over all the variables in B. Let S be the structure

of B. If the Markov and Faithfulness conditions hold
for B, then S is a perfect map of θ.
In the results of this section, we will only be considering complete-table Bayesian networks that satisfy the
Markov and Faithfulness conditions.
Definition 3 (Y structure Bayesian network). A
Y structure Bayesian network is a Bayesian network
containing four variables that has the structure shown
in Figure 5, where the node labels are arbitrary.

Figure 5: A Y structure.

We will use the following notation in regard to an
arbitrary complete-table Bayesian network that satisfies the Markov and Faithfulness conditions and has
a Y structure: By denotes the network, Sy denotes its
structure, Vy denotes the four variables in the structure, Qy denotes its complete table parameters, and θy
denotes the correspondingly defined joint distribution
over the four variables.
Lemma 1. There is no other Bayesian network structure on the variables in Vy that is independence equivalent to Sy .
Proof. The proof of Lemma 1 follows from Theorem 1
given below.
Theorem 1. Two network structures Bs1 and Bs2 are
independence equivalent iff they satisfy the following
conditions (Verma & Pearl, 1991):
1. Bs1 and Bs2 have the same set of vertices.
2. Bs1 and Bs2 have the same set of adjacencies.
3. If there is a configuration such as A → C ← B
where A and B are not adjacent (“V” structure)
in Bs1 , the same pattern is present in Bs2 , and
vice-versa.

Lemma 2. Let B be a Bayesian network that contains
the fewest number of parameters that can represent the
population distribution. Let B∗ be a Bayesian network
that either cannot represent the population distribution, or can but does not contain the fewest number of
parameters. Let S and S∗ be the network structures of

B and B∗ , respectively. Let m denote the number of iid
cases in D that have been sampled from the population
distribution defined by B.
P (S∗ , D)
< 1.
m→∞ P (S, D)

Then lim

(1)

Proof. The proof of Lemma 2 follows from the results
in (Chickering, 2002), which in turn uses results in
(Haughton, 1988).
Theorem 2. Let B = (S,Q) be a complete-table
Bayesian network that contains n measured variables,
where S and Q are the structure and parameters of B,
respectively. Suppose that B defines a distribution θ on
the n variables, such that S is a perfect map of θ. Let
D be a database containing m complete cases on the
n variables in B, for which the cases are iid samples
from distribution θ. Let B∗ be a Bayesian network over
the same n variables with structure S∗ that is not independence equivalent to B. Suppose that P (S, D) and
P (S∗ , D) are computed using the BDe score with nonzero parameter and structure priors. (The BDe score
assigns the same score to members of the same Markov
equivalent class when equal structural priors are assigned; see (Heckerman et al., 1995).)
P (S∗ , D)
< 1.
m→∞ P (S, D)

Then lim

(2)

Proof. If B∗ cannot represent the generative distribution θ then according to Lemma 2 the current theorem
holds. Suppose B∗ can represent the generative distribution. Since by assumption B∗ is not independence
equivalent to B, B∗ must contain all the dependence relationships in B, plus additional dependence relationships. Therefore B∗ contains more parameters than
B (Chickering, 2002, Proposition 8). Thus it follows
from Lemma 2 that the theorem holds.
Theorem 3. Assume the notation and conditions in
Theorem 2 and suppose the number of variables is four
(n = 4). If S is the data generating structure on the
four variables and S is a Y structure, then in the large
sample limit P (S, D) > P (S∗ , D) for all S∗ 6= S (where
S∗ contains just the same 4 variables). Conversely, if
S is the data generating structure and S is not equal
to some Y structure, S∗ , then in the large sample limit
P (S, D) > P (S∗ , D).
Proof. The proof follows from Theorem 2 and
Lemma 1.
Theorem 3 shows (under the conditions assumed) that
in the large sample limit a Y structure will have the
highest BDe score if and only if it is the structure
of the data generating Bayesian network. Note that

Theorem 3 assumes that some DAG over the measured
variables is a perfect map of the observed conditional
independence and dependence relations; this is not in
general true if there are unmeasured common causes.
Lemma 2 can be strengthened using results in (Nishii,
1988, Theorem 4) to show that in the large sample limit, with probability 1 the ratio approaches 0,
rather than merely approaching some positive number less than 1.6 Correspondingly, Theorem 3 can be
strengthened to state that the data generating structure has posterior probability 1 and all other structures
have probability 0 in the large sample limit7 . This
strengthened version of Theorem 3 implies that in the
large sample limit, model averaging using Equation 3
in the appendix will derive an arc X → Z as causal
and unconfounded with probability 1, if and only if
it (X → Z) is a causal and unconfounded arc within
a Y structure of the data generating causal Bayesian
network.
The proof of sufficiency of the Y structure for ascertaining causality in the possible presence of hidden
confounders requires an understanding of the common
properties of DAGs in the same Markov equivalence
class in the possible presence of such hidden variables.
A class of structures that can represent the common
properties of DAGs in the same Markov equivalence
class are called partial ancestral graphs (PAGs). We
next describe the theorems that make use of PAGs.
A PAG has a richer representation compared to a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and makes use of the following types of edges: →, ↔, ◦→, ◦—◦.
Partial ancestral graphs
A Markov equivalence class of DAGs over a set of observed variables O is the set of all DAGs that contain
at least the variables in O and that have the same
set of d-separation relations among the variables in
O (i.e., G1 and G2 are in the same Markov equivalence class over O if for all disjoint X, Y, Z ⊆ O, X
is d-separated from Y conditional on Z in G1 iff X is
d-separated from Y conditional on Z in G2 ). A PAG
P over O is a graphical object with vertices O that
represents the Markov equivalence class of DAGs M
over O in two distinct ways:
1. A PAG represents the d-separation relations over
O in M.
6

The results in (Nishii, 1988) are based on “almost
surely” convergent proofs, which guarantee that in the
large sample limit the data will with probability 1 support
the stated convergence.
7
If there are several Bayesian networks that contain the
fewest number of parameters that can represent the data
generating distribution, then the result states that the sum
of their posterior probabilities is equal to 1.

2. A PAG represents the ancestor and non-ancestor
relations among variables in O common to every
DAG in M.
More specifically, it is possible to extend the concept of
d-separation in a natural way to PAGs so that if PAG
P represents the Markov equivalence class M over O,
then for all disjoint X, Y, Z ⊆ O, X is d-separated
from Y conditional on Z in P iff X is d-separated
from Y conditional on Z in every DAG in M. A PAG
is formally defined as stated below.
Definition 4 (PAG). The PAG P that represents a
Markov equivalence class M over O can be formed in
the following way:
1. A and B are adjacent in P iff A and B
are d-connected conditional on every subset of
O\{A, B}.
2. If A and B are adjacent in P, there is an “−”
(arrowtail) at the A end of the edge iff A is an
ancestor of B in every member of M.
3. If A and B are adjacent in P, there is an “>”
(arrowhead) at the B end of the edge iff B is not
an ancestor of A in every member of M.
4. If A and B are adjacent in P, an “o” at the A
end of the edge entails that in some DAG in M,
A is an ancestor of B and in some other DAG in
M, A is not an ancestor of B. (In (Richardson &
Spirtes, 2002), this is called a maximally oriented
PAG.)

For example, suppose M is the Markov equivalence
class of the Y structure. It can be shown that the PAG
that represents a Y structure is in Figure 6, indicating
that for every DAG in M, the following conditions
hold:
• X is not an ancestor of W1 or W2 .
• Z is not an ancestor of X.
• X is an ancestor of Z.
• W1 and W2 are ancestors of X in some members
of M, and not ancestors of X in other members
of M.

Definition 5 (DAG PAG). For a PAG P, if there
is an assignment of arrowheads and arrowtails to the
“o” endpoints in P such that the resulting graph is a
DAG that has the same d-separation relations as P,
then P is a DAG PAG.
For example, a Y PAG is a DAG PAG because the
DAG in Figure 5 (which we will call the Y DAG) has
the same d-separation relations as the PAG in Figure 6. A DAG PAG can be parameterized in the same
way as a corresponding DAG. Every DAG PAG has
the same d-separations over the measured variables as
the DAGs that it represents. Every DAG PAG can be
assigned a score equal to the score of any of the DAGs
that it represents. The reader is referred to (Spirtes
et al., 1999) and (Spirtes et al., 2000, pages 299–301)
for additional details about PAGs. The FCI algorithm
is a constraint-based algorithm that generates a PAG
from data faithful to a DAG represented by the PAG.
A listing of the PAGs over four variables that includes
the Y PAG with a discussion of their causal implications is presented in (Richardson & Spirtes, 2003).
Definition 6 (Embedded pure Y structure). Let
B be a causal Bayesian network with structure S.
We say that B contains an embedded pure Y structure (EPYS) involving the variables W1 , W2 , X and Z,
iff all and only the following d-separation conditions
hold among the variables W1 , W2 , X and Z (A><B|C
means that A and B are d-separated conditioned on
C):
• W1 ><W2 |{}; W1 ><Z|{X}
• W1 ><Z|{X, W2 }; W2 ><Z|{X}
• W2 ><Z|{X, W1 }
Context 1. Let B be a complete-table Bayesian network involving the variables W1 , W2 , X and Z. Furthermore, let B be the data generating model for data
on just W1 , W2 , X and Z. In general, B may contain other variables, which we consider as hidden with
regard to the data being measured on these four variables.
Let θw1w2xz be the data generating distribution on the
variables W1 , W2 , X and Z that is given by a marginal
distribution of B. Suppose that every d-separation condition among W1 , W2 , X and Z in B implies a corresponding independence according to θw1w2xz (call
this the marginal Markov condition)8 . Suppose also
that every d-connection condition among W1 , W2 , X
and Z implies a corresponding dependence according

The marginal Markov condition is entailed by the
Markov condition, and is strictly weaker than the Markov
condition.

to θw1w2xz (call this the marginal Faithfulness condition)9 .
To summarize:
1. Let Sy denote the Y structure in Figure 5.
2. Let VSy denote the variables in Sy .
3. Let B be the Bayesian network generating the
data.
4. Let VB denote the variables in B.
5. In general VSy ⊆ VB .
6. Assume the marginal Markov and Faithfulness
conditions hold for B with respect to θw1w2xz .

Definition 7 (Non-collider). A variable X is said
to be a non-collider on a path if it does not have two
incoming arcs (arrowheads). See Figure 7 for examples.
Lemma 3. If B contains an EPYS, then in the large
sample limit, the Y PAG receives a higher score than
any other DAG PAG over the same variables, with
probability 1.
Proof. If B contains an EPYS, then by the Marginal
Faithfulness condition, the marginal population distribution is faithful to the Y PAG, and hence to the Y
DAG. By Theorem 3, the Y PAG receives a higher
score than any other DAG over the same variables,
and hence any other DAG PAG.
Let PAG(B) be the PAG for Bayesian network(B) over
the set of measured variables O.
Lemma 4. If B does not contain an EPYS, and the
population distribution is faithful to PAG(B), then in
the large sample limit, with probability 1 there is a
DAG PAG P over O that receives a higher score than
the Y PAG.
Proof. Suppose that B does not contain an EPYS.
There are three cases.
Suppose first that PAG(B) contains any adjacency between some pair of observed vertices A and C that
are not adjacent in the Y PAG. It follows that A

and C are d-separated conditional on some subset of
O in the Y PAG but not in PAG(B). Hence, by the
Marginal Faithfulness condition, in the population distribution A and C are dependent conditional on every
subset of O. Hence the Y PAG cannot represent the
marginal population distribution. Some DAG can represent the marginal population distribution, since a
DAG in which every pair of vertices are adjacent can
represent any distribution. Hence there is a DAG G
with the fewest number of parameters that can represent the marginal population distribution. By Lemma
2, in the large sample limit with probability 1, the Y
PAG receives a lower score than G.
Suppose next that PAG(B) contains the same adjacencies as the Y PAG, but different orientations. It is
easy to see by exhaustively considering all of the possible PAGs with the same adjacencies as the Y PAG
that each of them is a DAG PAG. Since the two different PAGs have the same d-separation relations as
some pair of different DAGs over O, we can reason
about their d-separation relations using two DAGs.
Given that they have the same adjacencies, the Y DAG
and the DAG G with the same d-separation relations
as PAG(B) are not equivalent iff they have different
unshielded colliders. Suppose that there is some unshielded collider A → D ← C in the Y DAG, but not in
G. It follows that A and C are d-separated conditional
on some subset of variables in the Y DAG, and that
every set that d-separates A and C in the Y DAG does
not contain D. In G, A and C are d-separated conditional only on subsets of variables that do contain D.
Hence there is a d-separation relation in the Y PAG
that is not in G. The case where A → D ← C is an unshielded collider in G, but not in the Y DAG, is analogous. Hence, by the marginal Faithfulness assumption
the Y PAG cannot represent the marginal population
distribution. By Lemma 2, in the large sample limit
with probability 1, the Y PAG receives a lower score
than some other DAG with the fewest parameters that
does represent the population distribution.
Finally, suppose that PAG(B) contains a proper subset of the adjacencies in the Y PAG. Inspection shows
that all of the PAGs with subsets of adjacencies of
the Y PAG are DAG PAGs. Hence, by the Marginal
Faithfulness condition, the population distribution is
faithful to some such PAG, and hence faithful to a
corresponding DAG. By Theorem 3 the DAG that the
population distribution is faithful to receives a higher
score than the Y PAG with probability 1 in the large
sample limit.

Let us consider the following example. Assume that
B contains the substructure shown in Figure 8. We
refer to this structure as Near-Y DAG or N-Y DAG

for short. The N-Y DAG has an additional arc from
W1 to Z when compared to the Y DAG shown in Figure 5.10 Note that for the N-Y DAG the d-separation
W1 ><Z|{X} does not hold and hence if B contains an
N-Y DAG, it will not be an embedded pure Y structure. According to Lemma 4 then with probability 1
there is a DAG PAG P over O that receives a higher
score than the Y PAG. Such a DAG PAG P is shown
in Figure 9.
The N-Y DAG also has interesting independence/dependence properties. It is the only member
of its independence class over the observed variables
W1 , W2 , X, and Z. A causal claim can be made for
the arc from X to Z in the N-Y DAG and it can be
estimated from P(x | z, w). We plan to generate a formal proof of causality for the N-Y DAG as part of our
future work.
Theorem 4. Assume that Context 1 holds. In the
large sample limit, in scoring DAGs on VSy , Sy is assigned the highest score, iff B contains a corresponding
EPYS, and if B contains such an EPYS, then X is an
ancestor of Z in B, and there is no unmeasured common cause of X and Z.
Proof. By Lemmas 3 and 4, Sy is assigned the highest
score, iff B contains a corresponding EPYS. In (Spirtes
et al., 2000) it is shown that if there is a directed edge
from X to Z in a PAG (as in the Y PAG), then X
is an ancestor of Z in every DAG represented by the

PAG, and there is no hidden common cause of X and
Z in any such DAG.
Theorem 4 indicates that local Bayesian causal discovery using Y structures is possible (under assumptions),
even when the data generating process is assumed to
be a causal Bayesian network with hidden variables.

Discussion

The local Bayesian causal discovery based on Y structures may have practical applications on large data
sets such as gene expression data sets with thousands
of variables or large population-based data sets with
hundreds of thousands of records. As the Y structure
represents an unconfounded causal influence of a variable X on variable Z, it can be used for performing
planned interventions leading to desirable outcomes.
When experimental studies are contra-indicated, due
to ethical, logistical, or cost considerations, causal discovery from observational data remains the only feasible approach. Moreover, in resource limited settings
such methods can be initially used to generate plausible causal hypothesis that can then be tested using
experimental methods resulting in better utilization
of available resources. As part of our future work, we
plan to relax some of our causal discovery assumptions
(for example, the acyclicity assumption) and extend
the proofs to more complex Y structures such as those
with measured confounders.

Appendix: Search

The proofs presented in this paper for the EPYS do not
depend on a particular search heuristic for the identification of tetrasets (sets of four variables) for Y structure scoring. An obvious search method is to search
for EPYS in all possible tetrasets of a domain. For different finite sample sizes the BLCD search method has
been shown to be effective in simulation studies. The
BLCD search first estimates the Markov blanket of a
node X, and creates sets of four variables by choosing three nodes from the MB of X in addition to X.
The tetrasets are scored using the Score function described in Appendix B. A preliminary version of the
BLCD algorithm was published in (Mani & Cooper,
2004). The reader is referred to (Mani, 2005) for additional details, including results of an extensive set of
simulation experiments.

Appendix: Scoring measure

The Score function assigns a score to a model that
represents the probability of the model given data

and prior knowledge. For scoring the DAGs, we use
the Bayesian likelihood equivalent (BDe) scoring measure (Heckerman et al., 1995). We use uniform, noninformative priors in order to test the ability of the
algorithm to discover causal relationships from data,
rather than from a combination of data and prior
knowledge. The latter introduces two sources of experimental variation. Note that for a Y structure,
the causal claim is valid for only the arc from X to
Z. We represent the Y structure using the notation
X ⇒ Z. In the large sample limit under the causal
Markov and causal Faithfulness assumptions (see Section 2), P(X ⇒ Z|D) (D denotes the dataset) can be
estimated using Equation 3:
Score(G1 |D)
P543
i=1 Score(Gi |D)

(3)

where Gi represents one of the 543 CBNs over V =
{W1 , W2 , X, Z}.
Note that P(X ⇒ Z|D) is a heuristic approximation
to what would be obtained if we were to explicitly
perform a full Bayesian scoring that includes hidden
variables. The score for each of the 543 measured
structures represents a score for both the measured
structure itself, as well as the score for an infinite number of structures with hidden variables. Interpreting
the score as a probability is a heuristic approximation
borne out by simulation studies (Mani, 2005), but the
theorems in the paper do not depend upon that approximation. The only probabilities being considered
are the probability of being a Y structure and the probability of not being a Y structure. The theorems in the
paper show the conditions under which P(X ⇒ Z|D)
converges to the correct value in the large sample limit.
In the large sample limit the posterior probability of
G1 will be greater relative to the other 542 models if
indeed (1) X causally influences Z in an unconfounded
manner, (2) X is an unshielded collider of W1 and W2
in the distribution of the causal process generating the
data, and (3) the Markov and Faithfulness conditions
hold.
