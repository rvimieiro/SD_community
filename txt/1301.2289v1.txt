Introduction

Bayesian Networks (BNs) provide a compact and natural
representation for multivariate probability distributions in a
wide variety of domains. Recently, there has been a grow­
ing interest in domains which contain both discrete and
continuous variables, called

hybrid

domains. Examples of

such domains include target tracking

[1],

where the con­

tinuous variables represent the state of one or more targets
and the discrete variables might model the maneuver type;
visual tracking (e.g.,

[13]),

where the continuous variables

represent the positions of various body parts of a person and
the discrete variables the type of movement; and fault di­
agnosis

[4].

The conditional probability distributions

(CPDs) of these nodes are often modeled as

[I 0], where a physical system contains continuous

variables such as flows and pressures and discrete variables
such as failure events.

softmax func­

tions, which include as a special case a "soft" threshold
function for a continuous parent (i.e., a noisy indicator
whether the value of the continuous parent is greater than
some constant). There are many domains that can be mod­
eled very naturally using augmented CLG networks, in­
cluding our thermostat example above.
Unfortunately, there is no exact inference algorithm
known for augmented CLG networks. One can always re­
sort to the use of approximate inference, such as discretiza­
tion (e.g.,

or

[5]) or sampling (either Likelihood Weight­
Gibbs Sampling [12]), but these approaches

have some serious limitations.

It is often hard to find a

good discretization: Sometimes any reasonable discretiza­

Inference in CLGs

We present a brief review of Lauritzen's algorithm for in·
ference in CLG networks, on which our algorithm is based.
The algorithm has two versions: the original one [6] and
an improvement to it [7]. Both versions are based on the
clique tree algorithm [8]. The clique tree algorithm begins
by transforming the BN into a clique tree. The first step is
to generate the moralized graph, where the parents of each
node are connected directly, and all edges are undirected.
The moralized graph is then transformed into a clique tree
using a process called triangulation (see [8] for details). In
the clique tree, each node (also called a clique) is associated
with a data structure, called a potential, that can represent
a function over the possible values of the variables in the
clique (in general, these data structures are called factors).
In a purely discrete BN, the factor is typically a table with
one entry (a number) for each assignment to the variables
in the clique. In the message passing phase of the algo·
rithm, factors are passed between neighboring cliques. At
the end of this phase, every clique potential contains the
correct marginal distribution over the clique variables.
Several issues arise when extending the clique tree al­
gorithm to CLG networks. Most obviously, the factors
in the cliques and the messages are functions over both
discrete and continuous variables and cannot be repre­
sented by tables as in the discrete case. Lauritzen's al­
gorithm deals with this issue by defining a factor as a
table which specifies a continuous function for every in­
stantiation of the discrete variables. The two versions of
the algorithm use these continuous functions in different
ways. In the original version, the functions are treated as
canonical forms, which can represent any function of the
form
g, h, K) = exp [g + x' h + x' J{ x], where g is
a constant, h is a vector and K is a full-rank square rna·
trix. Note that a multivariate Gaussian, whose density is
exp
is a special case

P(x;

�

(-(x- J.t)t�-1(x- �t)/2),

of this form (see [6] for formulae to convert from a mul·
tivariate Gaussian to canonical form). However, not ev­
ery function representable in canonical form is a multivari­
ate Gaussian (e.g., exp(x2)). In fact, canonical forms can
represent functions which are not probability distributions:
They do not necessarily have a finite integral and their mo­
ments may not be defined. In particular, CLG CPDs, which
represent a conditional rather than a joint distribution, are
representable in canonical form but not as a Gaussian. In
the new version of the algorithm, the factors represent con­
ditional Gaussians, i.e., they represent a conditional distri­
bution of a subset of the variables given the rest.

321

The clique tree algorithm manipulates factors in vari­
ous ways, such as multiplying, dividing and marginalizing.
Lauritzen shows how all these operations can be carried out
exactly in both versions of the algorithm, with the notable
exception of summing out a discrete variable. For example,
consider a factor over the variables A and X (where A is
discrete and X is continuous) and assume we need to com·
pute its marginal over X in order to send a message to a
neighboring clique (i.e., sum out the variable A). Since the
message contains only one Gaussian, we need to collapse
the two Gaussian components in the original mixture, while
maintaining the correct first and second moments. W hile
we can collapse Gaussians using their moments, the op­
eration is not defined for a general canonical form or for
a conditional Gaussian in which the moments may not be
well defined. Thus, we must ensure that when the message
passing algorithm calls for collapsing, our factors will rep­
resent Gaussians.
To ensure this property, Lauritzen's algorithm imposes
certain constraints on the form of the clique tree. These
lead to the notion of strong triangulation. While the ex­
act details are not important for the purposes of this paper
(see [6, 7]), one of the implications of strong triangulation
is important for our analysis. Define a continuous con·
nected component as a set of continuous variables X such
that every two variables X1 X2 E X are connected in the
moralized graph via a chain consisting only of continuous
variables. We define DN(X), the discrete neighbors of X,
as the set of discrete variables that are adjacent to some
variable in X in the moralized graph. Strong triangulation
implies that all the variables in DN( X) necessarily appear
together in some clique in the tree. The intuition for this
requirement is that the distribution over X is a mixture of
Gaussians with one mixture component for every assign­
ment to DN(X); hence, we must consider all the combina­
tions of the discrete neighbors together.

,

The cost of Lauritzen's algorithm is polynomial in the
size of the factors in the cliques. This size grows exponen­
tially with the number of discrete variables in the clique,
and quadratically with the number of continuous variables
in the clique. Thus, the strong triangulation property, al­
though unavoidable, is a major computational limitation of
Lauritzen s algorithm. (See [9] for further discussion.)

Inference in Augmented CLGs

We now extend Lauritzen's algorithm to the class of aug­
mented CLG networks defined in Section 2. We present
our algorithm in the context of the original version of
Lauritzen's algorithm and later show how it can be easily
adapted for the modified version.
We first motivate our algorithm with a simple example.
Consider the network X -+ A, where X has a Gaussian
distribution given by P(X) = N(J.t, <7) and the CPD of A
is a softmax given byP(A= liX=x)= 1/(l+ea"'+b).

This basic idea leads us to the following outline for an
verging only in cases where a clique contains CD CPDs; in
this case, we approximate its factor as a mixture of Gaus­
sians, where the mixture has one Gaussian -with the cor­
rect first and second moments - for each instantiation of
the discrete variables (no matter their configuration). In the
remainder of this section, we "fill in" the details of this al­
gorithm, addressing the subtleties that arise.

(1) compute expectations relative to P(x ) : To

evaluate these expressions at a clique, we must have a prob­

ability distribution over X at that clique. Unfortunately, the
message passing algorithm does not guarantee that these

distributions are available initially. Consider the network

two cliques: (X , Y) and (Y, A). In Lauritzen's algorithm,

the clique tree is initialized by incorporating all CPDs into

the message passing has not yet been performed. As such,
Y is given in canonical form and does not yet represent a

integration; thus, we cannot multiply the CPD

rather than the true one, potentially leading to sub-optimal
approximations. Fig. 2(a) shows an example of this phe­
nomenon, where the approximation obtained by first inte­

is a sub-optimal approximation. T he optimal approxima­
tion uses the posterior over Y directly as our integration
distribution.

The first difficulty is that our prior distribution is com­

Gaussian distribution relative

to which we can compute the relevant expectations, rather
than a non-Gaussian canonical form. To do so, we build
the standard clique tree for our BN, but do not initialize
the clique potentials. We then insert all the CPDs except
for the CD CPDs. The resulting network is equivalent to a
CLG network, so we can calibrate it using Lauritzen's algo­
rithm, resulting in probability distributions in each clique.
Finally, we insert the remaining CD CPDs and re-calibrate
the tree. Note that the cliques in our tree were designed

before entering the softmax CPDs.
A more subtle problem with our choice of integration dis­
tribution relates to the use of collapsing within Lauritzen's
algorithm. Consider a network

(X , Y, B) and
(A, X , B) (note that the tree (A, X ), (X, Y), (Y, B) is in­

consistent with strong triangulation). According to our cur­
rent algorithm, we calibrate the clique tree with the CPDs
for A,

X , and Y , and then insert the CPD P( B

I Y) into the

clique (X , Y, B). However, the distribution in this clique is

not the correct prior distribution over Y. The correct prior
distribution of Y has two modes (one for every value of
A); but, as A does not appear in the clique, Lauritzen's al­
gorithm collapses the two modes into a single Gaussian,
losing its bimodal nature. Although Lauritzen shows that
this approximation can be used without introducing new
errors if the functions are linear, the CPD

linear, and we may not get the best approximation

for the

first two moments. Fig. 2(b) shows an example, where our
approximation is worse when we use the collapsed distri­
bution for Y as the integration distribution.
Once again, the solution is to enter the CD CPD into a
clique where the integration distribution over the continu­
ous parents is correct. Let

and sufficient to have a clique containing the variabl es in
both X and A. Of course, this requirement could result
in a larger clique tree; however, the overhead is not large.
As we discussed earlier, A must be in some clique in the
optimal tree. Thus, at worst , we only add some continuous
variables to some of the cliques. Since the represntation of
canonical forms (and multivariate Gaussians) is quadratic
in the number of variables, the size of the tree can only
grow by a polynomial factor at worst.
Note that this modification to the clique tree is necessary
only if we want to guarantee the optimal approximation.
The algorithm remains coherent if we use an approximate
integration distribution, only the quality of our approxima­
tion can degrade. Therefore, we can use a clique tree where
the clique that contains X contains only some subset of the
variables in A.
The final problem arises when there is more than one CD
CPD. Most simply, we can insert each CD CPDs sequen­
tially. We insert each CD CPD, appro ximate the resulting
joint distribution as a mixture of Gaussians, and proceed
to use that mixture as t he basis for inserting the next one.
The obvious problem with this approach is that the inte­
gration distribution used for the CD CPDs inserted later is
only an approximation to the correct non-Gaussian distri­
bution resulting from the insertion of the earlier CD CPDs.
The solution to the problem is to integrate all the CD CPDs
in the same continuous connected component in one oper­
ation. In Fig. 2(c), we show the difference on the network
A - X -+ Y -+ B. We tried inserting both softmax
CPDs into the clique containing X and Y together, and
separately. We experimented both with step-like transitions
("sharp" sigmoids), and smoother transitions. The latter al­
lows for a better approximation as a Gaussian, and there­
fore less error by doing the approxi mation step by step.
This difference is clearly manifested in the figure.
While the idea of joint integration seems expensive, we
note that the relevant CPDs must already be in the same
clique (with their discrete neighbors), so we do not increase
the size of the tree. However, we do pay the price of com-

This scheme induces a spectrum of approximations, with
a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy: If doing the

a more efficient and less accurate integration method.

In-clique integration

Having defined the overall structure of the algorithm, it re­
mains only to discuss the integration process within each
clique. There is a wide range of numerical integration
methods t hat can be applied in our setting. We focus our at­

in the number of continuous variables in the worst case.

Analysis

We now show that our algorithm is "exact", up to errors
caused by numerical integration.

We use "exact" in the

same sense used in Lauritzen's algorithm: It computes the
correct distribution over the discrete nodes, and the correct
first and second moments for the continuous ones.

1 Let Q be a query such that Q s;:; C where C
is some clique in the tree and let e be some evidence. The
above algorithm computes a distribution P ( Q, e) which is
exact ior discrete variables in Q and has the correct first
two moments for continuous variables in Q, up to inaccu­
racies caused by numerical integration.
Theorem

Proof: We start by showing that the algorithm is exact
when the

moralized graph contains one continuous con­

nected component and the clique tree has just one node.
The algorithm has three steps, and we analyze the result of
applying each one of them. The first step involves insert­
ing discrete and CLG CPDs into the clique tree. Since

all

the variables are in one clique (hence there is no need for

does not introduce any inaccuracies. We now consider the
continuous evidence. Setting the evidence is equivalent to
setting the relevant values in every function of the product
of the tree and the CD CPDs. In the clique potential this
can be done using Lauritzen's standard algorithm. In the
CD CPDs we are guaranteed that any continuous evidence
variables that appear in the CPD must be parents; Thus, we
can simply set their value and get a new conditional dis­
tribution not involving them, which is either a CD CPD or
just a discrete factor.
The last step is the insertion of the CD CPDs into the
clique potential. Had we been able to represent the answer
exactly, then the clique potential would have been the exact
posterior distribution. However, we approximate each of
the continuous components in the potential as a Gaussian,
computed in a way that guarantees it has the correct first
two moments (up to numerical integration inaccuracies).
We now remove the various assumptions. The clique

where the CD CPDs are entered need not contain discrete
variables which are not discrete neighbors of the continu­
ous connected component, since it can represent the exact
distribution over the continuous variables without them. It
also need not contain continuous variables which are not
involved in any CD CPD. The key insight here is that after
incorporating all the non-linear functions into

Experimental Results

We tested various aspects of our algorithm and compared it
to other approaches. As we discussed, Gaussian quadrature
does not scale up well in high dimensions. To demonstrate
the effects of integrating in high dimensions we tested our
algorithm on networks where the continuous variables form

problems in different dimensions. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show
the result of performing the integration in one and eight di­
mensions using both Gaussian quadrature and Monte Carlo
integration. In one dimension, Gaussian quadrature is ex­
tremely efficient, achieving good accuracy with as few as 5
integration points. In eight dimensions, Gaussian quadra­
ture needs many more points to achieve a similar accuracy.
Note that we need at least two points in every dimension,
for a total of at least 256 points in 8 dimensions. As we dis­

cussed, it is possible to dramatically speed up the integra­
tion by taking advantage of the sigmoid function, represent­
ing the linear combinations of the eight parents as one vari­
able; indeed, we get a reduction of approximately three or­
ders of magnitudes in the number of points required. Note
that this case still converges more slowly than simple inte­
gration in one dimension. The reason is that the variance
of the dummy parent is larger than the variance we used in
one dimension (we further discuss this issue in Section

7).

Finally, we can see that although Monte Carlo integration
converges quite slowly, it is almost unaffected by the higher
dimension, and can be used in cases where we have no

works can be divided into three classes:

Discussion

In this paper, we presented the first exact inference algo­
rithm for augmented CLG networks. We use numerical in­
tegration to compute the first two moments of every mix­
ture component and thus approximate it as a multivariate
Gaussian. We show how this approach can be incorporated
into Lauritzen' s clique tree algorithm (both the original and
the modified version), which enables us to take advantage
of the properties of the network to speed up the computa­

tion. In particular, our algorithm exploi ts both the linearity

of the CLG part of the network, and the properties of the
softmax CPDs (when appl icable) , to reduce the dimension

of the integrati on . We proved that ou r algorithm p roduces
the correct distribution over the discrete variables, and the

correct first two moments of the continuous variables , up to

inaccurac ies resulting from numerical integration . Thus, it

gives the best approximati o n within our expressive power.

Our algorithm is not restricted to any special class of the
conditional distributions in the CD CPDs - we can always
compute the correct first two moments , resulting in a Gaus­
sian approximation . However, the quality of the Gaussian
approximation varies for different classes of conditional
distributions. In the common case of softmax CPDs, the
Gaussian approximation is often an excellent approxima­
tion to the true posterior distribution.

As our algorithm relies heavily on numerical integration,
its performance is directly related to the quality and effi­
ciency of the n umerical integrati on procedure. The Gaus­
sian quadrature method works particularly well in many
networks but ru ns into problems in high dimensions and
when the sigmoids are sharp relative to the variance of the

Gaussian (i .e. , they resemble a step function rather than
a smooth transition). The reason for this problem is that
Gaussian quadrature tries to find a set of points which op­

timizes the performance for fu nctions which are polynomi­

als. Since the smoother the function is, the better its ap­
proximation as a l ow degree polyn omial , Gaussian quadra­

ture is more accurate with smooth sigmoids. We point out
that, in the case of sharp sigmoids , a Gaussian approxima­
tion of the posterior can be quite bad and one may not want

to use it regardless of the numerical integration accuracy.

In any c ase, when Gaussian quadrature is not well suited

for the problem, we can use other integration methods such
as adaptive i ntegration and Monte Carlo methods.

Existi ng methods

for i nference in augmented CLG net­
discretization,

samp1ing methods and variational methods. Discretization
is conceptual ly simple: we discretize every variable and
then use standard discrete inference.

Unfortunately, dis­

cretization requires a fine resolution for an

adequate repre­

sentation even of simple distributions and the situation de­

grades exponentially with the number of dimensions, mak­
ing the approach intractable for large clique trees.

Sampling is a general method that can handle non ­
standard distributions such as CD CPDs; it has a low space

complexity, and is guaranteed to converge as the number of
s ampl es

N goes to infinity. There are two main classes of

sampling algorithms: those based on likelihood weighting

(LW) and those based on MCMC. The advantages of LW

are its generality and simplicity. However, it suffers from a
few problems.
der of

First , the convergence rate is slow ( on the or­

1/VN).

In contrast, our algorithm converges much

faster in c ases where the integration dimension is low. Both

LW and our algorithm have problems when dealing with
unlikely evidence, but the problems are much worse in LW.

Continuous evidence i s very problematic in LW, due to the
exponential decay of the Gaussian distribution. This type
of evidence has no impact on the accuracy of our algorithm.

While there is some i mpact in the case of unlikely discrete
evidence, it is much Jess si gnificant than in LW; as shown
in

Section 6, our algorithm achieves substantially higher

accuracies than LW in the same amount of running ti me.
On top of the slow convergence of

methods, MCMC methods converge very slowly when the
mixing rate of the Markov chain

is slow, which depends

i n unpredictable ways on the network parameters. In addi­

tion,

MCMC may run into problems in arbitrary complex

CD CPDs. To correctly sample a value for some variable,
one has to combine all the CPDs in which it is involved
into a samp ling distribution - if the CPDs are complex,

this task is not

trivial. It would have been very interest­

ing to compare the results of our algorithm to BUGS, but
problems in BUGS prevented us from doing so. However,
even o ur partial results imply that, at least in

the case of

the Emission network , BUGS requires many samples to
achieve convergence, while our algorithm produced instan­

taneous answers. We do not know whether the wrong con­
vergence is a simple implementation problem, or whether
it results from a more fundamental difficulty.

Our algorithm appears closer in spirit to the variational
approximation approach proposed in

[ 1 1 , 1 6] . However,

the variational approach is limited to binary softmax distri­
butions, while our algorithm is completely general. More
importantly, our algorithm is guaranteed to give the correct
answer (up to numerical integration errors), while the varia­
tional approach has no guarantees. It seems that variational
approximation would suffer from the same problems of un­
likely evidence as our approach. It is interesting to explore
whether the variational approximation is sensitive to issues
such as the slope of the sigmoids as is our algorithm. (I.e.,
is it more difficult to find a good setting for the variational
parameters when the sigmoids are sharp and as a result the
quality of the approximation degrades.)
The most significant limitation of our algorithm, shared
with the variational approach, results from its relationship
to Lauritzen's algorithm.

As shown in [9], even simple

CLG networks can lead to clique trees that are intractably
large. An important open problem is to devise approxima­
tion schemes that are suitable for hybrid networks where
Lauritzen's algorithm cannot be applied.
