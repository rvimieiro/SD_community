Abstract
We describe an expert system, Maies, under development for analysing forensic identification problems involving DNA mixture
traces using quantitative peak area information. Peak area information is represented by conditional Gaussian distributions,
and inference based on exact junction tree
propagation ascertains whether individuals,
whose profiles have been measured, have contributed to the mixture. The system can also
be used to predict DNA profiles of unknown
contributors by separating the mixture into
its individual components. The use of the
system is illustrated with an application to a
real world example. The system implements
a novel MAP (maximum a posteriori) search
algorithm that is briefly described.

Introduction

Probabilistic expert systems (PES) for evaluating
DNA evidence were introduced in [1]. This paper is
concerned with describing the current status of a computer software system called Maies (Mixture Analysis
in Expert Systems) that analyses mixed traces where
several individuals may have contributed to a DNA
sample left at a scene of crime. In [2] it was shown how
to construct a PES using information about which alleles were present in the mixture, and we refer to this
article for a general description of the problem and for
genetic background information. (A brief summary to
genetic terminology is given in Appendix A.)
The results of a DNA analysis are usually represented
as an electropherogram (EPG) measuring responses in
relative fluorescence units (RFU) and the alleles in the
mixture correspond to peaks with a given height and
area around each allele, see Figure 1. The band intensity around each allele in the relative fluorescence

units represented, for example, through their peak areas, contains important information about the composition of the mixture.

from a mixture. Peaks represent alleles at 15, 17 and
18 and the areas and height of the peaks express the
quantities of each. Since the peak around allelic position 17 is the highest this indicates that the 17 allele
is likely to be a homozygote or a shared allele between
two heterozygotes. This image is supplied courtesy of
LGC Limited, 2004.
The main focus of the present paper is to describe the
current status of a computer package called Maies,
which automatically builds Bayesian network models
for mixture traces based on conditional Gaussian distributions [3] for the peak areas, given the composition
of the true DNA mixtures. Currently the program only
considers a DNA mixture from exactly two contributors, which seems to be the most common scenario in
forensic casework [4], and the program ignores other
important complications such as stutter, dropout alleles, etc.

We distinguish two types of calculations that Maies
can perform. One type is evidential calculation, in
which a suspect with known genotype is held and we
want to determine the likelihood ratio for the hypothesis that the suspect has contributed to the mixture
vs. the hypothesis that the contributor is a randomly
chosen individual. We distinguish two cases: the other
contributor could be a victim with a known genotype
or a contaminator with an unknown genotype, possibly without a direct relation to the crime. This could
be a laboratory contamination or any other source
of contamination from an unknown contributor. The
other type calculation that Maies can perform is the
separation of profiles, i.e. identifying the genotype of
each of the possibly unknown contributors to the mixture, the evidential calculation playing a secondary
role. Both types of calculation are illustrated in § 5.

of DNA in a mixture sample. The model is idealized in
that it ignores complicating artefacts such as stutter,
drop-out alleles and so on, and assumes that the mixture is made up of DNA from two people, who we refer
to as p1 and p2. Typically, prior to amplification in a
laboratory, a DNA mixture sample will contain an unknown number of cells from p1 and a further unknown
number of cells from p2. Hence there is an unknown
common fraction, or proportion, across the markers
of the amount of DNA from p1, that we denote by
θ. In an ideal amplification apparatus, during each
amplification cycle the proportion of alleles of each allelic type would be preserved without error. We model
departures from this ideal as random variation using
the Gaussian distributions, and we introduce an additional variance term to represent other measurement
error, represented by ω 2 .

Previous related work includes that of [5] and [6] who
respectively developed numerical methods known as
Linear Mixture Analysis (LMA) and Least Square Deconvolution (LSD) for separating mixture profiles using peak area information. Both methods are based
on least squares heuristics that assume the mixture
proportion of the contributors’ DNA in the sample is
constant across markers. A computer program has
been written [7] for estimating the proportion of the
individual contributions in two-person mixtures and to
rank the genotype combinations based on minimizing
a residual sum of squares. More recently, [8] describes
PENDULUM, a computer package to automate guidelines in [9] and [7]. None of the methods described
above utilizing peak area information are probabilistic in nature, nor do they use information about allele
frequency. In contrast, the methodology proposed in
[10] combines a model using the gene frequencies with
a model describing variability in scaled peak areas to
calculate likelihood ratios and study their sensitivity
to assumptions about the mixture proportions.

The post-amplification proportions of alleles for each
marker are represented in the peak area information,
which we include in the analysis through the relative
peak weight. The (absolute) peak weight wa of an allele
with repeat number a is defined by scaling the peak
area with the repeat number as wa = aαa , where αa
is the peak area around allele a. Multiplying the area
with the repeat number is a crude way of correcting for
the fact that alleles with a high repeat number tend to
be less amplified than alleles with a low repeat number.
For issues concerning heterozygous imbalance see [11].

The plan of the rest of the paper is as follows. In
the following section we describe the mathematical
assumptions underlying the Bayesian networks that
Maies generates for analysing two-person DNA mixtures. We then describe the components that Maies
uses to build up the networks. This is followed by a
description of a simple MAP search algorithm, implemented in Maies for separation of profiles. We then
illustrate the use of Maies on a real life example, and
then summarize future work required to make Maies
into a tool for routine casework.

To avoid the arbitrariness in scaling used to measure
the areas, we consider the observed relative peak weight
ra , obtained by scaling with the total peak weight as
X
ra = wa /w+ , w+ =
wa ,

The mathematical model

Our PES is a probabilistic model for relating the preamplification and post-amplification relative amounts

We further assume that
• The peak weight for an allele is approximately
proportional to the amount of DNA of that allelic
type;
• The peak weight for an allele possessed by both
contributors is the sum of the corresponding
weights for the two contributors.

so that then

= 1.

For the relative peak weight, denoted by the random
variable Ra , we assume a Gaussian error distribution
Ra ∼ N (µa , τa2 ),

(2)
µa = {θn(1)
a + (1 − θ)na }/2, (1)

where θ is the proportion, or fraction, of DNA in the
(i)
mixture originating from the first contributor, na is
the number of alleles with repeat number a possessed
(i)
by person i. Note that na ∈ {0, 1, 2} and hence µa ∈
[0, 1].

We assume an error variance for τa2 of the form
τa2

= σ µa (1 − µa ) + ω

(2)

for U.S. Caucasians for the analysis in § 5 of data taken
from [9]2

where σ and ω are variance factors for the contributions to the variation from the amplification and measurement processes.1 Note that if µa = 0 then τa2 = ω 2
and Ra ∼ N (0, ω 2 ). The interpretation of this is that
if there are no alleles of type a in the mixture prior
to amplification, then any detected post-amplification
can be ascribed to measurement error. Similarly if
µa = 1 , which means that for the given marker all
alleles are of type a in the mixture before amplification, then Ra ∼ N (1, ω 2 ), that is post amplification
all alleles for the given marker are of type a, up to
measurement error.
However the Bayesian networks that Maies constructs
uses the variance structure
τa2 = σ 2 µa + ω 2 .

(3)

The reason is that we need to consider the correlation
between weights due to the fact that they must add
up to unity. It turns out, perhaps surprisingly, that
the
P likelihood obtained using (3) when conditioned on
a ra = 1 has precisely the form as would be obtained
using the likelihood based on (2) used in our model if
we ignore measurement error by setting ω 2 = 0, and
2
the likelihoods are
P very close numerically for small ω .
This constraint a ra = 1 is imposed when we enter
the complete set of observed peak weights as evidence
in our networks. The proof, too long for this paper,
may be found in [12].
In our example in § 5 we used σ 2 = 0.01 and ω 2 =
0.001, corresponding approximately to a standard
deviation
for the observed relative weight of about
p
0.01/4 + 0.001 = 0.06 for µa = 0.5 substituted into
(2). These parameter values imply that when amplifying DNA from one heterozygous individual (for which
µa = 0.5), an ra value at two standard deviations from
the mean would give a value of 0.38/0.62 = 0.61 for
the ratio of the minor to the major peak area; this is
about the limit of variability in peak imbalance that
has been reported in the literature [13], and suggests
that our chosen parameter values are perhaps conservative.
In general the variance factors may depend on the
marker and on the amount of DNA analysed, but for
simplicity we use the values above. (Our PES model is
robust to small changes in these parameter estimates.)
Finally, we assume known gene frequencies of single
STR alleles; in particular we use those reported in [14]

Maies

The basic form of our Bayesian network models is
fairly straightforward, but the networks can grow large
when modelling the ten or so markers typical in a
mixture problem. (In the example in § 5 the network
has 237 nodes.) One way to manage this complexity is to use object-oriented Bayesian network software, as we describe in detail in [12]. Here we describe Maies, a purpose built program that, after entering peak area information and available genetic information (if available) about the potential contributors, automatically constructs a single conditionalGaussian Bayesian network on which the probability
calculations are performed. Maies implements the local propagation scheme of [15]. Peak areas are automatically converted to normalized weights and entered
as evidence in the relevant nodes by the program.
An example of a network generated for a single marker
with two alleles observed in the mixture is shown in
Figure 2. The figure illustrates the repetitive modular
structure that makes it possible for Maies to create
the much larger Bayesian networks required to analyse
mixtures on several markers. We now describe these
various structures and how they interrelate, working
from top to bottom in Figure 2.

The first term in the variance structure in (2) can be
seen as a second order approximation to a more sophisticated model based on gamma distributions for the absolute
scaled peak weights to be discussed elsewhere.

This dataset has an observed allele 36 of the marker
D21. As none of the 302 subjects in [14] had this allele, we
chose to use 1/604=0.00166 as its frequency.

3.1

Top level people

Maies currently models mixtures only for DNA from
two individuals. Thus it sets up nodes for four individuals who are paired up, prefixed by s (for suspect),
v (for victim), and u1 and u2 representing two unspecified persons from the population. Corresponding
to each of these individuals is a triple of nodes representing their genotype (gt) on the marker, and the
individuals’ paternal (pg) and maternal (mg) genes.
The probability tables associated with the maternal
and paternal genes contain the allele frequencies of the
observed alleles, whilst the conditional probability table associated with the genotype node is the logical
combination of the maternal and paternal gene.
3.2

3.4

Repeat number nodes

On the level below the allele counting nodes are the repeat number nodes, labelled 8 inmix?, 9 inmix? and
x inmix?. These are (yes,no) binary valued nodes
representing whether or not the particular alleles are
present in the mixture: thus for example allele 8 is
present in the mixture if either of the allele counting nodes p1 8 or p2 8 takes a non-zero value. For
the node x inmix? the x refers to all of the alleles
in the marker that are not observed. When using repeat number information as evidence the repeat number nodes present in the mixture will be given the value
yes and x inmix? will be given the value no.

Actual contributors to the mixture

The genotypes on the marker of the two individuals
p1 and p2 whose DNA is in the mixture are the nodes
labelled p1gt and p2gt. Node p1gt has incoming arrows from nodes u1gt, sgt and a (yes,no) valued
binary node labelled p1 = s?. The function of this
latter node is to set the genotype of node p1gt to be
that of sgt if p1 = s? takes the value yes, otherwise
to set the genotype of node p1gt to be that of u1gt.
An equivalent relationship holds between the genotype
nodes p2gt, vgt, u2gt and p2 = v?. Uniform priors
are placed on the nodes p1 = s? and p2 = v?.
The node labelled target represents the four possible combinations of values of the two nodes p1 = s?
and p2 = v?, with a conditional probability table of
zeros and ones representing the logical identities. The
marginal posterior distribution of this node is used to
calculate likelihood ratios in evidential calculations.
The network also has a node representing the joint
genotypes of individuals p1 and p2, which is labelled
jointgt, with incoming arrows from p1gt and p2gt;
the (quite big) conditional probability table associated
with this node has entries that are either of zero or one.
The most likely configuration of the marginal distribution in all joint genotype nodes across all markers is
required for separating the mixture, and is found using
the MAP search algorithm described in § 4.
3.3

(i)

These nodes model the na variables introduced in (1).

Allele counting nodes

On the level below the genotype nodes for p1 and p2
is a set of nodes representing the number of alleles
(taking the value of 0, 1 or 2) of a certain type in
each individual. Thus, for example, the node p1 8
counts the number of alleles of repeat number 8 in the
genotype of individual p1 for the given marker: this
value only depends upon the genotype of the individual
p1 and hence there is an arrow from p1gt to p1 8.

3.5

True and observed weight nodes

These nodes are represented by the elliptical shapes.
The nodes 8 weight, 9 weight and x weight represent the true relative peak weights r8 , r9 and rx respectively of the alleles 8, 9 and x in the amplified DNA
sample. Each true-weight node is given a conditionalGaussian distribution as in (1), where the fraction θ
of DNA from p1 in the mixture is modelled in the
network by a discrete distribution in the node labelled
p1 frac. The variance is taken to be σ 2 µa . The nodes
8 weightobs, 9 weightobs and x weightobs represent the measured weights. The observed weight is
given a conditional-Gaussian distribution with mean
the true weight, and measurement variance ω 2 , hence
leading to the variance (3).
When using peak area information as evidence the
nodes representing the observed weights will have their
values set to the relative peak weights. The sym node
is only used for separating a mixture of two unknown
contributors, to break the symmetry between p1 and
p2 (see § 5.2).
3.6

Networks with more than one marker

The network displayed in Figure 2 generated by
Maies is for a single marker; for mixture problems
involving several markers the structure is similar but
more complex because the number of nodes grows with
the number of markers. In such a network the nodes
shaded in Figure 2 occur only once. The unshaded
nodes are replicated once for each marker, with each
node having text in their labels to identify the marker
that the allele or genotype nodes refer to. There will
also be extra repeat number, allele counting and allele
weight nodes in each marker having more than two
observed alleles in the mixture, extending the pattern
for the one-marker network in the obvious manner.

4

A simple MAP search algorithm

It is well known that the most likely configuration of a
set of discrete variables is not necessarily the same as
found by picking the most likely states in the individual marginals of the variables (see for example [16]).
The basis of the MAP search algorithm in Maies is to
assume that this is close.
Specifically, after entering and propagating evidence,
one finds the individual marginals of the set of MAP
variables M of interest. There are then two variants
of the MAP algorithm, batch and sequential.
In the batch variant, one finds for some reasonable
number n (say n = 5000) the top n most likely configurations of the joint probability given by the product of the individual marginals of MAP variables.
This is done by constructing a disconnected graph
in the MAP variables, and using the efficient algorithm of [17]. These configurations are stored in an
list (c1 , c2 , . . . , cn ) ordered by decreasing probability
according to the independence graph. Now returning to the original Bayesian network, one propagates
the available evidence E and finds the normalization
constant P (E) and stores this in rp, say (short for
“remainder probability”). One then processes the
(c1 , c2 , . . . , cn ) configurations as additional evidence in
the original Bayesian network and finds from the normalization constant each of their probabilities P (ci , E).
After processing each configuration, one keeps track
of the highest probability configuration found and its
probability, bp. One also subtracts p(ci , E) from rp,
so that if it ever happens bp > rp then the MAP
has been found. If one stores all of the probabilities
p(ci , E), i = 1, . . . , k for all of the configurations that
have been processed, then perhaps the second, third
etc. most likely configurations may
Pk be identified if
their probabilities exceed P (E) − i=1 P (ci , E). The
sequential variant proceeds similarly, the difference is
that the candidates c1 , c2 , . . ., are generated one at a
time as required. The following is pseudo-code for the
sequential variant for finding the MAP.

the second, third, fourth etc., most likely configurations.

A criminal case example

Our example is taken from Appendix B of [9] and illustrates the use of the amelogenin marker in the analysis
of DNA mixtures when the individual contributors are
of opposite sex.
Peak area analysis of the amelogenin marker in DNA
recovered from a condom used in a rape attack indicated an approximate 2:1 ratio for the amount of female to male DNA contributing to the mixture. Peak
area information was available on six other markers,
the information is shown in Table 1; we shall refer to
this as the Clayton data. (Further examples are illustrated in [12] and [18].)

the DNA profiles of both victim (v) and suspect (s).

For purely discrete networks, this algorithm does not
appear to be as efficient as that described in [16]. However it is neither clear that the latter can be applied to
finding the MAP of a set of discrete variables in a conditional Gaussian network, nor that it could identify

Evidential calculation

One possible use of the system to the Clayton data
would be to compare the two hypotheses:
• H0 : the suspect and victim both contributed to
the mixture
• H1 : the victim and an unknown contributor contributed to the mixture

In a courtroom setting, the null hypothesis, H0 , would
be a prosecution’s case, whilst H1 would represent the
defence’s case. (It is standard procedure in court for
likelihood ratios of these hypotheses to be reported.)

of genotypes of the two contributors to the mixture,
but other less likely but also plausible combinations.
Maies achieves this with the MAP search algorithm
described in § 4.

To do this calculation in Maies, evidence is entered
in the observed relative peak area nodes, the repeat
number nodes, and information on the suspect and
victim genotypes. After propagating the evidence the
marginal on the target is examined. This has the
following values (taken from Maies):

For separating a mixture, we may or may not have genetic information about one of the contributors. For
our rape example, suppose that we have the genotype
of the victim. Then using Maies we may enter as evidence the victim’s genotype, the relative peak areas
and the repeat number information. We also select the
value yes in the p2 = v? node. We then select the set
of joint genotype nodes, and perform the MAP search.
Maies returns two configuration, the most likely having posterior probability 0.997594, with the genotype
p1 matching our suspect profile in Table 1. The second
most likely combination has a posterior probability of
0.00239796, and differs from the true profile in the
marker FGA where a homozygous (22, 22) genotype
is predicted. All remaining possible genotype combinations have a total probability mass of less than
8 × 10−6 .

0.99999999992235.

From this the likelihood ratio of H0 to H1 is calculated
to be P (s and v | E)/P (s and u | E) = 2.73 × 1010 ,
where E denotes the complete set of evidence.
(Note that because we have placed
uniform priors on the nodes p1 = s?
and
p2 = v?, then P (E | s and v)/P (E | s and u)
=
P (s and v | E)/P (s and u | E).)
It may be that only DNA from a suspect is available,
but not from a victim. In such a situation we could
use Maies to compare the following two hypotheses:
• H0 : the suspect and an unknown contributor contributed to the mixture
• H1 : two unknown contributors contributed to the
mixture
Again in a courtroom setting these could represent
prosecution and defence cases respectively. The calculation proceeds as before, but with the victim profile
omitted from the evidence. This time the marginal on
the target node is given by

and the likelihood ratio of H0 vs. H1 is given by
P (s and u | E)/P (u1 and u2 | E) = 8.57 × 109 .
5.2

Mixture separation calculations

The other type of calculation that may be performed
with Maies is that of separating a two-person mixture
into genotypes of the contributors. The output from
such a decomposition could be used to find a match
in a DNA database search. For such a search it is
useful to have not just the most likely combination

The second possibility is that no genotypic information is available on either contributor to the mixture.
To do this calculation, evidence on the observed relative peak areas and the repeat number information
is entered. To overcome the symmetry in the network
between p1 and p2, we enter evidence on the sym node
that p1 frac is ≥ 0.5. Then, selecting the joint genotype nodes as before, we perform a MAP search. The
result is shown in Table 2. All markers are correctly
identified. Note in particular that the genotypes for
the marker THO are identified correctly. In [9] this
was only possible to do so after the victim’s profile
was taken into account.

contributors for Clayton data. The victim (here p1)
and male suspect (p2) is correctly identified on every

calibrating the variance parameters σ 2 and ω 2 . We
are pursuing ways that this could be accomplished using an EM estimation algorithm. (Bayesian methods
for estimating the variance parameters could also be
developed.) Nevertheless, despite these many issues,
we feel that the present framework provides a sound
foundation in which these and other matters can be
be addressed and incorporated into Maies.

has 183 discrete nodes and 54 continuous nodes. The

combinations of these nodes took approximately 38

distribution of the mixture proportion; the peak at
around 0.65 corresponds to a mixture ratio of 1.86:1,
in line with the approximate 2:1 estimated in [9].

Discussion

We have described a software system, Maies, for
analysing DNA mixtures using peak area information,
yielding a coherent way of predicting genotypes of unknown contributors and assessing evidence for particular individuals having contributed to the mixture, and
applied it to a real life example. A simple MAP search
algorithm allows a set of most plausible genotypes
to be generated, perhaps for use in a DNA database
search for a suspect.
There are a number of issues that would need addressing before the system could be used in routine analysis
of casework, for example, complications such as more
than two potential contributors, multiple traces, indirect genotypic evidence, stutter, etc. In addition,
preliminary investigations seem to indicate that the
variance factor depends critically on the total amount
of DNA available for analysis. As this necessarily is
varying from case to case, a calibration study should
be performed to take this properly into account. Methods for diagnostic checking and validation of the model
should be developed based upon comparing observed
weights to those predicted when genotypes are as-

Some genetic background

Every cell nucleus of a person contains 46 chromosomes, which can be grouped into 22 distinguishable
pairs of so called autosomal chromosomes, and one
pair of sex-linked chromosomes (in men the latter is
denoted by XY , in women by XX).
Each chromosome consists of a sequence of large
molecules called nucleotides, there being four nucleotides in all (these are adenine, cytosine, guanine
and thymine). Genes are particular subsequences in
the paired chromosomes; any specific gene is associated with a specific chromosome at a particular position called a locus (hence there are two genes at a locus
of a chromosome pair). A gene used in forensic identification at a particular locus is called a marker. Short
tandem repeat (STR) markers are a particular type
of marker favoured by forensic scientists in identifying
people using nuclear DNA. They consist of repeated
sequences of molecules called base-pairs, a single sequence consists of a small number of base-pairs. A
marker may have one of a (finite) number of alternative molecular compositions, called alleles. The allele
number or repeat number of an allele counts how many
copies of a repeated sequence it consists of. Thus for
example, allele 8 of the VWA marker system is an allele with eight repeats of a base-pair sequence. Allele
numbers that are not integers indicate that one of the
repeated sequences is not complete. For example, allele 9.3 of the VWA system contains nine repeats of
a base-pair sequence plus a subsequence of three base
pairs. The number of possible alleles will vary according to the particular marker. An unordered pair of
alleles is associated with each marker. One of these
is inherited from the father, and is called the paternal
gene, the other is inherited from the mother and is
called the maternal gene. This pair is called the genotype. If the pair of alleles has the same repeat number,
then the genotype is called homozygous, otherwise it
is called heterozygous.
The various alleles of a particular marker do not occur
with equal frequency among the members of a population. By making DNA measurements of many individuals in a population the relative frequencies of alleles
in a population may be estimated.
