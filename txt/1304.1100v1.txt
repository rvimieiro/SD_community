Abstract

In this paper we present a framework
for dynamically constructing Bayesian net­
works. We introduce the notion of a back­
ground knowledge base of �chemata, �hich
.
is a collection of parameterized conditiOnal
probability statements. These schemata
explicitly separate the general knowledge of
properties an individual may have from the
specific knowledge of particular individuals
that may have these properties. Knowledge
of individuals can be combined with this
background knowledge to create Bayesian
networks, which can then be used in any
propagation scheme.
We discuss the theory and assumptions
necessary for the implementation of dy­
namic Bayesian networks, and indicate
where our approach may be useful.

Motivation

Bayesian networks are used in AI applications to
model uncertainty and perform inference. They
are often used in expert systems [Andreassen et
al., 1987], and decision analysis[Schachter, 1988,
Howard and Matheson, 1981], in which the network
is engineered to perform a highly specialized analysis
task.
A Bayesian network often implicitly combines gen­
eral knowledge with specific knowledge. For exam­
ple, a Bayesian network with an arc as in Figure 1
refers to a specific individual (a house or a tree or
dinner or whatever), exhibiting a somewhat gener­
alized property (fire causes smoke).
Our dynamic approach is m �tivated by the '?b­
servation that a knowledge engmeer has expertise
in a domain, but may not be able to anticipate t.he
individuals in the model. By separating properties
from individuals the knowledge engineer can write
a knowledge base which is independent of the in� i­
viduals; the system user can tell the system which

individuals to consider, because she can make this
observation at run time. The system user doesn't
have to be an expert in the domain, to create an
appropriate network.
As an example, suppose we are using Bayesian
networks to model probabilistically the response of
several people to the sound of an alarm. Our ap­
proach allows the observation of any number of peo­
ple. The same knowledge about how people respond
to alarms is used for each person.
There are two parts to our approach. First, we
provide a collection of schemata, which are param­
.
eterized, and can be used when necessary given
.the
details of the problem. In particular, the same piece
of knowledge may be instantiated several times in a
single dynamically created network.
Second an automatic process bmlds a Bayesian
network by combining the observation of individu­
als with the schemata. Thus, if we want to reason
about a situation involving a fire alarm, given that
three different people all hear the same alarm, this
information, provided as evidence to our inference
engine, causes the appropriate network to be cre­
ated.
The Bayesian network constructed dynami­
cally can absorb evidence (conditioning) to P ro­
.
vide posterior probabilities using any propagatiOn
scheme[Pearl, 1988, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter,
1988, Schachter, 1988].
We now proceed with a cursory introduction to
Bayesian networks, followed by a presentation of our
dynamic approach, giving some examples of how dy­
namic networks can be used. Finally, we draw some
conclusions concerning the applicability of dynamic
networks to particular domains.

Bayesian Networks

A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph which
represents in graphical form the joint probability dis­
tribution, and the statistical independence assump­
tions, for a set of random variables.
A node in the graph represents a variable, and an
arc indicates that the node at the head of the arc is
directly dependent on, or conditioned by the node at

the tail. The collection of arcs directed to a variable
give the independenc� assu�ption� for the. de�en­
dent variable. Associated with this collection IS a
prior probability distribution, or contingency table,
which quantifies the effects of observing events for
the conditioning variables on the probability of the
dependent variable.
The graphical representation is used in various
ways to calculate posterior joint probabilities. Pearl
[Pearl, 1988] uses the arcs to propagate � ausal
and diagnostic support values throughout a smgly­
connected network. Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter
[Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988] perform evi­
dence absorption and propagation by constructing
a triangulated graph based on the Bayesian net­
work that models the domain knowledge. Schachter
[Schachter, 1988] uses the arcs to perform node re­
duction on the network.I Poole and Neufeld [Poole
and Neufeld, 1989] implement an axiomatization of
probability theory in Prolog which uses the arcs of
the network to calculate probabilities using "reason­
ing by cases" with the conditioning variables. Our
current implementation uses the work of Poole and
Neufeld, but is not dependent on it.

Representation Issues

Creating networks automatically raises several issues
which we discuss in this section. First, we need to
represent our background knowledge in a way which
preserves a coherent joint distribution defined by
Bayesian networks, and which also facilitates its use
in arbitrary situations. Furthermore, there are sit­
uations in which using the background knowledge
may lead to ambiguity, and our approach must also
deal with this.
Before we get into our discussion, a short section
dealing with syntactic conventions will help make
things clearer.
3.1

Some syntax

In this section we clarify the distinction between our
background knowledge and Bayesian networks.
1Schachter's influence diagrams contain decision and
test nodes, as well as other devices not being considered
in this paper. We are only looking at probabilistic nodes
at present.

Figure 2: A simple instantiation of a schema.
In our Bayesian networks, random variables are
propositions written like ground Prolog terms. For
example, the random variable fties{e127} cou.ld rep­
resent the proposition that individual e127 fhes.
A schema is part of the background knowledge
base, and describes qualitatively the direct depen­
dencies of a random variable. In this paper, a
schema is stated declaratively in sans serif font.
A schema can be defined constructively: a param­
eterized atom is written as a Prolog term with pa­
rameters capitalized. A schema is represented by the
following:
... , Bn -->b
where the arrow � indicates that the parameter­
ized atom, b, on the left side is directly dependent
on the parameterized atoms, ai, on the right.
An instantiation of a parameter is the substitution
of a parameter by a constant representing an indi­
vidual. We indicate this in our examples by listing
the individuals in a set, as in {el27}. Instantiating a
parameterized atom creates a proposition that can
be used in a Bayesian network.
A schema is instantiated when all parameters have
been instantiated, and an instantiated schema be­
comes a part of the Bayesian network, indicating a
directed arc from the instantiation. of each ai and
the instantiation of b.
For example, the schema:
a1,

foo(Xa), bar(a) - foobar (X)
{b}
instantiating
the parameter X, creates the
with
network2 shown in Figure 2.
The schemata in the background knowledge
base are isolated pieces of information, whereas a
Bayesian network is a single entity. An interpreta­
tion is that a Bayesian network defines a joint distri­
bution, whereas the schemata in a knowledge base
2In our examples, Bayesian networks are pictured as
encircled node labels connected by directed arrows, as in

define conditional probability factors of which in­
stances are used to compute a joint probability dis­
tribution.
A schema is incomplete without the contingency
table which quantifies the connection between the
dependent variable and its conditioning parents. 3
These tables have the following form, and follow
the same syntactic assumptions as the symbolic
schemata:
=
p(foobar(X) I foo(X.a), bar(a))
0.95
=
0.666
p(foobar(X) I foo(X.a), -,bar(a))
=
p(foobar(X) I -,foo(X.a), bar(a))
0.25
p(foobar(X) I -,foc(X.a), -,bar(a)) = 0.15
By writing a parameterized schema, we are licens­
ing a construction process to instantiate the param­
eters in the schema for any individual. This requires
that the knowledge we provide as schemata must be
written generally.
The parameters in the schema and the contingent
probability information should not be interpreted
with any kind of implicit quantification. Rather,
they are intended to apply to a "typical" individ­
ual. Furthermore, when this parameterized infor­
mation is used, the parameters should be replaced
with constants which do not convey any intrinsic in­
formation. By designing schemata carefully, we can
avoid the "Ace of Spades" problem [Schubert, 1988].

Dynamic Instantiation

I

A general schema with parameters can be instanti­
ated for more than one individual. There are three
cases:

I

Unique schemata
These are schema which have no parameters, or
which have the same parameters occurring on both
sides of the arc. For example:
a(X), b -+c(X).
For the constants {x,y} instantiating the parameter
X, the network building process puts two arcs in our
network, as in Figure 3.

4.1

Right-multiple schemata
In the second case, there are parameters on the right
side of the schema which do not occur on the left
side, as in a,b -+c(Y). (Note that, in addition, there
may be parameters which occur on both sides of the
arc ). Instantiating the parameter Y in the above
schema with values {x, y, z} creates the network
shown in Figure 4.
Example 4-1:

presents an extended example, about burglar alarms
and testimonies from several people, a.s motivation
for the use of Bayesian networks in an automated

reasoning system. The following schemata can spec­
ify this problem:
burglary, earthquake - alarm..sound
- newsJepat
earthquake
- testimony(X)
alarm..sound
alarm..sound
- caii(Y)
Note the use of right-multiple schemata. This allows
us to specify multiple cases for testimonies from dif­
ferent people. In particular, we could tell the system
that we are investigating the hypothesis that a bur­
glary occurred based on testimonies from Dr Watson
and Mrs Gibbons. people, by supplying the con­
stants representing these individuals at run time. D

of the fire alarm may cause others to leave the build­
ing.
This situation shows the usefulness of an existen­
tial combination over individuals in the problem. We
want to combine the effects of each individual into
a single variable which relates the likelihood that at
least one of the individuals satisfied the condition.
The following schema represents this notion syntac­
tically:

·

3Xetype·a(X) -+b.
The existential schema serves as a short-hand no­
tation for a dynamic Or-rule structure. For exam­
ple, when it is given that {xl, .x2, . . , xn} are mem­
bers of the set type, the schema above expands into a
network structure as in Figure 6, where the contin­
gency table for 3Xetype.a(X) is unity if any of a(X) is
known to be true, and zero if they are all false. The
Or-rule is indicated in the diagram by the circular
arc on the inputs to the existential node.
This schema requires a contingency table such as:
.

the parameterized left-multiple schema from Sec­
tion 4.3.

4.3

Left-multiple schemata

The remaining case is characterized by parameters
occurring on the left side of the schema which do not
occur on the right side. For example:

a(X) -+b
Instantiating the parameter X with a number o f in­
dividuals {xl, . . , xn} creates a network structure as
shown in Figure 5 . The conditional probability for
b must be stated in terms of multiple instances of
the node a(X). To use the multiple instantiation of a
left-multiple schema, we need to be able to provide
contingencies for any arbitrary number of individ­
uals. This is problematic because it is not reason­
able to provide this kind of information (in terms
of contingency tables, for example), as background
knowledge: we would require a table for every possi­
ble set of individuals. To be useful, the contingency
tables for left-multiple schemata must allow for any
number of instantiations.

p( b I -.3XEtype·a(X))

Existential Combination
Consider the following example: A person who
smells smoke may set off a fire alarm, and the sound

=

which describes the effect on b for the case where
at least one known individual satisfies a(X), and the
case where no known individual does (these numbers
are arbitrary).
Example 4-2:
The example about fire alarms,
given at the beginning of this section, can be repre­
sented by the following background knowledge base:

fire
smells..smoke(X)
3YEperson·sets.Dff..alarm(Y)
alari'TUounds

- smells.smoke(X)
- sets_off..alarrr(X)
- alarnuound s
- leaves..building(Z)
Suppose we are given that john and mary are the
only known members of the set person. This infor­
mation creates the network shown in Figure 7. 0
There are several points which should be made:

1. The variable 3XEtype·a(X) is propositional, and
when it is true, it should be interpreted as the
fact that some known individual satisfies the
proposition a(X). When this existential com­
bination is false, the interpretation should be
that no known individual satisfies the proposi­
tion a(X), although there may be an individual
satisfying the proposition who is unknown to
the system.

It would be representationally restrictive to disal­
low the use of left-multiple schemata, because some­
times we do want to allow an unspecified number of
variables to condition a dependent variable. For ex­
ample, we may want to include in our knowledge
base the idea that any number of people may call
the fire department to report a fire.
We provide two mechanisms, called existential
and universal combination, which specify how an
unknown number of possible conditioning variables
affects another variable. These are based on the
Canonical Models of Multicausal Interactions sug­
gested by Pearl [Pearl, 1988].

The proposition 3Xetype·a(X) can be considered
a schema on it's own, acting like a variable
which is disjunctively influenced by a(c) for ev­
ery constant c in the set type. The intermedi­
ate Bayesian arcs are not written as part of the
knowledge base.

3. The set type, from which the individuals for this
schema are taken, serves two purposes: to con­
strain the applicability of the individuals to the

schema, and to facilitate the dynamic specifi­
cation of individuals. In this way, all and only
those individuals who are known to satisfy the
type requirement will be included in this com­
bination.

Universal combination can be used in situations
for which all individuals of a certain type must sat­
isfy a condition to affect a consequent. For example,
a board of directors meeting can begin only when all
the members who are going to come are present.

I

We represent this idea with a schema with the
following syntax:

I

The discussion concerning the existential combi­
nation applies here, with the only exception be­
ing the interpretation of the schema. The variable
VXetype·a(X) is true if a(X) is true for every mem­
ber of the set type. We treat the combination as a
dynamic And-rule over all members of the set type.
The And-rule contingency table is unity if all the

We note that at the time the schemata are written,
it is not important to know how many board mem­

who is a member on the board before the network
can be created. This information is supplied at run
time, and the construction process can construct the

Creating Bayesian networks

To create a Bayesian network, the schemata in our
knowledge base must be combined with the individ­
uals the process knows about. The process by which
this is accomplished in our implementation has been
kept simple, and syntactic.
Every schema in the knowledge base is instanti­
ated by substituting ground atoms representing the
individuals known to be part of the model. Each in­
stantiation of a schema is an arc in the Bayesian net­
work. The contingency table associated with each
schema is also instantiated, providing the prior prob­
ability information we require.
This procedure creates the collection of Bayesian
arcs we use as the Bayesian network for our model.

Current and Future Work

These proceedings report simultaneous and indepen­
dent research on building Bayesian networks dynam­
ically. Goldman and Charniak [Goldman and Char­
niak, 1990] use a sophisticated rule base to construct
Bayesian networks using more 'semantic' knowledge.
As well, their approach handles cases where arcs are
added to a ·network which has already absorbed ev­
idence.
We have outlined only two ways in which the ef­
fects of an unknown number of individuals can be
combined. These could be extended to include other
types of combination.
This paper describes how knowledge of individuals
can be used to create a Bayesian network. There are
times when we want to use observations about the
individuals to add arcs to the network. For instance,
observing the topology of an electronic circuit should

help structure the Bayesian network which models
the uncertainty in diagnosing faults. These obser­
vations have a unusual property: they can be used
to structure a network if they are observed to be
true, and yield no exploitable structural information
if they are observed false. We are looking at how we
might implement this idea.
The process, described in this paper, which cre­
ates the Bayesian network from the knowledge base
is very simple, and many improvements could be
made. One way to limit the size of our networks
is to delay the creation of the network until all the
evidence available has been observed. This would
allow the exploitation of conditional independence
at the level of the structure of the network, mak­
ing the network smaller and easier to evaluate. This
idea is not exploited by many systems (for example,
Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [Lauritzen and Spiegel-

halter,

4-2

1988] mention the idea, but

I
argue against it) .

The ideas in this paper have been implemented
and tested using toy problems. Currently, larger
applications are being built in more sophisticated
domains, including circuit diagnosis and the inter­
pretation of sketch maps.

Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a dynamic ap­
proach to the use of Bayesian networks which sepa­
rates background and specific knowledge. Bayesian
networks are created by combining parameterized
schemata with the knowledge of individuals in the
model.
Our approach to the use of Bayesian networks
has been from the viewpoint of providing an auto­
mated tool for probabilistic reasoning, and is useful

for modelling problems for domains in which many
details of the problem cannot be exhaustively antic­
ipated by the designer of the probabilistic model.
Such domains include expert systems, diagnosis,
story understanding, natural language processing
and others.
An implementation of this approach has been
completed in Prolog.
