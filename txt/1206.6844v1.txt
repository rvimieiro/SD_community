Abstract
There exist several architectures to solve influence diagrams using local computations,
such as the Shenoy-Shafer, the HUGIN, or
the Lazy Propagation architectures. They all
extend usual variable elimination algorithms
thanks to the use of so-called “potentials”.
In this paper, we introduce a new architecture, called the Multi-operator Cluster DAG
architecture, which can produce decompositions with an improved constrained inducedwidth, and therefore induce potentially exponential gains. Its principle is to benefit from
the composite nature of influence diagrams,
instead of using uniform potentials, in order
to better analyze the problem structure.

INTRODUCTION

Since the first algorithms based on decision trees or
arc-reversal operations [Shachter, 1986], several exact
methods have been proposed to solve influence diagrams using local computations, such as the ones based
on the Shenoy-Shafer, the HUGIN, or the Lazy Propagation architectures [Shenoy, 1992; Jensen et al., 1994;
Madsen and Jensen, 1999]. These methods have successfully adapted classical Variable Elimination (VE)
techniques (which are basically designed to compute
one type of marginalization on a combination of local
functions with only one type of combination operator), in order to handle the multiple types of information (probabilities and utilities), the multiple types
of marginalizations (sum and max), and the multiple
types of combination (× for probabilities, + for utilities) involved in an influence diagram. The key mechanism used for such an extension consists in using elements known as potentials [Ndilikilikesha, 1994].
In this paper, we define a new architecture, called the
Multi-operator Cluster DAG (MCDAG) architecture,

which does not use potentials, but still relies on VE.
Compared to existing schemes, MCDAGs actively exploit the composite nature of influence diagrams. We
first present the potential-based approach and motivate the need for a new architecture (Section 2). Then,
MCDAGs are introduced (Section 3) and a VE algorithm is defined (Section 4). Finally, this work is
compared with existing approaches (Section 5) and extended to other frameworks (Section 6). All proofs are
available in [Pralet et al., 2006b].

MOTIVATIONS

Notations and definitions An influence diagram [Howard and Matheson, 1984] is a composite
graphical model defined on three sets of variables organized in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) G: (1) a set
C of chance variables x ∈ C, for each of which a conditional probability distribution Px | pa(x) on x given its
parents in G is specified; (2) a set D = {D1 , . . . , Dq }
(indices represent the order in which decisions are
made) of decision variables x ∈ D, for each of which
pa(x) is the set of variables observed before decision
x is made; (3) a set Γ of utility variables u ∈ Γ, each
of which is associated with a utility function Upa(u) on
pa(u) (and utility variables are leaves in the DAG).
We consider influence diagrams where the parents of a
decision variable are parents of all subsequent decision
variables (no-forgetting). The set of conditional probability distributions (one for each x ∈ C) is denoted
P and the set of utility functions (one for each u ∈ Γ)
is denoted U . Each function φ ∈ P ∪ U holds on a set
of variables sc(φ) called its scope, and is consequently
called a scoped function (sc(Px | pa(x) ) = {x} ∪ pa(x)
and sc(Upa(u) ) = pa(u)). The set of chance variables
observed before the first decision is denoted I0 , the
set of chance variables observed between decisions Dk
and Dk+1 is denoted Ik , and the set of chance variables unobserved before the last decision is denoted
Iq . We use dom(x) to denote the domain of a vari-

able x ∈ C Q
∪ D, and by extension, for W ⊂ C ∪ D,
dom(W ) = x∈W dom(x).

The usual problem associated with an influence diagram is to find decision rules maximizing the expected
utility (a decision rule for a decision Dk is a function
associating a value in dom(Dk ) with any assignment
of the variables observed before making decision Dk )
As shown in [Jensen et al., 1994], this is equivalent to
computing optimal decision rules for the quantity

THE “POTENTIAL” APPROACH

With this approach, Equation 1 is reformulated using
so-called potentials in order to use only one combination and one marginalization operator. A potential on
a set of variables W is a pair πW = (pW , uW ), where
pW and uW are respectively a nonnegative real function and a real function, whose scopes are included
in W . The initial conditional probability distributions
Pi ∈ P are transformed into potentials (Pi , 0), whereas
the initial utility functions Ui ∈ U are transformed into
potentials (1, Ui ). On these potentials, a combination
operation ⊗ and a marginalization (or elimination)
operation ↑ are defined:
• the combination of πW1 = (pW1 , uW1 ) and πW2 =
(pW2 , uW2 ) is the potential on W1 ∪ W2 given by
πW1 ⊗ πW2 = (pW1 × pW2 , uW1 + uW2 );
• the marginalization of πW = (pP
W , uW ) over
 W1 ⊂
P
↑W1

(with

the convention 0/0 = 0), whereas the marginalization of πW = (pW , uW ) over W1 ⊂ D is given
↑W1
by πW
= (pW , maxW1 uW ).

Solving the problem associated with an influence
diagram is then equivalent to computing β =
((· · · ((πC∪D ↑Iq )↑Dq )↑Iq−1 · · · )↑D1 )↑I0 , where πC∪D =
(⊗Pi ∈P (Pi , 0)) ⊗ (⊗Ui ∈U (1, Ui )) is the combination of
the initial potentials. As ⊗ and ↑ satisfy the ShenoyShafer axioms defined in [Shenoy, 1990], β can be computed using usual VE algorithms [Jensen et al., 1994].
This explains why existing architectures like ShenoyShafer, HUGIN, or Lazy Propagation (LP1 ) use potentials to solve influence diagrams.
2.2

QUANTIFYING THE COMPLEXITY

In the case of influence diagrams, the alternation of
sum and max marginalizations, which do not gener1

pairs of set of functions (instead of pairs of functions).

ally commute, prevents from eliminating variables in
any order. The complexity of VE can then be quantified using constrained induced-width [Jensen et al.,
1994; Park and Darwiche, 2004] (instead of inducedwidth [Dechter and Fattah, 2001]).
Definition 1. Let G = (VG , HG ) be a hypergraph2
and let  be a partial order on VG . The constrained
induced-width of G with constraints on the elimination
order given by  (“x ≺ y” stands for “y must be eliminated before x”) is a parameter denoted wG (). It is
defined as wG () = mino∈lin() wG (o), lin() being
the set of linearizations of  to a total order on VG and
wG (o) being the induced-width of G for the elimination
order o (i.e. the size of the largest hyperedge created
when eliminating variables in the order given by o).
The constrained induced-width can be used to give an
upper bound on the complexity of existing potentialbased VE algorithms. Let Gp = (C ∪ D, {sc(φ)|φ ∈
P ∪ U }) be the hypergraph corresponding to the “untyped” influence diagram. Let p be the partial order
defined by I0 ≺p D1 , (Ik 6= ∅) → (Dk ≺p Ik ≺p Dk+1 ),
and Dq ≺p Iq . Finally, let d be the maximum size of
the variables domains. Then, with classical approaches
based on potentials and strong junction trees [Jensen
et al., 1994], which are junction trees with constraints
on the marginalization order, the theoretical complexity is O(|P ∪ U | · d1+wGp (p ) ) (the number of elements
of a finite set E is denoted |E|).
2.3

DECREASING THE CONSTRAINED
INDUCED-WIDTH

The constrained-induced width is a guideline to show
how the complexity can be decreased. In this direction, one can work on the two parameters on which it
depends: the partial order , and the hypergraph G.
Weakening the partial order 
Proposition 1. Let G = (VG , HG ) be a hypergraph
and let 1 , 2 be two partial orders on VG such that
∀(x, y) ∈ VG × VG , (x 2 y) → (x 1 y) (2 is weaker
than 1 ). Then, wG (1 ) ≥ wG (2 ).
Proposition 1 means that if one weakens , i.e. if one
reveals some extra freedoms in the elimination order
(e.g. by proving that some marginalizations with sum
and max can commute), then the theoretical complexity may decrease. Though such a technique is known
to be useless in contexts like Maximum A Posteriori
hypothesis [Park and Darwiche, 2004], where there is
only one alternation of max and sum marginalizations,
2

This means that VG is the set of variables (or vertices),
and HG is a set of hyperedges on VG , i.e. a subset of 2VG .

it can lead to an exponential gain as soon as there are
more than two levels of alternation.
Indeed, assume
that one wants
P to compute
P
maxx1 ,...,xn y maxxn+1 Py (Ux1 ,y + 1≤i≤n Uxi ,xn+1 ).
On one hand, using 1 defined by {x1 , . . . , xn } ≺1
y ≺1 xn+1 provides us with the constrained inducedwidth wG (1 ) = n, since xn+1 is then necessarily
eliminated first. On the other hand, the scopes of
the functions involved enable us to infer that with 2
defined by x1 ≺2 y, one is guaranteed to compute the
same value, since y is “linked” only with x1 . The constrained induced-width is then wG (2 ) = 1, e.g. with
the elimination order x1 ≺ y ≺ xn+1 ≺ xn ≺ . . . ≺ x2 .
Therefore, the theoretical complexity decreases from
O((n + 2) · dn+1 ) to O((n + 2) · d2 ), thanks to the
weakening of the partial order (the (n + 2) factor
corresponds to the number of scoped functions).
Working on the hypergraph The second
possible mechanism is to work on the hypergraph G, either by eliminating
so-called “barren”
P
variables (computing
x Px | pa(x) is useless because of normalization), or by better decomposing
the problem.
To illustrate the latter, P
assume
that one wants to compute maxx1 ,...,xn y Py ·
(Uy,x1 + · · · + Uy,xn ). The basic hypergraph G1 =
({x1 , . . . , xn , y}, {{y, x1}, . . . , {y, xn }}), together with
1 defined by {x1 , . . . , xn } ≺1 y, gives a theoretical
complexity O((n + 1) · dwG1 (1 )+1 ) = O((n + 1) · dn+1 ).
However, one can write:
P
maxx1 ,...,xn y Py · (Uy,x1 + · · · + Uy,xn )
P
P
= (maxx1 y Py · Uy,x1 ) + · · · + (maxxn y Py · Uy,xn )
Thus, an implicit duplication of y makes the complexity decrease to O((n + 1)d2 ) = O((n + 1)d1+wG2 (2 ) ),
where G2 is the hypergraph defined by the variables {x1 , . . . , xn , y (1) , . . . , y (n) } and by the hyperedges
{{x1 , y (1) }, . . . , {xn , y (n) }}, and where 2 is given by
x1 ≺2 y (1) , . .P
. , xn ≺2 y (n) . This
P method,Pwhich uses
the property S (U1 + U2 ) = ( S U1P
) +( S U2 ), duplicates variables “quantified” with , so that computations become more local. Proposition 2 shows the
possible exponential gain obtained by duplication.
Proposition 2. Let φx,Si be a scoped function of
scope {x} ∪ Si P
for any i ∈ [1, m]. The direct
computation of
x (φx,S1 + · · · + φx,Sm ) always requires
more
sums
than
P the direct computation of
P
·
·
·
+
(
( x φx,S1 ) +
x φx,Sm ). Moreover, the comP
putation of x (φx,S1 + · · · + φx,Sm ) results in a complexity O(m · d1+|S1 ∪...∪Sm | ), whereas
P the computation
of the m quantities in the set { x φx,Si | 1 ≤ i ≤ m}
results in a complexity O(m · d1+maxi∈[1,m] |Si | ).
Why not use potentials? Though weakening the
constraints on the elimination order could be done

with potentials, the duplication mechanism cannot
be used if potentials are. Indeed, one cannot write
↑W3
↑W3
(πW1 ⊗ πW2 )↑W3 = (πW
) ⊗ (πW
) even if W3 ⊂ C.

The duplication mechanism has actually already been
proposed in the influence diagram litterature [Dechter,
2000] where it was applied ”on the fly” during elimination. In this paper, the duplication is exploited in a
global preliminary analysis which may reveal new degrees of freedom in the elimination order, in synergism
with the application of other mechanisms. The new architecture we introduce, which does not use potentials
to solve influence diagrams, is called the Multi-operator
Cluster DAG (MCDAG) architecture.

3.1

THE MCDAG ARCHITECTURE
MACROSTRUCTURING AN
INFLUENCE DIAGRAM

The first step to build the MCDAG architecture is to
analyze the macrostructure of the influence diagram,
by detecting the possible reordering freedoms in the
elimination order, while using the duplication technique and the normalization conditions on conditional
probability distributions. This macrostructure is represented with a DAG of computation nodes.
Definition 2. An atomic computation node n is a
scoped function φ in P ∪ U . In this case, the value of
n is val(n) = φ, and its scope is sc(n) = sc(φ). A computation node is either an atomic computation node or
a triple n = (Sov, ~, N ), where Sov is a sequence of
operator-variables pairs, ~ is an associative and commutative operator with an identity, and where N is a
set of computation nodes. In the latter, the value of n
is given by val(n) = Sov (~n0 ∈N val(n0 )), and its scope
is given by sc(n) = (∪n0 ∈N sc(n0 )) − {x | opx ∈ Sov}.
Informally, a computation node (Sov, ~, N ) defines a
sequence of marginalizations on a combination of computation nodes with a specific operator. It can be
represented as in Figure 1. Given a set of computation nodes N , we define N +x (resp. N −x ) as the
set of nodes of N whose scope contains x (resp. does
not contain x): N +x = {n ∈ N | x ∈ sc(n)} (resp.
N −x = {n ∈ N | x ∈
/ sc(n)}).

Macrostructuring the initial node

In order to exhibit the macrostructure of the influence
diagram, we analyze the sequence of computations performed by n0 . To do so, we successively consider the
eliminations in Sov0 from the right to the left and use
three types of rewriting rules, preserving nodes values, to make the macrostructure explicit: (1) decomposition rules, which decompose the structure using
namely the duplication technique; (2) recomposition
rules, which reveal freedoms in the elimination order;
(3) simplification rules, which remove useless computations from the architecture, by using normalization
conditions. Rewriting rules are presented first for the
case of sum-marginalizations, and then for the case of
max-marginalizations. A rewriting rule may be preceded by preconditions restricting its applicability.

P the rules). Then, DΣ can be
applied again for
r2 . One can infer from the obtained architecture that there is no reason for r1 to be

tial-based approach, it would be necessary to process

eliminated first, and r2 would be involved in the potentials (Pr2 |r1 , 0), (1, Ud,r2 ) if eliminated first).

Example In the example of Figure 3, one first applies the decomposition rule Dmax , in order to treat the
operator-variable pair maxd3 . Such a rule uses first the
monotonicity of + (max(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c)),
and then both the distributivity of × over + and
the monotonicity of × (so as to write things like
maxd3 ((Pr1 · Pr2 |r1 · Ud2 ,d3 ) + (Pr1 · Pr2 |r1 · Ur2 ,d1 ,d3 )) =
·maxd3 (Ud2 ,d3 +Ur2 ,d1 ,d3 )). Then, DΣ can be

used for r1 , and Dmax can be used for maxd2 . After
those steps, the recomposition rule Rmax , which uses
the monotonicities of × and +, reveals that the elimination order between d2 and d3 is actually free. This
was not obvious from the initial Sov sequence. The
approach using potentials is unable to make such freedoms explicit, which may induce exponential increase
in complexity as shown in 2.3.

tions like x1 ,...,xn can be split into x1 · · · xn ).
If the rightmost marginalization

the root node is x , then rule DΣ is applied once. It
creates new grandchildren nodes for the root, for each

of which, we try to apply rule RΣ in order to reveal
freedoms in the elimination order. If RΣ is applied,
this creates new computation nodes, on each of which

simplification rules SΣ
and then SΣ
are applied (until
they cannot be applied anymore).
If the rightmost marginalization in the Sov sequence of
the root node is maxx , then rule Dmax is applied once.
This creates a new child and a new grandchild for the
root. For the created grandchild, we try to weaken
constraints on the elimination order using Rmax .
Therefore, the rewriting rules are applied in a deterministic order, except from the freedom left when
choosing the next variable
in S to consider for
P
marginalizations like S or maxS . It can be shown
that this freedom does not change the final structure.
The soundness of the macrostructure obtained is provided by the soundness of the rewriting rules:

it possible to save some tests during the application

TOWARDS MCDAGS

The rewriting rules enable us to transform the initial multi-operator computation node n0 into a DAG
of mono-operator
P computation nodes looking like
(maxS , +, N ), ( S , ×, N ), (∅,
P×, N ), or φ ∈ P ∪ U .
For nodes (maxS , +, N ) or ( S , ×, N ), it is time to
use freedoms in the elimination order. To do so, usual
junction tree construction techniques can be used,
since on one hand, (R, max, +) and (R, +, ×) are commutative semirings, and since on the other hand, there
are no constraints on the elimination order inside each
of these nodes (the only slight difference with usual
junction trees is that only a subset of the variables
involved in a computation node may have to be eliminated, but it is quite easy to cope with this).
To obtain a goodPdecomposition for nodes n like
(maxS , +, N ) or ( S , ×, N ), one can build a junction tree to eliminate S from the hypergraph G =

(sc(N ), {sc(n0 ) | n0 ∈ N }). The optimal induced-width
which can be obtained for n is w(n) = wG,S , the
induced-width of G for the elimination of the variables in S.3 The induced-width of the MCDAG architecture is then defined by wmcdag = maxn∈N w(n),
where
P N is the set of nodes looking like (maxS , +, N )
or ( S , ×, N ).
After the decomposition of each mono-operator computation node, one obtains a Multi-operator Cluster
DAG.
Definition 3. A Multi-operator Cluster DAG is a
DAG where every vertex c (called a cluster) is labeled
with four elements: a set of variables V (c), a set of
scoped functions Ψ(c) taking values in a set E, a set
of son clusters Sons(c), and a couple (⊕c , ⊗c ) of operators on E s.t. (E, ⊕c , ⊗c ) is a commutative semiring.

of
a

c of a MCDAG is given by val(c)
=

⊕c V (c)−V (pa(c)) ⊗c ψ∈Ψ(c) ψ ⊗c ⊗c s∈Sons(c) val(s) .
The value of a MCDAG is the value of its root node.
Thanks to Proposition 7, working on MCDAGs is sufficient to solve influence diagrams.
Proposition 7. The value of the MCDAG obtained
after having decomposed the macrostructure is equal
to the maximal expected utility. Moreover, for any decision variable Dk , the set of optimal decision rules
for Dk in the influence diagram is equal to the set of
optimal decision rules for Dk in the MCDAG.
3.3

MERGING SOME COMPUTATIONS

There may exist MCDAG clusters performing exactly
the same computations, even if the computation nodes
they come from are
Pdistinct. For instance, a computation node n1 = ( x,y , ×, {Px , Py|x , Uy,z ) may be decomposed into clusters c1 = ({x}, {Px , Py|x }, ∅, (+, ×))
0
and c01 = ({y},
P {Uy,z }, {c1 }, (+, ×)). A computation
node n2 = ( x,y , ×, {Px , Py|x , Uy,t ) may be decomposed into clusters c2 = ({x}, {Px , Py|x }, ∅, (+, ×))
and c02 = ({y}, {Uy,t}, {c02 }, (+, ×)). As c1 = c2 , some
computations can be saved by merging clusters c1 and
c2 in the MCDAG. Detecting common clusters is not
as easy as detecting common computation nodes.
3

For (maxS , +, N ) nodes, which actually always look
like (maxS , +, {(∅, ×, N 0 ), N 0 ∈ N}), better decompositions can be obtained by using another hypergraph. In
fact, for each N 0 ∈ N, there exists a unique n ∈ N 0 ,
denoted N 0 [u], s.t. n or its children involve a utility
function. It is then better to consider the hypergraph
(sc(N ), {sc(N 0 [u]) | N 0 ∈ N}). This enables to figure out
that e.g. only two variables (x and y) must be considered if one eliminates x first in a node like (maxxy , +, N ) =
(maxxy , +, {(∅, ×, Uy,z ), (∅, ×, {nz , Ux,y }), (∅, ×, {nz , Ux })}),
since nz is a factor of both Ux,y and Ux . We do not further
develop this technical point.

this notion is not used only for decision rules conciseness reasons: it is also used to reveal reordering freedoms, which can decrease the time complexity. Note that some of the ordering freedom here
is obtained by synergism with the duplication.

To sum up, there are three steps to build the architecture. First, the initial multi-operator computation
node is transformed into a DAG of mono-operator
computation nodes (via sound rewriting rules). Then,
each computation node is decomposed with a usual
junction tree construction. It provides us with a
MCDAG, in which some clusters can finally be merged.

• Thanks to simplification rule SΣ
, the normalization conditions enable us not only to avoid useless computations, but also to improve the ar1
may indirectly weaken
chitecture structure (SΣ
some constraints on the elimination order). This
is stronger than Lazy Propagation architectures [Madsen and Jensen, 1999], which use the
first point only, during the message passing phase.
Note that with MCDAGs, once the DAG of computation nodes is built, there are no remaining
normalization conditions to be used.

VE ALGORITHM ON MCDAGs

Defining a VE algorithm on a MCDAG is simple. The
only difference with existing VE algorithms is the
multi-operator aspect for both the marginalization
and the combination operators used. As in usual
architectures, nodes send messages to their parents.
Whenever a node c has received all messages val(s)
from its children, c can compute
 its own value val(c) =

⊕c V (c)−V (pa(c)) ⊗c ψ∈Ψ(c) ψ ⊗c ⊗c s∈Sons(c) val(s)
and send it to its parents. As a result, messages go
from leaves to root, and the value computed by the
root is the maximal expected utility.

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING
ARCHITECTURES

Compared to existing architectures on influence diagrams, MCDAGs can be exponentially more efficient
by strongly decreasing the constrained induced-width
(cf Section 2.3), thanks to (1) the duplication technique, (2) the analysis of extra reordering freedoms,
and (3) the use of normalizations conditions. One can
compare these three points with existing works:
• The idea behind duplication is to use all the decompositions (independences) available in influence diagrams. An influence diagram actually expresses independences on one hand on the global
probability distribution PC | D , and on the other
hand on the global utility function. MCDAGs
separately use these two kinds of independences,
whereas a potential-based approach uses a kind
of weaker “mixed” independence relation. Using
the duplication mechanism during the MCDAG
building is better, in terms of induced-width, than
using it “on the fly” as in [Dechter, 2000].4
• Weakening constraints on the elimination order
can be linked with the usual notion of relevant information for decision variables. With MCDAGs,
4

E.g., for the quite simple influence diagram introduced
in Section 3.1.1, the algorithm in [Dechter, 2000] gives 2
as an induced-width, whereas MCDAGs give an inducedwidth 1. The reason is that MCDAGs allow to eliminate
both x1 before x2 in the subproblem corresponding to Ud,x2
and x2 before x1 in the subproblem corresponding to Ud,x1 .

Compared to existing architectures, MCDAGs actually always produce the best decomposition in terms
of constrained induced-width, as Theorem 1 shows.
Theorem 1. Let wGp (p ) be the constrained inducedwidth associated with the potential-based approach (cf
Section 2.2). Let wmcdag be the induced-width associated with the MCDAG (cf Section 3.2). Then,
wmcdag ≤ wGp (p ).
Last, the MCDAG architecture contradicts a common
belief that using division operations is necessary to
solve influence diagrams with VE algorithms.

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

The MCDAG architecture has actually been developed in a generic algebraic framework which subsumes influence diagrams. This framework, called
the Plausibility-Feasibility-Utility networks (PFUs)
framework [Pralet et al., 2006a], is a generic framework for sequential decision making with possibly uncertainties (plausibility part), asymmetries in the decision process (feasibility part), and utilities. PFUs
subsume formalisms from quantified boolean formulas
or Bayesian networks to stochastic constraint satisfaction problems, and even define new frameworks like
possibilistic influence diagrams. This subsumption is
possible because the questions raised in many existing
formalisms often reduce to a sequence of marginalizations on a combination of scoped functions. Such sequences, a particular case of which is Equation 1, can
be structured using rewriting rules as the ones previously presented, which actively exploit the algebraic
properties of the operators at stake.
Thanks to the generic nature of PFUs, extending the
previous work to a possibilistic version of influence
diagrams is trivial. If one uses the possibilistic

pessimistic expected utility [Dubois and Prade, 1995],
the optimal utility can be defined by (the probability
distributions Pi become possibility distributions, and
the utilities Ui become preference
degrees in [0, 1]):

These eliminations can be structured via a MCDAG.
The only difference in the rewriting rules is that ×
becomes max and + becomes min. The computation
nodes then look like (min, max, N ), (max, min, N ),
or (∅, max, N ), and the MCDAG clusters use
(⊕c , ⊗c ) = (min, max), (max, min), or (∅, max).

CONCLUSION

To solve influence diagrams, using potentials allows
one to reuse existing VE schemes, but may be exponentially sub-optimal. The key point is that taking
advantage of the composite nature of graphical models such as influence diagrams, and namely of the algebraic properties of the elimination and combination
operators at stake, is essential to obtain an efficient
architecture for local computations. The direct handling of several elimination and combination operators in a kind of composite architecture is the key
mechanism which allows MCDAGs to always produce
the best constrained induced-width when compared to
potential-based schemes.
The authors are currently working to obtain experimental results on MCDAGs in the context of the PFU
framework (the construction of MCDAG architectures
is currently implemented). Future directions could be
first to adapt the MCDAG architecture to the case of
Limited Memory Influence Diagrams (LIMIDs) [Lauritzen and Nilsson, 2001], and then to use the MCDAG
architecture in the context of approximate resolution.
