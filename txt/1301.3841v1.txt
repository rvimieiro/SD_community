Abstract

Monte Carlo sampling has become a major
vehicle for approximate inference in Bayesian
networks. In this paper, we investigate a fam­
ily of related simulation approaches, known
collectively as quasi-Monte Carlo methods
based on deterministic low-discrepancy se­
quences. We first outline several theoreti­
cal aspects of deterministic low-discrepancy
sequences, show three examples of such se­
quences, and then discuss practical issues re­
lated to applying them to belief updating in
Bayesian networks. We propose an algorithm
for selecting direction numbers for Sobol se­
quence. Our experimental results show that
low-discrepancy sequences (especially Sobol
sequence) significantly improve the perfor­
mance of simulation algorithms in Bayesian
networks compared to Monte Carlo sampling.

Introduction

Since exact inference in Bayesian networks is NP-hard
[Cooper, 1990], approximate inference algorithms may
for very large and complex networks be the only class
of algorithms that will produce any result at all. A
prominent subclass of approximate algorithms is the
family of schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling
(also called stochastic simulation or stochastic sam­
pling algorithms). The expected error of Monte Carlo
sampling, fairly independent of the problem dimension
(i.e., the number of variables involved), is of the order
of N-1/2, where N is the number of samples. Ran­
dom point sets generated by Monte Carlo sampling
show often clusters of points and tend to take wasteful
samples because of gaps in the sample space. This
observation led to proposing error reduction meth­
ods by means of determinate point sets, such as low­
discrepancy sequences. Low-discrepancy sequences try

to utilize more uniformly distributed points. Appli­
cation of low-discrepancy sequences to generation of
sample points for Monte Carlo sampling leads to what
is known as quasi-Monte Carlo approaches. The er­
ror bounds in quasi-Monte Carlo approaches are of
the order of (log N)d N-1, where d is the problem
dimension and N is again the number of samples gen­
erated. When the number of samples is large enough,
quasi-Monte Carlo methods are theoretically superior
to Monte Carlo sampling. Another advantage of quasi­
Monte Carlo methods is that their error bounds are
deterministic.
·

Quasi-Monte Carlo methods have been successfully ap­
plied to computer graphics, computational physics, fi­
nancial engineering, and approximate integrals (e.g.,
[Niederreiter, 1992a, Morokoff and Caflisch, 1995,
Paskov and Traub, 1995, Papageorgiou and Traub,
1997]). They have proven their advantage in low­
dimensionality problems. Even though some authors
(e.g., [Bratley et al., 1992, Morokoff and Caflisch,
1994]) believe that the quasi-Monte Carlo methods
are not suitable for problems of high-dimensionality,
tests by Paskov and Traub [1995] and Paskov [1997]
have shown that quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be
very effective for high-dimensional integral problems
arising in computational finance. Papageorgiou and
Traub [1997] have reported similarly good performance
in high-dimensional integral problems arising in com­
putational physics, demonstrating that quasi-Monte
Carlo methods can be superior to Monte Carlo sam­
pling even when the sample sizes are much smaller.
These results rise the question whether quasi-Monte
Carlo methods can improve sampling performance in
Bayesian networks. To the best of our knowledge, ap­
plication of quasi-Monte Carlo methods to Bayesian
networks has not been studied before. Of particu­
lar interest here are high-dimensionality problems, i.e.,
Bayesian networks with a large number of variables, as
these are problems that cannot be solved using exact
methods.

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS

In this paper, we investigate the advantages of ap­
plying low-discrepancy sequences to existing sam­
pling algorithms in Bayesian networks. We first out­
line several theoretical aspects of deterministic quasi­
Monte Carlo sequences, show three examples of low­
discrepancy sequences, and then discuss practical is­
sues related to applying them to belief updating in
Bayesian networks. We propose an algorithm for se­
lecting direction numbers for Sobol sequence. Our
experimental results show that low-discrepancy se­
quences (especially Sobol sequence) can lead to sig­
nificant performance improvements of simulation al­
gorithms compared to existing Monte Carlo sampling
algorithms.
In the following discussion, all random variables used
are multiple-valued, discrete variables. Bold capital
letters, such as X, A, denote sets of variables. Bold
capital letter E denotes the set of evidence variables.
Bold lower case letter e, is used to denote the observa­
tions, i.e., instantiations of the set of evidence variables
E. Indexed capital letters, such as X;, denote random
variables. Bold lower case letter a denotes a particu­
lar instantiation of a set A. Pa(X;) denotes the set of
parents of node X;. \ denotes set difference. The no­
tation for low-discrepancy sequences will be clarified
as introduced in the paper.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the concept
of discrepancy and to low-discrepancy sequences. Sec­
tion 3 presents construction methods for three pop­
ular low-discrepancy sequences - Halton, Sobol and
Faure sequences. Section 4 discusses how these low­
discrepancy sequences can be used in Bayesian net­
works. We also propose an algorithm for selection of
direction numbers for Sobol sequence. Section 5 re­
ports our empirical evaluation of quasi-Monte Carlo
methods in Bayesian networks. Finally, Section 6 dis­
cusses the implications of our findings.

Discrepancy and Low-discrepancy
Sequences

This section provides a brief introduction to the con­
cepts of discrepancy and low-discrepancy sequences as
applied in quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Our exposition
is based on that of Niederreiter [1992b].
Discrepancy is a measure of nonuniformity of a se­
quence of points placed in a unary hypercube [0, 1]d.
The most widely studied distance measure is the star
discrepancy.

In other words, for every subset E of [0, 1]d of the form
[0, v1 ) x ... x [0, vd ) , we divide the number of points
Xk in E by N and take the absolute difference between
this quotient and the volume of E. The maximum
difference is the star discrepancy D'N.
A sequence x1, x2,
, XN of points in [0, l]d is a
low-discrepancy sequence if for any N > 1
. . •

where the constant c(d) depends only on the problem
dimension d. The idea behind the low-discrepancy se­
quences is to let the fraction of the points within any
subset E of [0, 1]d of the form [ 0, vi ) x ... x [0, vd )
be as close as possible to its volume. That way, the
low-discrepancy sequences will spread over [0, 1]d as
uniformly as possible, reducing gaps and clustering of
points. Figure 1 uses two-dimensional projection of a
random sequence and of a low-discrepancy sequence to
demonstrate the fundamental difference between the
two classes of sequences.

Monte Carlo sampling, we first generate a random se­
quence of independent vectors X1, x2, . .. , xN from the
uniform distribution on [ 0, 1] d, then use 1J 2::�1 f(xi)
as the estimator of I. The error bound for Monte Carlo
sampling is probabilistic with order O(N-112). In
quasi-Monte Carlo methods, we use a low-discrepancy
sequence x1, x2, ... , XN instead of a random se­
quence to estimate I. The integration accuracy for
quasi-Monte Carlo methods relates to star discrepancy
by the Koksma-Hlawka inequality (see [Niederreiter,
1992b])

where V(f) < oo is the variation of f in the sense
of Hardy and Krause (see [Niederreiter, 1992b]). It
is easy to see that with an increase in N quasi-Monte
Carlo methods may offer better convergence rates than
Monte Carlo sampling. Another advantage of quasi­
Monte Carlo methods is that we obtain deterministic
error bounds 0((log N)d IN).

Unfortunately, the theory has it that when the prob­
lem dimension d is high, it takes much larger N
for the quasi-Monte Carlo methods to be superior
over Monte Carlo sampling. For example, in a 20dimensional problem, (log N) 20 IN is still greater than
1IN112 when N < 1075. This observation has con­
tributed to the belief that quasi-Monte Carlo methods
are not effective in high-dimensional problems [Bratley
et al., 1992, Morokoff and Caflisch, 1994]. However,
several experimental tests [Paskov and Traub, 1995,
Paskov, 1997, Papageorgiou and Traub, 1997] contra­
dicted this theoretical prediction and demonstrated
that quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be very effective
also in high-dimensional integral problems.

The basic low-discrepancy sequences proposed in the
literature are those of Halton [1960], Sobol [1967], and
Faure [1982]. Niederreiter [1992b] proposed a general
principle for constructing so-called (t, d)-sequences.
The sequences of Halton, Sobol and Faure can be
viewed as special cases of generalized (t, d)-sequences.
3

Construction of Low-Discrepancy
Sequences

In this section, we briefly describe the construction of
three low-discrepancy sequences - Halton, Sobol and
Faure sequences. General principles of generating low­
discrepancy sequences can be found in [Niederreiter,
1992b].

3.1

The Halton Sequence

Let p1, P2, . . . , P be the first d prime numbers. The
d
Halton d-dimensional sequence [Halton, 1960] is de­
fined as sequence

Xn = (�p1(n), . . . ,�Pi(n), . . . , �Pd(n)) ,

where �Pi (n) is the jth radical inverse function:

L ai(j, n)pj i
l(j)

�Pi(n) =

-

1

.

This sum is finite with the integer coefficients a i(j,n) E
[O,pi - 1] (j and n are indexes) coming from the digit
expansion of the integer n in base Pi

i=O

l(j)
n = Lai(j,n)p;, l(j) = rlogPj n
i=O

l

3.2

The Sobol Sequence

The Sobol sequence [1967] is generated from a set of
special binary fractions of length w bits, vf, i = 1, 2,
. .. , w, j = 1, 2, . . . , d. The numbers vf are called
direction numbers.

In order to generate direction numbers for dimension
j, we start with a primitive (irreducible) polynomial
over the field F2 with elements {0, 1}. Suppose the
primitive polynomial in dimension j is
q 1
Pi (x) = q + a1x - + ... + aq-1X + 1 .
x

The direction numbers in dimension j are generated
using the following q-term recurrence relation

EB (v{_ l2q),
q
q
where i > q. EB denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
The initial numbers v{ 2w, v� 2w, . . . , vt 2w can be
arbitrary odd integers smaller than 2, 22, ... , and 2q,
respectively. The Sobol sequence x� (n = L:�=O bi2i,
b i E {0, 1}) in dimension j is generated by

vf = a1v{_1 EB a2v{_2 EB .. .

EB

aq-1v{_q+1 EB v{_

·

x� = b1v{

·

·

b2v� EB ... EB bwvL .

We should use a different primitive polynomial to gen­
erate Sobol sequence in each dimension.
EB

Antonov and Saleev [1979] proposed an efficient vari­
ant of Sobol sequence based on Gray code. An imple­
mentation of this variant is described in [Bratley and
Fox, 1988].
3.3

The Faure Sequence

The Faure sequence [1982] can be generated as follows.
Let p be the first prime number such that p � d and

75

pm is the upper bound of the sample size. Let Ci j =
(j) mod p, 0 :::; j :::; i :::; m. Consider the base p

is then given by

The other coordinates are given by

Even though there exist other theoretical low­
discrepancy sequences with asymptotically good be­
havior (i.e., with small value of c(d)), such as Niederre­
iter sequence [Niederreiter, 1988] or Niederreiter-Xing
sequence [Niederreiter and Xing, 1996], we will not dis­
cuss them here. Practical usability of these sequences
requires careful testing and solving implementational
issues. It is not certain that sequences with asymptot­
ically good behavior will necessarily perform well in
practical applications, where only a finite number of
points near the beginning of the sequence are used.

Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods m
Bayesian Networks

In this section, we describe our adaptation of quasi­
Monte Carlo algorithms to belief updating in Bayesian
networks. We focus on importance sampling algo­
rithms, currently the best performing stochastic sam­
pling algorithms (see [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000]). We
start with a brief general description of sampling algo­
rithms and follow this by a description of importance
sampling. Finally we propose an algorithm for gener­
ation of direction numbers in Sobol sequence.
4.1

Stochastic Sampling in Bayesian
Networks

We know that the joint probability distribution over
all variables of a Bayesian network model, Pr(X), is
the product of the probability distributions over each
of the nodes conditional on their parents, i.e.,
Pr(X) = Pr(X;JPa(Xi)) .
i=1
n

IT

In order to calculate the probability of evidence
Pr(E = e), we need to sum over all Pr(X\E, E =e),
Pr(E =e) =

L Pr(X\E, E =e) .

(2)

The posterior probability Pr(ae
J ) can be obtained by
first computing Pr( a, e) and Pr(e) separately accord­
ing to equation (2), and then combining these two
based on the definition of conditional probability
X\E

Pr(ae
I )=

Pr(a, e)
.
Pr(e)

Stochastic sampling algorithms attempt to obtain an
estimate of Pr(E = e) in equation (2), which is anal­
ogous to approximate computation of integrals. The
number of summation terms, which we will denote by
d(X\E), corresponds to the dimension of the problem.

In order to estimate Pr(E = e), we can first gener­
ate a low-discrepancy sequence of x1, x2, ..., xN in
d(X\E) dimension unit supercube using the methods
described in Section 3. Every dimension j corresponds
to a node in X\E. Then the value x{ can be processed
as a random number generated for the corresponding
node in sample i. Using this conversion method, low­
discrepancy sequences can be easily applied to many
sampling algorithms, such as probabilistic logic sam­
pling [Henrion, 1988], likelihood weighting [Fung and
Chang, 1989, Shachter and Peat, 1989], importance
sampling [Shachter and Peat, 1989], or AIS-BN sam­
pling [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000].
4.2

Importance Sampling for Bayesian
Networks

Sampling algorithms will in general work very well
when the estimated function Pr(X\E, E =e) is
smooth. When Pr(X\E, E =e) is not smooth, the
performance of sampling algorithms will deteriorate
(i.e., their convergence rate will be very slow). This
is also true for quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Impor­
tance sampling algorithms [Shachter and Peot, 1989,
Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000] address this problem by
choosing an appropriate sampling distribution. The
main principle of importance sampling can be sum­
marized as an attempt to find an importance density
sampling function Prisf (X\E) that will let
f(X\E) =

Pr(X\E, E =e)
Prisf (X\E)

(3)

be as smooth as possible. Another requirement for
the importance sampling function Prisf (X\E) is that
it should be easy to generate samples according to that
function. If we generate samples x1, x2, ... , XN ac­
cording to the function Prisf (X\E) independently and

76

randomly, then f:t 2:�1 f( ;) is an unbiased estimator
x
of Pr(E = e). A thorough discussions of detail of im­
portance sampling in Bayesian networks can be found
in [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000).

Direction Numbers in Sobol Sequence

Suppose that we choose a primitive polynomial of de­
gree q that will generate Sobol sequence in a certain di­
mension. From the discussion in Section 3.2, we know
that the initial numbers v{ · 2w, v4 2w, .. . , vt · 2w in
Sobol sequence can be arbitrary odd integers smaller
than 2, 22,
, 2q respectively. A simple calculation
shows that there are a total of 2q·(q-l}/2 ways of choos­
ing these q integers. For dimension of 36 (in which
case q has to be 8 or higher), this number is larger
than 227. Considering all dimensions makes the total
space for the initial direction numbers huge. We have
found experimentally that the choice of these numbers
affects the convergence rate significantly. Although
Paskov and Traub [1995) and Paskov [1997) mention
that they made improvements in the initial direction
numbers for the Sobol sequence, they do not reveal the
method that they used. This section proposes an al­
gorithm for the choice of initial direction numbers for
quasi-Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian networks.

• • •

Since the idea behind the low-discrepancy sequences is
to let the points be distributed as uniformly as possi­
ble, we introduce an additional measure of uniformity
of the distribution of a set of points that will be useful
in choosing direction numbers. Essentially, to compute
this measure of uniformity, we divide the unit square
into m2 equal parts. Ideally, each part should have
Njm2 points. We calculate the sum of the absolute
differences between the actual and the ideal number
of points in each part. This measure is heuristic in
nature, as it looks at only two dimensions at a time.
We have found empirically that the direction numbers
based on this uniformity property are reasonable.

Suppose that we have obtained the initial direction
numbers for the first i dimensions and have derived
the first N points { , j = 1, 2, ... , i , l = 1, 2, ... , N,
x
based on these numbers. For the dimension i + 1, we
randomly choose the initial numbers v f+1 2w, v�+l
2w, .. . , v�+l · 2w and then calculate x;+l, l = 1, 2,
... , N. After computing the sum of the uniformity
discrepancy in the unit square given by dimensions
i + 1 and each of the i dimensions based on these N
points, we choose the initial direction numbers that
minimize the sum as our initial direction numbers in
dimension i + 1. This is essentially a random search
process. (Due to the size of the search space, it is
impossible to conduct an exhaustive search.) Figure 2
contains an algorithm describing our approach.

Figure 2: An algorithm for generating initial direction
numbers in Sobol sequence.

We know that in Bayesian networks parent nodes af­
fect their children directly. A good sampling heuristic
is to keep parent nodes close to their children in the
sampling order and to keep those dimensions that are
close together more uniformly distributed. We achieve
this by giving a higher weight w(k,i ) to those dimen­
sions that are close to each other when computing the
uniformity discrepancy. In our tests, we have chosen
N = 1, 024, m = 32 and w(k,i) = 1 when k 2': i - 8,
otherwise w(k,i) = 0.

Experimental Results

We performed empirical tests comparing Monte Carlo
sampling to quasi-Monte Carlo methods using five net­
works: COMA [Cooper, 1984), As iA [Lauritzen and
Spiegelhalter, 1988), ALARM [Beinlich et al., 1989),
HAILFINDER [Abramson et al., 1996, Edwards, 1998),
and a simplified version of the CPCS (Computer­
based Patient Case Study) network [Pradhan et al.,
1994]. The first four networks can be downloaded from
http://www2.sis.pitt.edu/....g
., enie.
The CPCS
network can be obtained from the Office of Technol­
ogy Management, University of Pittsburgh. Each of
the tested networks is multiply-connected and the last
three networks are multi-layer networks with multi­
valued nodes. In case of the CPCS network, we have
used the largest available version for which comput­
ing the exact solution is still feasible, so that we could
compute the approximation error in our experiments.
The sizes of the networks (this corresponds directly
to the dimension of the sampling space) ranged from
5 to 179. Each of these networks has been used in

UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS

the UAI literature for the purpose of demonstration
or algorithm testing. Most of them are real or realistic
with both the structure and the parameters elicited
from experts. We believe that our test set was quite
representative for practical networks.
We focused our tests on the relationship between the
number of samples and the accuracy of approximation
achieved by the simulation. We measured the latter
in terms of the Mean Square Error (MSE), i.e., square
root of the sum of square differences between Pr' (Xij)
and Pr(Xij), the sampled and the exact marginal prob­
abilities of state j (j = 1, 2, . . . , ni) of node i , such that
Xi rf. E. More precisely,
MSE=

where X is the set of all nodes, E is the set of evidence
nodes, and ni is the number of outcomes of node i .
In all diagrams, the reported MSE for Monte Carlo
sampling is averaged over 10 runs. Since quasi-Monte
Carlo methods are deterministic, we report MSE of a
single run.
We varied the number of samples from 250 to 256, 000,
staring at 250 and doubling this number at each of the
subsequent 10 steps (yielding a total of 11 sampling
steps in each test). In all figures included in this paper,
we show plots of log10MSE against log2 (N/250), where
N is the number of samples. We connect the points
in the plots by lines in order to indicate the trend.
The linear behavior observed in the log-log plots cor­
responds to a relationship MSE= eN-a., where a can
be estimated by means of linear regression. For Monte
Carlo sampling, the theoretical value of a is 0.5.
Our first tests involved belief updating without evi­
dence. In this case, we used the probabilistic logic
sampling algorithm [Henrion, 1988]. The results are
shown in Figures 3 through 7. The estimated values of
a for different networks and different sampling meth­
ods are shown in Table 1. The results of tests for low­
dimensionality problems (Figures 3 and 4) show that
the three quasi-Monte Carlo methods tested are sig­
nificantly better than Monte Carlo sampling. The dif­
ferences among the three quasi-Monte Carlo methods
are small. For a given sample size, such as 8, 000, the
smallest improvement of MSE is larger than 1,100%
(one order of magnitude). The accuracy achieved
by Monte Carlo sampling with 256, 000 samples will
be achieved by the quasi-Monte Carlo methods with
only 4, 000 sample points (two orders of magnitude
less). With the increase of the problem dimension,
the results change. The accuracy achieved by means
of Faure and Halton sequences deteriorates. For the

Monte Carlo sampling. Although the method using

when the sample size is small, its convergence rate a
(Table 1) is better than that of Monte Carlo sampling
( a = 0.5) and when the sample size is large enough,
the Halton sequence catches up. As the number of di­
mensions increases, the accuracy of the Sobol sequence
appears to be better than that of the other two quasi­
Monte Carlo methods. A remarkable result is that
the method using Sobol sequence is significantly better
than Monte Carlo sampling in all five tested networks.
In the CPCS network, for a given sample size, such
as 8, 000, the improvement of MSE is 372% (almost
an order of magnitude). The accuracy achieved using

256, 000 sample points by Monte Carlo sampling will
required about 16, 000 sample points in the method
using Sobol sequence (still over an order of magnitude
improvement). Its convergence rate a = 0.71 is also
better than that of Monte Carlo sampling ( a 0.5),
which means that higher number of samples will lead
to even larger improvement. Table 1 shows that the
convergence rate a of quasi-Monte Carlo methods was
always better than Monte Carlo sampling. It seems
that the method using Halton sequence leads to bet­
ter convergence rates than that using Faure sequence
with the increase of dimensions.

(3). In our earlier tests involving evidential reasoning
with very unlikely evidence, the AIS-BN algorithm has
consistently outperformed the likelihood weighting al­
gorithm by several orders of magnitude. As the focus
of the current paper is a comparison of Monte Carlo
sampling to quasi-Monte Carlo methods, we used the
same importance sampling for both. We run the AIS­
BN algorithm until it has found a good importance
function Prisf (X\E) and then used importance sam­
pling (Section 4.2) to compare Monte Carlo sampling
to quasi-Monte Carlo methods. We used only the
CPCS network in our tests, as it has observable nodes
indicated as such. Our test cases for evidential reason­
ing were, therefore, quite realistic. Figure 8 shows a

Our final test focused on evidential reasoning. As men­
tioned before, in evidential reasoning, when the func­
tion Pr(X\E, E = e ) is not smooth, the performance
of sampling methods will in general be poor. In or­
der to compare Monte Carlo sampling to quasi-Monte
Carlo methods, we based our tests on the adaptive
importance sampling algorithm (AIS-BN) developed
in our earlier work [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000]. The
AIS-BN algorithm first learns the optimal importance
sampling function by adjusting dynamically equation

typical plot of convergence. The plot shows that the
Sobol sequence leads to the best results, similarly to
the results of our tests without evidence. For example,
for the sample size of 8,000, the improvement of the
Sobol sequence over Monte Carlo sampling is 293%.
The accuracy achieved by 256,000 sample points in
Monte Carlo sampling would require less than 32, 000
sample points using Sobol sequence (over an order of
magnitude improvement in speed over Monte Carlo
sampling). Its convergence rate o: = 0.61 is better
than that of Monte Carlo sampling ( o: = 0.5). The
behavior of Halton and Faure sequences is almost the
same as without evidence. It is worth to point out
that the improvement using Sobol sequence depends
on the smoothness of the function f(X\E)- the more
smooth the function is, the higher the improvement.

Figure 8: Mean Square Error as a function of the num­

nodes chosen randomly among plausible medical ob­
servations (Pr(E = e) = 7.33 x 10 -20 in this particu­
lar case). The plot shows convergence after a smooth
importance function has been identified using the AIS­
BN algorithm.
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods preserve the anytime
property of sampling algorithms. All plots of our ex­
perimental results indicate that the convergence curve
of the Sobol sequence is quite smooth. It is fairly safe
to terminate the simulation at any time and still ob­
tain a reasonable result. This is different from Monte
Carlo sampling, which is sensitive to the random seed
and often shows large variance (please note that our
plots of Monte Carlo sampling performance are smooth
because they are averaged over 10 runs).
With an increase in problem dimension, one of the
threats to accuracy is a possible significant correla­
tion between different dimension in low-discrepancy
sequences. The algorithm we used to select the direc­
tion numbers for the Sobol sequence tries to decrease

this correlation. Other methods that aim at decreas­
ing this correlation and improve the low-discrepancy
sequences can be found in [Kocis and Whiten, 1997].
Although their methods are reported to reduce the er­
ror variance, we did not see significant improvement
in our tests.
Currently, there exists no general rigorous theoreti­
cal justification that would explain why quasi-Monte
Carlo methods are superior to Monte Carlo sampling
across the variety of application studied. Several rea­
sonable explanations have been proposed. Caflisch,
Morokoff and Owen [1997] suggest that quasi-Monte
Carlo methods are superior to Monte Carlo sam­
pling if the effective dimension of the integrand is
not large. Another explanation is that the error
bounds O((Iog N)d j N) in quasi-Monte Carlo meth­
ods are of the order of the upper bounds given by
the inequality which can be a very loose inequality
for a particular function. Since the inequality (1) is
very conservative and calculating V(f) is difficult, us­
ing inequality (1) to estimate the error is not prac­
tical. There are some papers (e.g., [Owen, 1995,
Kocis and Whiten, 1997]) discussing the error estima­
tion in quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
In terms of absolute computation time, we have ob­
served that generation of one Sobol and one Faure
point takes respectively about 57% and 29% less than
generation of one random sample. As a complete sam­
pling algorithm consists of other steps that are the
same for Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo algo­
rithms, the effective difference in computation time
is smaller. We would like to caution the reader that
these comparisons are implementation-dependent and
an efficient algorithms for generating low-discrepancy
sequences or random numbers can change these re­
sults.

Conclusion

Quasi-Monte Carlo methods can significantly improve
the performance of sampling algorithms in Bayesian
networks. In our tests, as the number of dimensions
increased, the sampling method using Sobol sequence
outperformed the methods using Halton and Faure
sequences. Compared to Monte Carlo sampling, the
quasi-Monte Carlo approach using Sobol sequence not
only had a better start coefficient, but also had a bet­
ter convergence rate. The exact improvement in per­
formance depends on the smoothness of the sampling
function. In sampling without evidence, we observed
as much as a 3.5-fold improvement in the Mean Square
Error. For a fixed level of the Mean Square Error,
we observed more than a 15-fold decrease in sampling
time. Given their consistently better performance over

80

Monte Carlo sampling, we expect that quasi-Monte
Carlo methods will be widely applied in Bayesian net­
work inference.
We also believe that approximate inference in Bayesian
networks is an excellent test bed for studying the prop­
erties of low-discrepancy sequences. There is a multi­
tude of test data and extending the problem dimension
is natural.
