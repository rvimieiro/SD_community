Abstract
A new approach to maximum likelihood learning of discrete graphical models
and RBM in particular is introduced. Our method, Perturb and Descend (PD) is
inspired by two ideas (I) perturb and MAP method for sampling (II) learning by
Contrastive Divergence minimization. In contrast to perturb and MAP, PD leverages training data to learn the models that do not allow efficient MAP estimation.
During the learning, to produce a sample from the current model, we start from a
training data and descend in the energy landscape of the “perturbed model”, for a
fixed number of steps, or until a local optima is reached. For RBM, this involves
linear calculations and thresholding which can be very fast. Furthermore we show
that the amount of perturbation is closely related to the temperature parameter and
it can regularize the model by producing robust features resulting in sparse hidden
layer activation.

1 Introduction
The common procedure in learning a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) is to maximize the likelihood of observed data, by updating the model parameters along the gradient of the likelihood. This
gradient step requires inference on the current model, which may be performed using deterministic
or a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure [1]. Intuitively, the gradient step attempts to
update the parameters to increase the unnormalized probability of the observation, while decreasing
the sum of unnormalized probabilities over all states –i.e., the partition function. The first part of
the update is known as positive phase and the second part is referred to as the negative phase. An
efficient alternative is Contrastive Divergence (CD) [2] training, in which the negative phase only
decreases the probability of the configurations that are in the vicinity of training data. In practice
these neighboring states are sampled by taking few steps on Markov chains that are initialized by
training data.
Recently Perturbation methods combined with efficient Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) solvers were
used to efficiently sample PGMs [3, 4, 5]. Here a basic idea from extreme value theory is used, which
states that the MAP assignments for particular perturbations of any Gibbs distribution can replace
unbiased samples from the unperturbed model [6]. In practice, however, models are not perturbed in
the ideal form and approximations are used [4]. Hazan et al. show that lower order approximations
provide an upper bound on the partition function [7]. This suggest that perturb and MAP sampling
procedure can be used in the negative phase to maximize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of
the data. However, this is feasible only if efficient MAP estimation is possible (e.g., PGMs with
submodular potentials [8]), and even so, repeated MAP estimation at each step of learning could be
prohibitively expensive.
Here we propose a new approach closely related to CD and perturb and MAP to sample the PGM
in the negative phase of learning. The basic idea is to perturb the model and starting at training

data, find lower perturbed-energy configurations. Then use these configurations as fantasy particles
in the negative phase of learning. Although this scheme may be used for arbitrary discrete PGMs
with and without hidden variables, here we consider its application to the task of training Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [9].

2 Background
2.1 Restricted Boltzmann Machine
RBM is a bipartite Markov Random Field, where the variables x = {v, h} are partitioned into
visible v = [v1 , . . . , vn ] and hidden h = [h1 , . . . , hm ] units. Because of its representation power
([10]) and relative ease of training [11], RBM is increasing used in various applications. For example
as generative model for movie ratings [12], speech [13] and topic modeling [14]. Most importantly
it is used in construction of deep neural architectures [15, 16].
RBM models the joint distribution over hidden and visible units by
P(h, v|θ) =

1 −E(h,v,θ)
e
Z(θ)

P
where Z(θ) = h,v e−E(h,v,θ) is the normalization constant (a.k.a. partition function) and E is the
energy function. Due to its bipartite form, conditioned on the visible (hidden) variables the hidden
(visible) variables in an RBM are independent of each other:

The model parameter θ = (W, a, b), consists of the matrix of n × m real valued pairwise interactions W, and local fields (a.k.a. bias terms) a and b. The marginal over visible units is

where the first and the second terms in each line correspond to positive and negative phase respectively. It is easy to calculate P(hj |v(k) , θ), required in the positive phase. The negative phase,
however, requires unconditioned samples from the current model, which may require long mixing
of the Markov chain.
Note that the same form of update appears when learning any Markov Random Field, regardless of
the form of graph and presence of hidden variables. In general the gradient update has the following
form
∇θI ℓ(θ) = ED,θ [ φI (xI ) ] − Eθ [ φI (xI ) ]

(4)

where φI (xI ) is the sufficient statistics corresponding to parameter θI . For example the sufficient
statistics for variable interactions Wi,j in an RBM is φi,j (vi , hj ) = vi hj . Note that θ in calculating
the expectation of the first term appears only if hidden variables are present.
2.2 Contrastive Divergence Training
In estimating the second term in the update of eq(4), we can sample the model with the training data
in mind. To this end, CD samples the model by initializing the Markov chain to data points and
running it for K steps. This is repeated each time we calculate the gradient. At the limit of K → ∞,
this gives unbiased samples from the current model, however using only few steps, CD performs
very well in practice [2]. For RBM this Markov chain is simply a block Gibbs sampler with visible
and hidden units are sampled alternatively using eq(1).
It is also possible to initialize the chain to the training data at the beginning of learning and during
each calculation of gradient run the chain from its previous state. This is known as persistent CD
[17] or stochastic maximum likelihood [18].
2.3 Sampling by Perturb and MAP
Assuming that it is possible to efficiently obtain the MAP assignment in an MRF, it is possible to use
perturbation methods to produce unbiased samples. These samples then may be used in the negative
phase of learning.
e
Let E(x)
= E(x) − ǫ(x) denote the perturbed energy function, where the perturbation for each
x is a sample from standard Gumbel distribution ǫ(x) ∼ γ(ε) = exp(ε − exp(−ε)). Also let
e
e denote the perturbed distribution. Then the MAP assignment arg max P(x)
e
P(x)
∝ exp(−E)
is
x
an unbiased sample from P(x). This means we can sample P(x) by repeatedly perturbing it and
finding the MAP assignment. To obtain samples from a Gumbel distribution we transform samples
from uniform distribution u ∼ U(0, 1) by ǫ ← log(− log(u)).
The following lemma clarifies the connection between Gibbs distribution and the MAP assignment
in the perturbed model.
e
Lemma 1 ([6]). Let {E(x)}x∈X and E(x) ∈ ℜ. Define the perturbed values as E(x)
= E(x) −
ǫ(x), when ǫ(x) ∼ γ(ε) ∀x ∈ X are IID samples from standard Gumbel distribution. Then

Since the domain X , of joint assignments grows exponentially with the number of variables, we
can not find thePMAP assignment efficiently. As an approximation we may use fully decomposed
noise ǫ(x) =
i ǫ(xi ) [4]. This corresponds to adding a Gumbel noise to each assignment of
unary potentials. In the case of RBM’s parametrization, this corresponds to adding the difference
of two random samples from a standard Gumbel distribution (which is basically a sample from a
logistic distribution) to biases (e.g., e
ai = ai + ǫ(vi = 1) − ǫ(vi = 0)). Alternatively a second order
approximation may perturb a combination of binary and unary potentials such that each variable is
included once (Section 3.2)

3 Perturb and Descend Learning
Feasibility of sampling using perturb and MAP depends on availability of efficient optimization
procedures. However MAP estimation is in general NP-hard [19] and only a limited class of MRFs
allow efficient energy minimization [8]. We propose an alternative to perturb and MAP that is
suitable when inference is employed within the context of learning. Since first and second order
perturbations in perturb and MAP, upper bound the partition function [7], likelihood optimization
using this method is desirable (e.g., [20]). On the other hand since the model is trained on a data-set,
we may leverage the training data in sampling the model.
Similar to CD at each step of the gradient we start from training data. In order to produce fantasy
particles of the negative phase we perturb the current model and take several steps towards lower
energy configurations. We may take enough steps to reach a local optima or stop midway.
f e
e denote the perturbed model. For RBM, each step of this block coordinate descend
Let θe = (W,
a, b)
takes the following form
f >0
v ← e
a + Wh
(6)
(k)

e+W
fT v > 0
h ← b

(7)

where starting from v = v ∈ D, h and v are repeatedly updated for K steps or until the update
above has no effect (i.e., a local optima is reached). The final configuration is then used as the
fantasy particle in the negative phase of learning.
3.1 Amount of Perturbations
To see the effect of the amount of perturbations we simply multiplied the noise ǫ by a constant β
– i.e., β > 1 means we perturbed the model with larger noise values. Going back to Lemma1, we
see that any multiplication of noise can be compensated by a change of temperature of the energy
e
function – i.e., for β = T1 , the argx max E(x)
= argx max T1 E(x) − βǫ(x) remains the same.
However here we are only changing the noise without changing the energy.
Here we provide some intuition about the potential effect of increasing perturbations. Experimental
results seem to confirm this view. For β > 0, in the negative phase of learning, we are lowering
the probability of configurations that are at a “larger distance” from the training data, compared to
training with β = 1. This can make the model more robust as it puts more effort into removing false
valleys that are distant from the training data, while less effort is made to remove (false) valleys that
are closer to the training data.
3.2 Second Order Perturbations for RBM
As discussed in Section 2.3 a first order perturbation of θ, only injects noise to local potentials:
e
ai = ai + ǫ(vi = 1) − ǫ(vi = 0) and ebi = bj + ǫ(hi = 1) − ǫ(hi = 0)

In a second order perturbation we may perturb a subset of non-overlapping pairwise potentials as
well as unary potentials over the remaining variables. In doing so it is desirable to select the pairwise
potentials with higher influence – i.e., larger |Wi,j | values. With n visible and m hidden variables,
we can use Hungarian maximum bipartite matching algorithm to find min(m, n) most influential
interactions [21].
Once influential interactions are selected, we need to perturb the corresponding 2 × 2 factors with
Gumbel noise as well as the bias terms for all the variables that are not covered. A simple calculation
shows that perturbation of the 2 × 2 potentials in RBM corresponds to perturbing Wi,j as well as ai
and bj as follows
f i,j = Wi,j + ǫ(1, 1) − ǫ(0, 1) − ǫ(1, 0) + ǫ(0, 0)
W

e
ai = ai − ǫ(0, 0) + ǫ(0, 1)
ebj = bj − ǫ(0, 0) + ǫ(1, 0)
ǫ(0, 0), ǫ(0, 1), ǫ(1, 0), ǫ(1, 1) ∼ γ(ε)
where ǫ(y, z) is basically the injected noise to the pairwise potential assignment for vi = y and
hj = z.
