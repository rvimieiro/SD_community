Abstract
Rollating walkers are popular mobility aids
used by older adults to improve balance control. There is a need to automatically recognize the activities performed by walker users
to better understand activity patterns, mobility issues and the context in which falls are
more likely to happen. We design and compare several techniques to recognize walker
related activities. A comprehensive evaluation with control subjects and walker users
from a retirement community is presented.

not only time consuming but may not be accurate due
to synchronization issues between various sensors. An
automated activity recognition system would enable
clinicians to gather statistics about the activity patterns of users, their level of mobility and the context
in which falls are more likely to occur. This will also be
useful for the development of smart walkers that can
assist users with navigation and braking while taking
into account their intended activity.
In this paper we describe a comparative analysis of activity recognition techniques based on hidden Markov
models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs)
trained by supervised and unsupervised learning for
rollating walkers instrumented with various sensors.

Introduction

Improving the quality of life of the ever increasing elderly population is one of the key concerns for health
care provision. Limitations to independent mobility
for these individuals have a significant impact on the
quality of their life. Devices such as rollating walkers
are often used to improve the independence and mobility of older adults. Our long-term goal is to improve
the utility of these devices, by enabling them to perceive their environment and actively provide assistance
to their users.
We are collaborating with a multidisciplinary group
that is studying the usage of rollating walkers. We
have access to a walker [9] that has been instrumented
with various sensors and cameras to monitor the user.
We are developing automated techniques to recognize
the activities performed by users with respect to their
walker (e.g., walking, standing, turning, etc.) based on
the non-video sensors. This problem is significant for
Kinesiologists who are studying the usage of walkers
by elderly people. Currently they have to hand label
the data by looking at video feeds of the user, which is

recognize activities performed by walker users;

Related Work

In [1], Alwan et al. describe a method that assesses basic walker-assisted gait characteristics, including heel
strikes, toe-off events, as well as stride time, double support and right and left single support phases.
These statistics are based on the measurement of
weight transfer between the user and the walker by
two load cells in the handles of the walker. A simple
thresholding approach is used to detect peaks and valleys in the load measurements, which are assumed to
be indicative of certain events in the gait cycle. This
work focuses on low level gait statistics where as we are
interested to recognize complex high level behaviours.
Hirata et al. [3] instrumented a walker with sensors
and actuators. They recognize three user states: walking, stopped and emergency (including falling). These
states are inferred based on the distance between the
user and the walker (measured by a laser range finder)
and the velocity of the walker. This work is limited
to the three states mentioned above and would not
be able to differentiate between activities that exhibit
roughly the same velocity and distance measurements
(e.g., walking, turning, going up a ramp).
A significant amount of work has been done on activity recognition in other contexts. In particular Liao et
al. [6] use a Hierarchical Markov Model to learn and
infer a user’s daily movements through an urban community. The model uses multiple levels of abstraction
in order to bridge the gap between raw GPS sensor
measurements and high level information such as a
user’s destination and mode of transportation. They
use Rao-Blackwellized particle filters for state estimation. In [5], they also recognize activities and places
from GPS traces by Hierarchical CRFs. This work assumes that the high level goals and routines of the user
as well as the map of the area are known and stable.

Experimental Setup

We have access to a walker developed by Tung et al. [9].
A picture of the walker is shown in Fig. 2. The walker
is equipped with various sensors including a 3-D accelerometer in the seat, a load-cell in each leg and a
wheel encoder, which measures the wheel’s displacement. The sensor readings vary between 0 and 216 − 1.
The data is channeled via blue-tooth to a PDA for acquisition at 50 Hz. In addition to these sensors, there
are two cameras on the walker. One is facing backwards and provides the video feed of the user’s legs.
The other is looking forwards and provides the video
feed of the environment. The video frame rate is approximately 30 frames/second. In order to collect data
for our models, we designed and conducted two exper-

iments that are described below:

Experiment 1

17 healthy young subjects (age between 19 and 53)
were asked to go through the course shown in Figure
1 twice with the walker. The behaviours exhibited by
the participants are shown in Table 1.
3.2

Experiment 2

In a second experiment, we asked 8 regular walker
users (age 84 to 97) to follow the course shown in Figure 3. This experiment was conducted at the Village
of Winston Park (retirement community in Kitchener,
Ontario) and the participants were residents of that
facility. We also asked 12 adults (age 80 to 89) who
do not live in a retirement community and are not
regular walker users to follow the same course. The
behaviours exhibited during this experiment include
those of Tables 1 and 2.
3.3

Recognizing Behaviours

Our goal is to perform behaviour recognition based
on the non-video sensors.1 Since the accelerometers,
load cells and wheel encoder only measure indirectly
the activities of the person, it is not obvious a priori
which activities can easily recognized. We formulated
the following hypotheses.

The use of video data is subject to future work.

range of strategies used by people to lift or lower the
walker.

Figure 2: Smart Walker

Transfers (sit to stand or stand to sit) are also expected
to be difficult to recognize due to a wide range of
strategies. In theory, the load of the walker should decrease as the person goes from standing to sitting and
increase for sit to stand. However, some people leave
the walker to hold other supports such as the arms of
a chair. Some people also engage the walker’s brakes
as they do a transfer while others move the walker.
Another difficult behaviour is the reaching task. It
involves behaviours such as opening a door or picking something from ground. The wheel encoder is not
useful as people’s habits of engaging the brakes during
these behaviours are variable. In reaching tasks, however, the person usually keeps one hand on the walker
while he/she uses the other hand to reach for the object. This can be captured by the load cells as there
will be more weight on one side.
In the next section, we discuss various probabilistic
models to recognize activities as accurately as possible despite the wide range of strategies for some behaviours.

Not Touching Walker (NTW) should be easy to predict as there is no load on the walker and the walker
is not moving. Standing (ST) should be differentiable
from NTW based on load cell readings as load fluctuations are expected when the person touches the walker.
Walking forward (WF) and walking backward (WB)
should be differentiable from ST based on the wheel
encoder measurements, which increase with forward
movements and decrease with backward movements.
Sitting on walker (SW) should also be easily distinguishable since the value of the load sensors is much
higher than any other behaviour.
We expect turns to be more difficult to predict. We
hypothesize that the speed of the person is lower when
he/she is turning. We also expect a higher load on the
side of the turn and some mild acceleration in the opposite direction of the turn. However this will likely
vary with each person. Similarly, going up or down
ramps and curbs are not expected to be easy to detect.
We expect to see some fluctuations in the vertical acceleration when there is an immediate change of elevation and a sustained mild acceleration corresponding
to gravity in the forward or backward direction depending on the inclination of ramps. We hypothesize
that both these behaviours will be noticeable. However, they may be difficult to distinguish from WF in
general. Furthermore, going up and down curbs may
be particularly difficult to recognize due to the wide

Activity Recognition Models

We assume that the set of all possible behaviours is
B whose cardinality is m. The behaviour at time t is
represented by the random variable Bt . The reading
on sensor k at time t is given by the random variable
Stk where k ∈ {1, . . . , n}. For notational convenience,
we denote the sequence of behaviours from time i to
j by Bi:j and the observation sequence on sensor k
k
by Si:j
. The readings on all sensors observed between
1:n
time i and j is denoted by Si:j
and the actual observed sequence is denoted by s1:n
i:j . The total length
of a sequence is T . The actual behaviour at time t is
denoted by b̂t and the predicted behaviour at time t is
b̃t . Lower case letters denote the assignment of a value
to a random variable.

4.1

Hidden Markov Model

We construct a hidden Markov model in which the behaviour is the hidden variable and the sensor readings
are the observations (Fig. 4). The parameters include
θb0 ,b ≡ Pr(Bt = b0 |Bt−1 = b) (probability that the
behaviour at time t is b0 given that the behaviour at
time t−1 is b), φs,k,b ≡ Pr(Stk = s|Bt = b) (probability
that the value measured by the k th sensor at time t is
s given that the behaviour is b) and πb ≡ Pr(B0 = b)
(probability that the initial behaviour is b).

Maximum Likelihood (ML) Learning

For supervised learning, we manually label the data
based on the video feed. We learn θb0 ,b by counting the
number of times behaviour b is followed by behaviour
b0 in the labeled data:
PT
δ (Bt =b0 &Bt−1 =b)
PT
θb0 ,b = t=1
∀b, b0 ∈ B
δ(B
=b)
t=1

t−1

Here δ(x) = 1 if x is true and 0 otherwise. However, in
some of our experiments, to avoid the bias introduced
by using a fixed course, we use a simple transition
model that reflects the fact that behaviours are τ times
more likely to persist than to change.
(
τ /m + τ − 1 if b = b0
∀b, b0 ∈ B
θb0 ,b =
1/m + τ − 1 otherwise
We can learn the prior πi from data using
PT
πb = t=1 δ (Bt = b)/T
Again, in some of our experiments, to avoid the bias
introduced by using a fixed course, we consider all behaviours to be equally likely initially. Hence
πb = 1/m ∀b ∈ B
We can model φs,k,b with a parametric density function such as a Gaussian. However, on close analysis of
the data, we found that the distribution of φs,i,j does
not follow a Gaussian. Therefore, we discretize the
sensor readings by dividing the range into D discrete
intervals. We learn φs,k,b using
PT

φs,k,b =

δ (Bt =b&Sti =s)
PT
t=1 δ(Bt =b)

t=1

∀b ∈ B, ∀s ∈ {1, . . . , D}
∀k ∈ {1, . . . , n}

ML with EM algorithm For unsupervised learning,
we use Expectation Maximization (EM) [2] to learn the
parameters. The algorithm alternates between com-

puting the expectations
E0 (b) = Pr(B0 = b|s1:n
1:t , π, θ, φ),
PT −1
0
E(b, b ) = t=1 Pr(Bt = b, Bt+1 = b0 |s1:n

P

θb0 ,b = E(b, b0 )/ P

φs,k,b = Ek (b, s)/ s E(b, s).
Prediction: Note that since the sensor readings at
any given time are conditionally independent given
1:n
the
Q behaviour at that time, therefore, Pr(st |Bt ) =
iI φst ,i,b . We use maximum a posteriori filtering to
infer the most likely behaviour
 given past observations:
b̃t = maxb∈B Pr Bt = b|s1:n
1:t . This computation can
be performed online as only past observations are used.
4.1.2

Bayesian Learning

Bayesian learning is an alternative to maximum likelihood learning. We start from a prior distribution and
update it using Bayes rule to obtain the full posterior
distribution over the variables of interest. By considering the full posterior over the parameters, we hope to
avoid the over-fitting issues, often experienced by the
EM algorithm. Unfortunately, in most cases the posterior does not have a tractable form, so we cannot sample from it directly. Consequently, we resort to sampling techniques based on simulating a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of interest.
A convenient choice of a prior distribution over
the parameters is a product of Dirichlet distributions
of the form Dir(θ1 , . . . , θk ; c1 , . . . , ck ) =
P
Q c1 c2
P
Γ(
Q ci )
θ1 θ2 . . . θkck where i θi = 1. Each DirichΓ(ci )
let is a prior for the corresponding multinomial distribution of transitions or emissions from some state.
The values ci can be understood as counts indicating
how many times a particular transition/emission has
been observed. The Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution. Therefore, if the hidden states are known, the posterior distribution of the parameters will also be a product of
Dirichlets with the counts updated by the number of
observed transitions or emissions. If the hidden states
are not known, the posterior becomes a mixture of exponentially many products of Dirichlets, each product
corresponding to one possible state path.
We use Gibbs sampling to estimate the posterior over
hidden states and parameters. We repeatedly sample
each variable from the conditional distribution given
all the other variables. It can be shown that the resulting Markov chain converges to the joint distribution of

Conditional Random Field

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are probabilistic
models for segmenting and labeling sequential data
[4]. We consider the special case of linear-chain CRFs.
A CRF specifies the distribution of a sequence of labels (B1:t ) conditioned on a sequence of observations
1:n
(S1:t
). In our experiments, the labels are the behaviour of the user, and the observations are the sensor measurements at each time. The probability of

By repeatedly sampling each hidden state according to
the distribution above, we are guaranteed to converge
to the posterior distribution Pr(B1:T |s1:n
1:T ).
Although we integrate out the parameters analytically,
we can sample efficiently from the distribution over the
parameters. For any assignment to B1:T , the conditional distribution Pr(π, θ, φ|B1:T , s1:n
1:T ) is a product
of Dirichlet distributions. Since the Gibbs sampler
provides us with a way to sample from Pr(B1:T |s1:n
1:T ),
sampling from Pr(π, θ, φ|s1:n
1:T ) can be done efficiently.
Gibbs sampling can be used both for learning and prediction. Here, we only use it for learning to simplify
the comparison to other methods.

a sequence of labeled training data, the most common approach to find the model weights is minimizing
the negative log-likelihood. Writing λ for the stacked

we chose σ 2 = 1, However, we found that scaling σ 2 by
factors up to 10 and 10−1 , does not yield big differences
in the accuracy of the resulting models. Since the objective function is convex, its unique minimum can be
found using gradient-based search. The term Z(s1:n
1:t ),
which also depends on λ, can be efficiently evaluated
using dynamic programming [8]. We use conjugate
gradients to minimize the negative log-likelihood and
stop training after 100 iterations.
To predict behaviours, we consider the speed of the
walker and the acceleration in x, y and z-direction.
Instead of using the raw data of the load sensors, we
consider the following measurements: the total load
(which is just the sum of the loads on each wheel), the
frontal plane center of pressure (which is the difference
between the loads on the left and on the right side
divided by the total load) and the sagittal plane center
of pressure (the difference between the loads on the
rear and front wheels divided by the total load).
Our state feature functions are based on thresholding:
for each pair of behaviours b, b0 and each sensor k, we
compare the actual observation to a fixed threshold
value. If the value is exceeded, we add some model
(e)
(n)
weight µbb0 k , otherwise, we add some weight µbb0 k . We
choose the threshold values manually by a visual inspection of the data. If the labels b, b0 cannot be well
discriminated by looking at the data from sensor k, the
threshold is chosen as the average value from sensor k;
later on, such “irrelevant” thresholds will be given very
low weights in the training of the model.
We use a very simple transition model to avoid a bias
towards certain transitions due to the design of the
walker course. In particular, the transition feature
function is given by g(bt−1 , bt ) = δ(bt−1 = bt ), hence
the corresponding weight ν is a scalar.

Given the model parameters and an observation sequence, the predicted behaviour sequence b̃1:T maximizes the a-posteriori probability of B1:T ,
b̃1:T

1:n
= arg max P (B1:T = b1:T | S1:T
= s1:n
1:T )
b1:T

where the maximization is over all label sequences of
length T . Note that b̃1:T can be computed efficiently
similar to the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs.

Results

We present results for the HMM and CRF for both
experiments. We use leave one out cross validation for
each round of training and prediction. Specifically, if
we want to predict the behaviour sequence for a certain participant in Experiment 2, we learn the parameters from all other participants in Experiment 2. For
Experiment 1, each person goes through the course
twice. We included one instance of the course in the
training data along with data from other participants
while testing for the same person.
Since the range of sensor readings is too large (all integers from 0 to 216 − 1), we divide the range into
20 intervals and set their length in such a way that
the same number of readings fall into each interval.
Since the participants’ weight varies, we also normalize
the load cell readings as follows: normalizedV alue =
(value − min)/(max − min).
Ground truth is established by hand labeling the data
based on the video. This process is not perfect since
the labeler can make mistakes while identifying behaviour transitions. For example, the labeler may interpret that a left turn started at time t, while the turn
may actually start some time before t, but it only becomes evident in the video at time t. Therefore, in
order to calculate our error, we introduce the concept

of window size. If the window size is x, then for the
behaviour at time t, if we find the same behaviour in
the window between time t − x and time t + x in the
predicted sequence, we count it as a correct prediction.
We vary our window size from 0 to 50 in intervals of
5. If we make a correct prediction within a window
width of 25, then we are only off by half a second.
Since older people perform behaviours at a rate that
is much slower than half a second, this may still be
considered accurate.
Tables 3 and 4 show the results in the form of confusion matrices for Experiment 2 when performing supervised learning with an HMM and a CRF. In both
cases, accelerometer measurements, speed, frontal and
sagittal center of pressure (COP) and total weight are
used as observations instead of the raw measurements
(see Sect. 4.2 for more details). Each entry at row i
and column j indicates how many times behaviour i
was confused as behaviour j, assuming a window of
size 25.
Due to a lack of space, we did not include the confusion matrices for Experiment 1 and for the unsupervised learning algorithms, however Tables 5 and 6
summarize the recognition accuracy of all the algorithms 
for each experiment. We define accuracy as
PT
t=1 δ b̂t = b̃t /T . Note that random predictions

would yield an accuracy of 1/7 = 14% in Experiment
1 and 1/13 = 7% in Experiment 2.
In some situations, identifying transitions from
some behaviour to another is what really matters. Hence, Fig. 5 shows the precision and recall of behaviour transitions (in addition to recognition accuracy) as a function of the window size.
We calculate the number 
of actual transitions (i.e.,
PT
AT =
t=1 δ b̂t 6= b̂t−1 ), the number of pre
P|T | 
dicted transitions (i.e., P T =
t=1 δ b̃t 6= b̃t−1 )

Discussion

In this section, we analyze the results presented in the
previous section.
Experiment 1 vs. Experiment 2: It is obvious
from Tables 5 and 6 that the overall accuracy is much
higher for Experiment 1. Difficult behaviours such as
TR, TL and TRS are also predicted accurately. In
fact, the accuracy for TRS is much higher than expected. One reason for the high accuracy may be that
in Experiment 1, each person executes the course twice

Figure 5: Accuracy, Precision and Recall for various algorithms in each experiment.
and one instance of the course execution is included in
the training data while testing for the same person.
Therefore, the training data may include information
that is more specific to the particular person e.g., how
people put load on the walker for different behaviours.
Secondly, for Experiment 1, behaviours such as NTW,
ST, WF and WB are easily distinguishable from each
other. Confusion is only likely between WF, TL and
TR and between ST and TRS. There is a larger number of behaviours in Experiment 2 that are difficult to
distinguish from each other based on sensor information e.g. WF, TL, TR, GUR, GDR, GUC and GDC.
Similarly it is difficult to distinguish between RT and
ST.
Center of Pressure (COP) vs. Normalized Load
Values: In addition to the accelerometer values and
the walker speed, we considered two alternative sets of
features for prediction. One set includes the normalized load cell measurements while the other includes
the frontal plane COP, the sagittal plane COP and the
total load on the walker. It is evident from Tables 5
and 6 that both sets of features predict different behaviours well. When the COP features are used, we
note that the prediction accuracy is lower for TR, TL,
GUR, GDR, GUC and GDC and higher for the other
behaviours.
CRF vs. HMM: Tables 5 and 6 show that the
total accuracy of the CRF is much higher than
that of the HMM. This is largely due to the fact
that the CRF models Pr(Behaviours|Observations)
directly and optimizes the parameters of this
distribution.
On the other hand, the HMM
models Pr(Observations|Behaviours) as well as
Pr(Behaviours), and then uses Bayes rule to calculate

Pr(Behaviours|Observations). Therefore, the HMM
model is more complex and the number of parameters
that we have to learn is larger. Also, the HMM makes
an explicit assumption about the conditional independence of sensor measurements over time. The CRF
avoids this (problematic) assumption since it does not
model any distribution over the observations. However, techniques for unsupervised learning are better
established for HMMs than CRFs. This becomes an
important advantage since we do not need to label data
in unsupervised learning.
We were surprised to see that the HMM was able to
predict certain behaviours better than the CRF. In
general, the HMM seems to favor behaviours that occur infrequently. For example, in Table 3, we can
see that the prediction accuracy of GUR and GUC
is higher than that of WF. We expected that it would
be difficult to accurately predict infrequent behaviours
such as GUR and GUC. Note also that WF is often
predicted as GUR and GUC. We suspect that this is
due to the assumption of conditional independence between different sensors.
Learning Transition Model from Data: As discussed in Sect. 3, the experiments include a pre-defined
walking course that biases the behaviour transitions.
This is why we considered two scenarios when learning an HMM: i) fixed transition model where each behaviour is τ times more likely to persist than to transition to some other behaviour with uniform probability
(denoted by LOD in Tables 5 and 6) and ii) learned
transition model (denoted by LOTD). Naturally, the
accuracy is higher when the transition model is learned
from data. In future work, we plan to collect data
with participants in their daily activities instead of a

scripted walking course, which will allow us to learn
realistic and personalized transition models.
ML vs. Bayesian Learning: As explained previously, manually labeling the data is a time consuming and error-prone. Unsupervised learning algorithms
avoid this problem. However, they take longer to converge and the solutions are usually approximations to
the optimal parameters. It is interesting to note from
Table 5 that for Experiment 1, the Gibbs sampling accuracy for NTW and ST is actually higher than other
algorithms. One important difficulty with unsupervised learning is state matching. On one hand, unsupervised learning algorithms may pick sub-behaviours
of composite behaviours as a state. For example, the
ramp transition can be broken up into getting on the
ramp (corresponding to a blip in the vertical acceleration), and walking on the ramp. The algorithm
may find a state that matches either one or both instead of the behaviours going up/down ramp. On the
other hand, if two behaviours are similar, the algorithm might treat them as the same state. We observe
that in Table 5, TRS is almost never predicted correctly. This may be due to the fact that TRS is very
similar to ST and hence they are merged into one state.
For EM and Gibbs sampling, once a model is learned,
we manually associate each latent state with the behaviour that is the most frequent. In general we used
a number of latent states equal to the number of behaviours, except for Gibbs sampling in Experiment 1
(Table 5) where we used more latent states (11) than
behaviours (7). As a result, the accuracy improved.
In future work, we would like to investigate more thoroughly whether using a larger number of latent states
generally improves the accuracy.
Since EM often gets stuck in local optima, we did 20
random restarts and showed the results of the model
with the highest likelihood. In contrast, Gibbs sampling does not suffer from this problem. It is evident
from Tables 5 and 6 as well as Fig. 5 that Gibbs sampling performs better than EM.

Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented a novel and significant application of activity recognition in the context of instrumented walkers. We designed several algorithms based
on HMMs and CRFs, and tested them with real users
at the Village of Winston Park (retirement community in Kitchener, Ontario). A comprehensive analysis
of the results showed that behaviours associated with
walker usage tend to induce load, speed and acceleration patterns that are sufficient to distinguish them
with reasonable accuracy. In the future, we would like
to further improve the recognition accuracy, by using

the video data and exploring various feature extraction techniques. We are also working on improving
the battery life and memory capacity of the walker to
collect data over long periods of time. In particular,
this will allow us to loan the walker to users, record
their daily usage and learn realistic and personalized
behaviour transition models. Finally, we hope to turn
this work into a clinical tool that can be used to assess
the mobility patterns of walker users and the contexts
in which they are more likely to fall.
