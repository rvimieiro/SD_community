Abstract

IDEAL (Influence Diagram Evaluation and Analysis
in Lisp) is a software environment for creation and
evaluation of belief networks and influence diagrams.
IDEAL is primarily a research tool and provides an
implementation of many of the latest developments
in belief network and influence diagram evaluation in
a unified framework.

This paper describes IDEAL

and some lessons learned during its development.

IDEAL is written in Common Lisp. Lisp was chosen
as the implementation language since it is most suited
to exploratory programming and quick development.
In addition, the software is portable across a wide
variety of platforms.
IDEAL is a library of Lisp functions that pro­
vides the following features:
•

Data structures for representing influence dia­

3.1

Facilities in I DEAL
Data structures

IDEAL provides abstract data structures for rep­
resenting influence diagrams and belief networks.
These data structures and a tool kit of associated
functions provide all the basic low level functionali­
ties required for the creation of belief networks and
influence diagrams. This includes creation of directed
acyclic graph topologies, creation of probability ma­
trices and other matrices and vectors that are indexed
and sized by the states of the nodes in the graph, ac­
cessing these matrices and vectors, manipulation of
the graph topology, control constructs that allow easy
traversal of these node matrices, etc. These are low
level features that can be used by programmers to
develop functionalities that are not available directly
in IDEAL. A user who does not need any additional
functionalities can interact with IDEAL with higher
level functions described below.
3.2

Creating and Editing diagrams

The functions used to create and edit diagrams are
at a higher level than the functions that manipulate
the low level data structures. These functions expect
fully specified diagrams as input and return consis­
tent diagrams after they are done. Some of these
functions require interactive input from the user.
Functions to do the following are available: Cre­
ation of complete diagrams, adding arcs, deleting
arcs, adding nodes, deleting nodes, adding states to
a node, deleting states from a node and editing node
distributions. These functions make suitable assump­
tions that guarantee consistency of the diagram after
they are done. For example, adding an arc between
two nodes extends the distribution of the child node.
This extension of the distribution is done such that
the child node is independent of the new parent, i.e,
the child node has the same distribution given its
predecessors regardless of the state of the new node.
Most of these functions can be used embedded in
code to create diagrams on the fly. These functions
provide the right hooks into IDEAL for a user who is
interested primarily in the existing functionality and
does not need to go into the low level implementation
details.
3.3

Copying and Saving Diagrams

The copy function in IDEAL makes a complete copy
of a fully specified diagram. This is frequently useful
when one wants to make some transformation that
might destructively modify the diagram. The copy-

ing mechanism provides a means of keeping an un­
modified original in the Lisp environment.
IDEAL also has functions that allow the user to
save a diagram to file and to reload diagrams from
these saved files. IDEAL saves the diagram in text
files and so they can easily be exchanged between
users at remote sites or on different platforms by elec­
tronic mail or other means. The saving function can
be made to recognize any extensions that the user
may make to the abstract diagram data structures.
Thus, any custom information that a user may want
to associate with the diagram can also be saved and
retrieved.
3.4

Utility functions

IDEAL provides a wide variety of utility functions
that are of use in conjunction with belief networks
and influence diagrams. Consistency checking func­
tions for the following are available: To check whether
a diagram is consistent (i.e., it is acyclic, the proba­
bility distributions sum to 1, etc), to check whether
a diagram is acyclic (a lower level function), to check
whether a diagram has a strictly positive distribution
and to check whether a diagram is a belief network.
User interface utilities are available for display­
ing a description of the diagram in text format, for
easily accessing nodes in the diagram and for describ­
ing the contents of particular nodes of a diagram.
A set of utility functions is available for creat­
ing 'random' belief networks. This set of functions is
useful for creating examples for testing of belief net­
work algorithms and for quickly creating test belief
networks that satisfy certain user defined criteria (for
example, see [1]).
In addition to these there are miscellaneous util­
ity functions. Some examples: a function for sort­
ing the nodes in the diagram by graph order and
a function that modifies the distributions of a non­
strictly positive diagram slightly (as specified by an
argument) to make the distribution strictly positive.
3.5

Diagram transformations

This is a set of functions, each of which take a con­
sistent diagram as input and return a consistent di­
agram. These transformations are used in reduction
style algorithms [14,13]. They can also be used to
make changes in diagrams or to preprocess them be­
fore passing them to an inference scheme.
Some of the transformation functions are: Re­
moval of a particular barren node from a diagram,
Removal of all barren nodes from a diagram, absorb­
ing a chance node in a diagram, reversing an arc,

reducing a deterministic node etc. The transforma­
tion functions (as implemented) change the input di­
agram destructively to yield the result. Details of
these transformations can be found in [9,14].
3.6

Graphic Interface and documen­
tation

As mentioned before, IDEAL is designed to be a
portable tool and so it does not include any imple­
mentation specific graphics features. On the other
hand, hooks are available for in IDEAL for easily lay­
ering a graphics interface over it.
Such an interface has been developed for IDEAL
on Symbolics machines. In addition to standard
graphic manipulation commands this interface pro­
vides most of the functionalities described above ei­
ther through mouse driven graph manipulation (for
eg, reversing an arc) or through convenient menu
driven commands. The interface allows convenient
access to the Lisp environment in a separate window
and can be a very effective programming tool when
developing applications based on IDEAL .IDEAL and
the Symbolics interface to IDEAL are documented in
detail in [17].

same for all algorithms of the latter three classes. So,
if need be, the actual algorithm used can be a deci­

sion that is transparent to the end user or any calling
function which needs an inference mechanism whose
details are irrelevant.
4.1

Reduction algorithms

Influence diagram evaluation algorithms as described
by Shachter [14] and Rege and Agogino [13] are avail­
able. Inference algorithms applicable to both influ­
ence diagrams and belief networks are also available
as described in the same sources.
These algorithms operate by making a series of
transformations (see above) to the input diagram.
The input diagram is destructively modified.
4.2

Message passing algorithms

Message passing algorithms model each node as a pro­
cessor that communicate by means of messages. A
distributed algorithm from Pearl that applies to poly­
trees [10] is implemented in IDEAL. This implemen­
tation also utilizes work by Peat and Shachter [11). A
conditioning algorithm that works for all belief net­
works is also available. The conditioning algorithm
calculates cutset weights as described by Suermondt
and Cooper [18]. A variation of the conditioning a.l­

belief networks with strictly positive distributions.
4.5

Estimator functions

IDEAL provides run time estimator functions for
some of the algorithms implemented in it. Given an
algorithm and a particular belief network with a par­
ticular state of evidence, the estimator function gives
a quick estimate of the complexity of the update pro­
cess.
In general, belief net inference algorithms con­
sist of two kinds of operations. The first kind are
graph operations that are polynomial in the number
of nodes in the graph (eg, triangulating a graph for
clustering, conversion of a multiply connected net­
work into a singly connected network by instanti.
atmg a cutset) 1 . The other class of operations are
the actual numerical calculations that are carried out
over the probability and potential matrices associ­
ated with the graphs. We will refer to this as the
update process. The overall exponential complexity
algorithm derives from the fact that these matrix op­
erations carried out during the update process take
exponential time. The estimator functions in IDEAL
give a quick estimate of the complexity of these ma­
trix operations.
The complexity count that is returned is a count
of the number of steps the algorithm will spend in
spanning the state spaces of the nodes or cliques in­
volved. For example, if a binary node A has a lone
binary node B as a predecessor then the complexity
count of setting the probability distribution of A is
four since one has to cover a state space of 2 x 2 states.
The complexity of normalizing the belief vector of A
is again 4 since one has to cover the state space of
the node A twice, once for summing the beliefs and
once for normalizing them.
An estimator function for a particular algorithm
takes an inference problem as input, i.e, a belief net­
work and associated evidence. The estimator per­
forms the polynomial time graph manipulations that
are necessary for initialization before the actual up­
date process can begin. It then applies embedded
knowledge of the update process to give an exact
count of the number of steps that the update pro­
cess will take. A step is defined as explained in the
previous paragraph. This estimate is made in linear
time. So overall, the estimator function runs in time
polynomial in the size of the input.

Discussion

IDEAL has been a success from the experimental
point of view. It has been used both for in-house ap­
plications and research both within and outside Rock­
well. Some examples of the uses of IDEAL include a
decision aiding model for pilots that helps to sort the
vast flow of information that comes to the cockpit
from the sensors on the plane, a life cycle costs anal­
ysis system for Rocket engines, embedded use in a
natural language system for story understanding [2]
and an implementation of interval influence diagrams
[4].
One of the lessons we learned in the process of
implementing IDEAL was that many of the algorithm
papers do not describe the algorithms in standard al­
gorithmic style. In addition they leave many details
incompletely specified. From an engineering point of
view, it would be very useful if we had both a more
complete description of algorithms and in a more con­
ventional style. IDEAL's emphasis on code readabil­
ity and explicitness were of great help in detecting
and correcting any problems that came up.
5.1

Estimator functions

As explained in the previous section, the estimator
functions carry out the polynomial time graph ma­
nipulations that precede the update process and then
give an estimate of the complexity of the update pro­
cess. The results of the graph manipulation are re­
quired to make the estimate. The actual estimate is
the result of applying a formula to the results of the
graph manipulation. These formulae were derived by
analysis of the update process of each algorithm. The
estimator functions in IDEAL apply only to exact al­
gorithms (as opposed to approximation algorithms).

In the second conditioning implementation

[11]

no conditional probabilities are calculated during the
propagation phase and so no divide by zero errors are
possible. However, it is possible that when marginal­
izing the belief vectors of the nodes after the propa­
gation, the marginals are zero. This implies that the
evidence that has been propagated is impossible (see
previous subsection).

IDEAL detects this situation

explicitly in both conditioning implementations.

We foresee more work on developing efficient estima­
tor functions.

Each estimator function may be ex­

panded into a class of functions where one may trade
off the accuracy of the estimate with the time re­
quired to make the estimate. It may be p ossible to
use these estimator functions to help choose between
competing algorithms for a given problem or to use
them as a search function to search through a space

any promising new methods that come up (for exam­

best possible method for the applications we have in

Clustering Algorithms

IDEAL supports two clustering algorithm implemen­
tations. The first implementation creates a join tree
of cliques and calculates the conditional probabili­
Consider a clique A with a

ror when P(B = b) is 0 and we try and calculate
P( A/ B = b). When creating the join tree we assign
P(A = afB = b) = 0 (we could assign anything, in
fact) for all states a of A when P(B =b)= 0. After
