Abstract
We consider the problem of approximate belief-state
monitoring using particle filtering for the purposes
of implementing a policy for a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP). While particle fil­
tering has become a widely used tool in AI for monitor­
ing dynamical systems, rather scant attention has been
paid to their use in the context of decision making. As­
suming the existence of a value function, we derive er­
ror bounds on decision quality associated with filtering
using importance sampling. We also describe an adap­
tive procedure that can be used to dynamically deter­
mine the number of samples required to meet specific
error bounds. Empirical evidence is offered supporting
this technique as a profitable means of directing sam­
pling effort where it is needed to distinguish policies.

Introduction

Considerable attention has been devoted to partially observ­
able Markov decision processes (POMDPs) [19] as a model
for decision-theoretic planning. Their generality allows one
to seamlessly model sensor and action uncertainty, uncer­
tainty in the state of knowledge, and multiple objectives
[ 1, 4]. Despite their attractiveness as a conceptual model,
POMDPs are intractable and have found practical applica­
bility in only limited special cases.

The predominant approach to the solution of POMDPs in­

volves generating an optimal or approximate value func­
tion via dynamic programming: this value function maps

are considerably more pressing.1
One important family of approximate belief state monitor­

ing methods is the particle filtering or sequential Monte
Carlo approach [6, 13]. A belief state is represented by a
random sample of system states, drawn from the true state
distribution . This set of particles is propagated through the

system dynamics and observation models to reflect the sys­
tem evolution. Such methods have proven quite effective,
and have been applied in many areas of AI such as vision

[11] and robotics [21].
While playing a large role in AI, the application of particle
filters to decision processes has been limited. While Thrun

[20] and McAllester and Singh [14] have considered the use
of sampling methods to solve POMDPs, we are unaware
of studies using particle filters in the implementation of a
POMDP policy. In this paper we examine just this, focus­
ing on the use of fairly standard importance sampling tech­
niques. Assuming a POMDP has been solved (i.e., a value
function constructed), we derive bounds on the error in de­
cision quality associated with particle filtering with a given

number of samples. These bounds can be used a priori to
determine an appropriate sample size, as well as forming

the basis of a post hoc error analysis. We also devise an
adaptive scheme for dynamic determination of sample size

based on the probability of making an (approximately) op­
timal action choice given the current set of samples at any

stage of the process. We note that similar notions have been
applied to the problem of influence diagram evaluation by
Ortiz and Kaelbling [15] with good results-our approach
draws much from this work, though with an emphasis on
the sequential nature of the decision problem.
A key motivation for taking a value-directed approach to
sampling lies in the fact that monitoring is an online pro­

mal expected value, and implicitly into an optimal choice
of action. Constructing such value functions is computa­
tionally intractable and much effort has been devoted to de­

cess that must be effected quickly. One might argue that
if the state space of a POMDP is large enough to require

veloping approximation methods or algorithms that exploit
specific problem structure. Potentially more troublesome is

sampling for monitoring, then its state space is too large to
hope to solve the POMDP. To counter this claim, we note

the problem of

first that recent algorithms [2, 9] based on factored repre­
sentations, such as dynamic Bayes nets (DBNs), can of­
ten solve POMDPs without explicit state space enumeration
and produce reasonably compact value function representa­

lief state over time as actions and observations occur so that

the optimal action choice can be made. This too is gen­
erally intractable, since a distribution must be maintained
over the set of system states, which has size exponential in
the number of system variables. While value function con­
struction is an offline problem, belief state monitoring must
be effected in real time, hence its computational demands

traditional "fiat" fashion, we typically have the luxury of
compiling a value function offiine. Thus, even for large
POMOPs, we might reasonably expect to have value func·

POMDPs and Belief State Monitoring

2.1

Solving POMDPs

A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)

is a general model for decision making under uncertainty.
Formally, we require the following components: a finite
state space S; a finite action space A; a finite observation

space Z; a transition function T

:

an

observation function 0 : S x A -+ l!.(Z); and a reward
function
: S -t R. Intuitively, the transition function

T(s, a )

R

determines a distribution over next states when an
agent takes action a in states. This captures uncertainty in
action effects. The observation function reflects the fact that

an agent cannot generally determine the true system state

with certainty (e.g., due to sensor noise). Finally
notes the immediate reward associated with s.

R(s)

de­

The rewards obtained over time by an agent adopting a spe­
cific course of action can be viewed as random variables

R(t). Our aim is to construct apolicy that maximizes the ex­
E(L�o pt R(t))

pected sum of discounted rewards
(where
(J is a discount factor less than one). It is well-known that
an optimal course of action can be determined by consid·
ering the fully observable belief state MDP, where belief

ciple, dynamic progranuning algorithms for MDPs can be
used to solve this problem. A key result of Sondik [ 19]
showed that the value function V for a finite-horizon prob·
!em is piecewise-linear and convex and can be represented
as a finite collection of a-vectors.3 Specifically, one can

generate a collection N of a-vectors, each of dimension lSI,

V(b)

such that

tion of a-vectors with the upper surface corresponding to

3

For infinite-horizon problems, a finite collection may not al­
ways be sufficient, but will generally offer a good approximation.

a plan of this form denotes the performance of action a fol­
lowed by execution of the remaining plan rr; in response
to observation oi. We denote by A(a) the (first) action
a of 1r(a). Given belief state b, the agent should execute

the action with the maximizing a-vector: A(ma(b)). In­
deed, if one has access to the entire plan 'IT(ma(b)) , this plan
should be executed to termination. We note, however, that
the plans 'IT (cr ) are rarely recorded explicitly.

One difficulty with these classical approaches is the fact
that the a-vectors may be difficult to manipulate. A sys­

tem characterized by

n

random variables has a state space

size that is exponential in

Thus manipulating a single

n.

a-vector may be intractable for complex systems.4 Fortu­

nately, it is often the case that an MOP or POMDP can be

specified very compactly by exploiting structure (such as
conditional independence among variables) in the system
dynamics and reward function

[I].

Representations such as

dynamic Bayes nets (DBNs) can be used, and schemes have
been proposed whereby the a-vectors are computed directly
in a factored form by exploiting this representation.
Boutilier and Poole

[2],

for example, represent a-vectors

as decision trees in implementing Monahan's algorithm.
Hansen and Feng [9] use algebraic decision diagrams
(ADDs) as their representation in their version of incre­
mental pruning. The empirical results in

[9]

suggest that

such methods can make reasonably sized problems solv­
able. Furthermore, factored representations will likely fa­
cilitate good approximation schemes.

2.2

Belief State Monitoring

Given a value function represented using a collection N
of a-vectors, implementation of an optimal policy requires
that one maintain a belief state over time in order to ap­

ply it to N. Given belief state bt at timet, we determine
at = A(ma(bt)), execute at, make a subsequent obser­
vation ot·f.l , then update our belief state to obtain bt+l.
The process is then repeated. Belief state monitoring is ef­
t
fected by computing bt+l = Pr(SW, a , ot+l , which in­
volves straightforward Bayesian updating. We denote by

The number of a-vectors can grow exponentially in the worst
case, but can often be approximated.

UAI 2001

Even if the value function can be constructed in a com­
pact way, the monitoring problem itself is not generally
tractable, since each belief state is a vector of size IS 1. Un­
fortunately, even using DBNs does not alleviate the diffi­
culty, since correlations tend to "bleed through" the DBN,
rendering most (if not all) variables dependent after a time
[3]. Thus compact representation of the exact belief state
is typically impossible. Belief state approximation is there­
fore often required. At any point in time we have an ap­
proximation (;t of the true belief state bt, and must make our
decisions based on this approximate belief state. While sev­
eral methods for belief state approximation can be used (in­
cluding projection, aggregation, and variational methods),
and important class of techniques for dynamic problems is
sampling or simulation methods.

Particle Filtering for POMDPs

In this section we examine the impact of particle filtering
on decision quality in POMDPs. We first describe a typical
sequential importance sampling algorithm, and discuss the
use of partial evidence integration (EI) in the DBN to help
keep samples on track. We then analyze the error induced
by one stage of belief state approximation and show how
partial EI allows this analysis to be carried through multiple
stages (in a way that is not possible otherwise).

Basic Filtering Method for POMDPs

Assume we have been provided with the value function for
a specific POMDP M. This value function is represented
by a finite collection� of a-vectors. We assume an infinite­
horizon model so that we have a single set �. We also
assume that N is of a manageable size, and that the vec­
tors themselves are represented compactly (using ADDs,
decision trees, linear combinations of basis functions, or
some other representation). We emphasize, however, that
even if the value function is represented in standard state
form, approximate monitoring is often needed. We note that
our methods can be applied to approximate value functions,
though our analysis assumes an exact set�Implementation of the policy induced by this value function
requires that a belief state bt be maintained over all times
t. At any point in time we assume an approximation bt of
the true belief state bt, and make our decisions based on this
approximate belief state.
The basic procedure we consider is the use of a particle filter
for monitoring, with the approximate belief states so gener­
ated used for action selection in the POMDP. At any timet,
we have a collection bt ofnt weighted particles, or system
states, approximating the true distribution bt. Each particle
is a pair (s(i), w(;)). We often simply write s(;) to refer to

the it 11 particle ( i � nt). The total weight of the particle
set bt is wt ::: L: w(i)· The particle set b1 represents the
following distribution (which we also refer to as bt):

_
L:{w(i): s(i)::: s}

place in the POMDP as if b1 were the true distribution.
Thus, we let at = A(ma(b1)), execute action a1, and make
observation ot+l. Our new approximate belief state t;t+l
is generated by repeating the following steps until nt+I is
greater than some desired threshold:
1.

Draw a state s1 from the distribution b1•

a state s1+1 from the distribution
Pr(st+1ls1, a1).
3. Compute w::: Pr(o1+11st, at, st+l)
4. Add sample {s(i)\ w(i)1) ::: {st+l w) to bt+l and add
w to total weight w1•
2. Draw

This sequential importance sampling procedure induces a
consistent, though biased, estimate t;t+l of bt+1, and will
converge to the true distribution according to the usual con­
vergence results. The significance of this method lies in the
fact that, for a great many systems, it is easy to sample suc­
cessor states according to the system dynamics (i.e., sample
from the conditional distribution in Step 2), and to evaluate
the observation probabilities for given states (i.e., compute
the weights in Step 3). In contrast, direct computation of
Pr(S1+llb1, at, o1+1) is generally intractable.
3.2

Evidence Integration

One difficulty with the filtering algorithm above is that the
samples generated at time t + 1 are not influenced by ob­
servation o1+1, which often allows particles to drift from
the true belief state. Since we assume a DBN representa­
tion of dynamics, partial evidence integration (El) or arc
reversal [8] can be used to partially alleviate this problem
[13]. The generic structure of a DBN (assuming a fixed ac­
tion) is shown in Figure 2(a); reversing the arc from St+l to
ot+I results in a network shown in Figure 2(b). With this
structure, given a particle s( and observation ot+l, a par-

q

ticles(� 1 can be drawn directly. Of course, the reweighting

given ot+l must now be applied to the particles in b1. This
gives rise to the following particle fli tering procedure used
throughout the remainder of the paper:

Theorem

Multi-stage Analysis

The analysis above assumes that once an a-vector is cho­
sen, the plan corresponding to that vector will be imple­
mented over the problem's horizon. In fact, once the first
action A (a) is taken, the next action will be dictated by re­
peating the procedure on the subsequent approximate belief
state. Due to further sampling error, the next action cho­
sen may not be the "correct" continuation of the plan rr( a).
Thus we have no assurances that the 2£-optimal policy will
be implemented with high probability. In what follows, we
assume that our sample size and approximate belief state ll
are such that T = 0 at every point in time (i.e., our approx­
imate beliefs always give at least 2£-separation for the op­
timal vector). We discuss this assumption further below.
We make some preliminary observations and definitions be­
fore analyzing the accumulated error.
•

457

We first note that b1+ 1 is an unbiased estimate of the
distribution T(bt, at, o�+1). Though particle filtering
does not ensure that b1+1 is unbiased with respect to
the true belief state b1+ 1, our evidence integration pro­
cedure and reweighting scheme produce "locally" un­
biased estimates. To see this, notice that the distribu­
tion// obtained by reweighting b1 w.r.t. o1+1 corre­
sponds to exact inference assuming the distribution b1
is correct for St. (This exact computation is tractable
precisely because of the sparse nature of this approxi­
mate "prior" on 51.) Thus, the procedure for generat­
ing samples of st+l using b1 is a simple forward prop­
agation without reweighting, and thus provides an un­
biased sample of T (bt, at, o1+1 ) .
Let us say that a mistake is made at stage t if ma(b1+1)
is not optimal w.r.t. T(b1, a1, o1+1 ) . In other words,
due to sampling error, the approximate belief state
i/+1 differed from the "true" belief state one would
have generated using exact inference w.r.t. b1 in such
a way as to preclude an optimal policy choice.

We can now analyze the error in decision quality associated
with acting under the assumption that T = 0. Let stage t
be the first stage at which a mistake is made. If this is the
case, we have that ma ( b"+ 1 ) = ma (T ( b" , a", o"+1)) for
all k < t. By Fact I , this means that ma(b") = ma(b")
for all k < t (where b" is the true stage k belief state one
would obtain by exact monitoring). Thus, if stage t is the
first stage at which a mistake is made, we have acted ex­
actly as we would have using exact monitoring for the first t
stages of the process. Since our sampling process produces
an unbiased estimate b"+1 ofT(b", a", a"+1) at each stage,

The above reasoning assumes that T reaches zero at each
stage of the process, a fact which cannot be assumed a pri­
ori, since it depends crucially on the particular (approxi­
mate) belief states that emerge during the monitoring of the
process. Unfortunately, strong a priori bounds, as a simple
function of£ and J, are not possible if T > 0 at more than
one stage. The main reason for this is that the conditional
plans that one executes generally do not correspond to a­
vectors that make up the optimal value function. Specifi­
cally, when one chooses aT-optimal vector (for some 0 <
T $ 2e) at a specific stage, a (worst-case) error ofT is intro­
duced should this be the only stage at which a suboptimal
vector is chosen. If a T-optimal vector is chosen at some
later stage (T > 0), the corresponding policy is r-optimal
with respect to a vector that is itself only approximately op­
timal. Unfortunately, after this second "switch" to a subop­
timal vector, the error with respect to the original optimal
vector cannot be (usefully) bounded using the information
at hand.5
However, even without these a priori guarantees on deci­
sion quality, we expect that in practice, the following ap­
proximate error bound will work quite well, specifically as
a guide to determining appropriate sample complexity, as
discussed below:

(4)

Intuitively, at each stage of the process a 2e:-optimal vec­
tor will be chosen with high probability. Though we cannot
ensure this, in practice we expect that the cumulative error
over those stages where mistakes are not made can be use­
fully estimated by the first term. The second term accounts
for the possibility of mistakes, as in Theorem 4. Here a mis­
take refers to the probability 1-J event of choosing a vector
at a specific stage that is not 2£-optimal.
We also note that a post hoc analysis like that described for
one-stage analysis can be used to bound error:

ror associated with the first switch to an approximately op­
timal vector at stage t, while the third reflects the second
switch. The main weakness in the bound again lies in this
last term and its reliance on h to bound error after a second
switch. One way in which these bounds can be strengthened
is through the use of switch set analysis, a technique de­
scribed in [17]. The set of constraints imposed by the sam­
pling scheme on the true belief state are linear and a priori
error bounds can be computed by

dynamic programming.

Details are beyond the scope of this paper.

The analysis above allows us to determine a priori the sam­
ple complexity required to achieve a certain error with a
specified probability. Our objective is ultimately to be rea­
sonably sure we choose the correct (maximizing) cr-vector
at each stage of the process. The method above ensures this
by requiring that
is estimated reasonably precisely for
each cr. The post hoc analysis of value separation suggests
that great precision is not needed if the vectors are widely
separated at the true belief state, specifically, if the best vec­
tor has value much greater than the second best. Draw­
ing on ideas from the literature on group sequential meth­
ods [ 12] and multiple-comparisons with the best (MCB)
[10] that analyze decision making from this perspective,
we describe a method that at each stage generates samples
dynamically, using a sampling plan whose termination de­
pends on results at earlier stages of the plan. The method is
inherently simple: we will take samples in batches until we
can select an cr-vector satisfying certain requirements. Our
method recalls the application of MCB results and group se­
quential methods by Ortiz and Kaelbling to influence dia­
grams (see [15] for details and further references).

rameter and nt = m1 as the number of samples. Defining
r1 as above, and combining a lower bound for o:i with an
upper bound for all the others, we have

If r = r1 is nonpositive, cri is the optimal vector with prob­
ability at least 1 - o1. In general, if we stop immediately
after processing the first batch and select cri, the error in­
curred will be at most max(O, r ) :::; 2C:t = 2 max01 c01[1].

If we are unsatisfied with the precision r achieved, we gen­
erate a second batch of m2 samples, and propose that

This bound holds if we insist beforehand that we will gen­
erate the second batch; but it ignores that fact that we gen­
erate this batch only after realizing our stopping condition
was not satisfied using the first batch. This dependence on
the bound resulting from the first batch-since these bounds
are random variables, this means we do not know a priori
whether we will generate a second batch-requires that we
correct for multiple looks at the data. We do this by insist­
ing that both bounds hold jointly, conjoining the bounds ob­
tained after two batches using the Bonferroni inequality and
letting T = mi n { j IJ ::,;2 , a; a ; } Tj:

Hence, if we stop after processing at most 2 batches, then
our error in selecting cr; will be at most max ( O , r ) with
probability at least 1 - (81 + o2). Applyi ng this argument
up to k batches, we obtain

Suppose we are trying to select the maximizing cr-vector

at stage t, using belief state 'bt. The basic structure of our
dynamic approach requires that we generate samples from

T(6t, at, at+1) in batches, each of some predetermined size.

To generate the jth batch:

(a) we determine a suitable confidence parameter 8j
(b) we generate the jth batch of mj samples from

T(bt, at' ot+l)

(c) we compute estimates v� [j] for all vectors cr
based on the samples in all j batches, correspond­
ing precisions E 01 (j], and let

We now elaborate on this procedure.
We use MCB results to obtain confidence lower bounds
(or one-sided confidence intervals) on the difference in true
value between that of the vector with largest value estimate
with respect to all the samples in the batches so far and the
best of the other vectors. Suppose m1 samples are gener­
ated in the first batch. Given simultaneous confidence pa­
rametero1, we obtain the one-sided boundsc:a(j] according

The method

that we force -r to zero, the number of batches k cannot be

rameters oj such that

set 8J = of(j j + 1)) and the individual confidence pa­
rameters as Oj /llX[. If there is separation between the value
of the optimal vector and the second best, the process will
stop after a finite number of batches. Hence, we can con­
tinue the process until -r ::o: 0. However, since the error
in the individual estimates decreases only proportionally to

(

ln j /j, termination might take longer than we wish, de­
pending on the amount of separation and the vector-value
variance. This problem is exacerbated by our use of loose
ranges in the computation of the precisions e: a [j].

mj is arbitrary, but needs to be fixed in advance. This is

because for our analysis to hold, mj cannot depend on the
outcomes from the samples themselves. Although arbitrary,

in general, the setting of mi should take into consideration

a trade-off between reducing the expected total number of
samples before the method stop versus reducing the varia­
tion on the total number of samples.
In general, we expect this method to be effective when there

is sufficiently large gap between the best vector and the rest,
and/or the ranges in vector values are sufficiently small rel­
ative to the value separation and the error tolerance. By us­

ing loose upper bounds on the variances and accuracy pa­
rameters, the theoretical bounds can become very loose, and

hence do not reflect the potential gains we expect. The ver­
sion presented in this paper is very simple. Many variations

on the same idea are possible to try to bring the theoret­
ical bounds more in accordance with our belief about the

expected behavior of the method (for instance, using infor­
mation about range of differences in value between vector
pairs, allocating some samples to estimate variance, etc.),

but this is beyond the scope of this paper.

As before, unless we push the error tolerance

r

to zero at

each stage of the monitoring process, we cannot obtain tight
bounds on error after that point. However, we can assert:

Suppose beliefs are monitored according to
the dynamic procedure described above using global con­
fidence parameter o. Furthermore, suppose that r = 0 at
each stage. Then error E satisfies
Theorem 6

E<

hf3o

- 1- f3 + fJo

However, as noted above, the computational demands of

insisting that r = 0 can be severe if the belief state at
some time t is such that little separation exists between the

best vector and the second-best (that is, if

l}

lies close to a

"edge" of the value function, where two optimal a-vectors
intersect). If r s 0 at all stages up to timet, then the bound
described in Proposition 5 holds for this dynamic scheme.

Empirical Evaluation

Three test problems were used to carry out experiments test­
ing the efficacy of our sampling procedures (we refer to [ 16]

for the full specification of those problems; see also [18] for

a summary). Each of the three problems was solved using
Hansen and Feng's [9] ADD implementation of incremental
pruning (IP) to produce a set N of a-vectors using a compact

ADD representation.

In the following experiments, we report on the use of sam­

pling for approximate belief state monitoring on three test
problems. The goal of the experiments are twofold: to
evaluate (i) the impact on decision quality induced by sam­
pling techniques and (ii) the sample complexity necessary

Table 1: Statistics for the three test problems. T he maxi­
mum and average size of � are taken over a 15-stage pro­
cess.

to guarantee some level of decision quality. Note that the
experiments do not evaluate the running time of sampling
methods since that is not the focus of this paper and the ef­

ficiency gains of such methods have already been clearly

demonstrated [II, 21]. In theory, exact monitoring has time
complexity on the order ofO{ISI2) whereas sampling has a

time complexity in the order ofO(m log lSI) (m is the num­
ber of samples). T hus, a sampling strategy provides time
savings when m <

ISI2/log lSI.

The reader should also

be warned that the scope of the empirical evaluation was
limited to test problems for which a set of a-vectors cor­
responding to an optimal value function can be computed.
Hence, as shown in Table 1, lSI and INI are fairly small, and
consequently the following experiments should be consid­
ered preliminary.

The first experiment compares the expected loss incurred
by sampling methods to that of a random monitoring ap­

proach. More precisely, 5000 initial belief states are picked
uniformly at random and for each initial belief state, the op­

timal expected total reward is compared to the cumulative

rewards earned by an agent that approximately monitors its
belief state over 15 stages. The difference between the opti­

mal expected total return and the actual return is the loss due
to approximate monitoring. Table 2 shows the average loss
due to a single approximation at the first stage (assuming
exact monitoring for the remaining 14 stages), whereas Ta­

ble 3 shows the average cumulative loss due to approximate

monitoring at each of the 15 stages. When doing random

monitoring, the agent picks a belief state at random (uni­
formly) and executes the optimal action for this random be­

lief state. This random method can be viewed as a naive
strategy that any other approximation method should be

able to beat. The sampling methods implemented are basic
particle filtering (with partial evidence integration) where a

fixed number of particles (20, 40, 80 or 160) are sampled
for each approximate belief state. The column "worst" re­
ports the worst possible expected loss that can be achieved
by consistently choosing the worst actions.6 The worst ex­
pected loss is included to give some idea of the scale of po­
tential losses due to approximate monitoring.

As expected, the experiments show a gradual decrease in
average expected loss as the number of samples increases.

When compared to the random strategy (and considering
the range of values obtainable across the set of possible be­
haviors), sampling methods perform quite well. In Table 2,

This worst strategy can be computed by minimizing (in­
stead of maximizing) the expected total reward while solving the
POMDP.

the first row of each problem indicates the actual error in­
curred and the second row indicates the upper bound 2c pre­
dicted by the theory (for £ == 0 . 1 ). This bound is loose when
compared to the actual error due to the worst-case nature of
the analysis. The bounds may still provide some guidance
regarding the amount of sampling desired to reduce the av­
erage expected loss to some suitable level (assuming a more
or less constant ratio between the bounds and the actual er­
ror).
In a second experiment, we evaluate the benefits of dynam­
ically determining the amount of sampling. For given o
and (, we evaluate the total number of samples necessary to
guarantee that the one-stage sampling error is bounded by
2c with confidence 1 - o. Table 4 shows how this total num­
ber ()f samples varies as we increase the maximum number
of batches. Once again, 5000 random initial belief states
are chosen and the average number of samples required to
decrease r below 2c is reported. The column for 1 batch
corresponds to the standard non-dynamic sampling proce­
dure. Table 4 reveals that for the widget and pavement prob­
lems, a dynamic sampling procedure can reduce the sam­
pling complexity quite dramatically for a well-chosen max­
imum number of batches. Unfortunately, the dynamic ap­
proach does not appear to have offered any savings in the
coffee problem. Further investigation is necessary to assess
the optimal (maximum) number of batches in general.
In a related paper [ 1 8], Poupart and Boutilier also tackle the
belief state monitoring problem, but using a vector space
method that exploits conditional independence. The idea
is to repeatedly approximate belief states using projections
as initially proposed by Boyen and Koller [3). Projec­
tion schemes and sampling approaches differ in many as­
pects including the properties of POMDPs for which they

are most suitable. Sampling methods exploit the sparsity
of belief distribution whereas projection schemes exploit
conditional independence. Given that the coffee, widget
and pavement problems are factored POMDPs, the vector
space methods tend to perform better than sampling with
respect to decision quality. For instance, average losses
due to single-stage approximation using the max VS-search
method are respectively 0.0013, 0.0082, 0.0014 for the cof­
fee, widget and pavement problems; similarly, the average
cumulative losses over 1 5 stages are respectively 0.01 54,
0.05 19 and 0.007 1 . However, the computational overhead
associated with sampling is minimal while the overhead as­
sociated with choosing good projection schemes is nontriv­
ial. We expect the two approaches can be combined in fruit­
ful ways (as we discuss below).

Concluding Remarks

Our value-directed sampling technique can be seen as ap­
plying methods from the MCB and group sequential sam­
pling fields to the problem of particle filtering for POMDPs.
We are able to derive (worst-case) error bounds on such an
approach, and use these bounds to suggest methods to direct
sampling in such a way as to choose optimal actions rather
than (necessarily) accurately estimate their values. Our ini­
tial empirical results are encouraging, though clearly much
more substantial testing is needed, a task in which we are
currently engaged.
This research can be extended in a number of ways in a
number of very interesting ways. One important challenge
is to provide a stronger analysis of error when the precision
parameter r > 0. One strategy to circumvent this diffi­
culty builds on the idea of constructing the set of alternative
conditional plans that may be executed when r > 0 [ 1 7] .
Another challenge is to provide an analysis i n the absence
of partial EI (which locally removes bias): one idea is to
use information from the DBN parameters to compute a pri­
ori error bounds; another is to use absolute approximation
bounds similar to those used in this paper or optimal rela­
tive approximation methods to obtain a posteriori bounds
on the error tolerance r.
We are very interested in adapting these techniques to other
value function representations (e.g., grid-based value func­
tions) and providing an error analysis of this method when
the value function is itself an approximation of the true
value function. Finally, previous work using value-directed
projection schemes [3, 1 7] has been used successful ly to ex-

ploit the conditional independence present

in certain fac­

tored POMDPs to speed up belief monitoring. The sam­
pling approach described in this work does not exploit this
type of structure; however, one could sample the variables
defining the factored state space in a "stratified" fashion, or
apply Rao-Blackwellisation methods [6, 7].
