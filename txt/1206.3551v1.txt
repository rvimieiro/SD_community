Abstract
Decision circuits have been developed to perform efficient evaluation of influence diagrams [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007],
building on the advances in arithmetic circuits for belief network inference [Darwiche,
2003]. In the process of model building and
analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis to
understand how the optimal solution changes
in response to changes in the model. When
sequential decision problems under uncertainty are represented as decision circuits, we
can exploit the efficient solution process embodied in the decision circuit and the wealth
of derivative information available to compute the value of information for the uncertainties in the problem and the effects of
changes to model parameters on the value
and the optimal strategy.

INTRODUCTION

Influence diagrams are powerful communication tools
and computational aids for the analysis of practical decision problems [Howard and Matheson, 1984]. Decision circuits are a recent graphical representation that
have been introduced for the efficient evaluation of influence diagrams [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007].
In this paper, we show that they are also useful for
efficient sensitivity analysis in influence diagrams.
The phrase sensitivity analysis refers, in general, to
understanding how the output for a system varies as
a result of changes in the system’s input(s). For influence diagrams, one may be concerned about how
the optimal solution and the certain equivalent (CE)
change with respect to a change in the parameters, i.e.
the probabilities and the utilities, or a change in the
informational assumptions of the problem. There are
many questions that we can use sensitivity analysis to

answer. For example, suppose we vary one parameter
keeping all other parameters constant. For what range
of this varying parameter is the current optimal strategy still optimal? How does the value change as this
parameter is varied? What if the structure of the influence diagram changes and an uncertainty that would
not have been revealed before we make a decision is
now observed before the first decision is made? These
are only some of the queries on the model that we seek
to answer.
Several issues in sensitivity analysis of Bayesian belief
networks have been studied, using arithmetic circuits
[Darwiche, 2003] for efficient solutions [Chan and Darwiche, 2002; 2004; 2006]. Our work builds on this
body of research. Arithmetic circuits are graphical
representations that have been shown to be efficient
at performing inference on belief networks. Decision
circuits promise similar benefits in the context of sequential decision problems.
In sections 2, 3 and 4 we briefly discuss some preliminaries, and review literature on circuits and sensitivity
analysis in influence diagrams. In section 5, we introduce key ideas of performing sensitivity analysis with
decision circuits for normal form influence diagrams,
i.e. influence diagrams involving a single decision node
with no parents. We show how to perform some basic sensitivity analysis with decision circuits, such as:
plotting the certain equivalent in a one-way sensitivity
analysis, finding the range of a parameter over which
the current optimal stays optimal, and computing the
value of information of uncertainties that are not affected by decisions, using partial derivatives. This
serves as an introduction to section 6, where we present
results for influence diagrams that may contain multiple decision nodes. We show the challenges and necessary modifications from the previous section. Finally,
section 7 describes our conclusions and directions for
future work.

PRELIMINARIES

We assume that the reader is familiar with graphical
models such as Bayesian belief networks and influence
diagrams (see Shachter (2007) for an overview). Consider the two examples shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a
presents a belief network with two nodes, labelled W
(Weather) and B (Bring umbrella). We are interested
in knowing whether a friend will bring an umbrella,
and we believe that it is easier to model this if we
condition on the weather. Figure 1b shows the influence diagram for a decision problem in which our
friend chooses whether to bring an umbrella based on
her belief about the weather and her preferences, represented by the node U (Utility). She will observe
a weather Report (R) before she makes her decision.
We use these examples to demonstrate the concepts in
later sections.
We make a distinction between extensive and normal
form influence diagrams. When there is only one decision node and it has no parents, the diagram is said
to be in normal form [Savage, 1954; Raiffa, 1968]. We
extend that definition to allow for evidence, i.e. that
we observe certain variables taking on specific values.
Alternatively, when decisions are represented by separate nodes, or when the diagram has a decision node
with at least one parent, the diagram is said to be
in extensive form. There can be a large number of
strategies in an influence diagram, one for each possible combination of observed uncertainties and decision
alternatives. Although it is possible to convert any extensive form influence diagram into a normal form influence diagram, it may not be efficient to do so. The
influence diagram shown in Figure 1b is in extensive
form because the decision node B has a parent R.
In this paper we assume that the influence diagram
has a single value node, referred to as utility node
U . When making decisions, we choose the alternative that maximizes the probability that utility
variable U = 1. The parents of utility node U ,
pa(U), are called the value attributes and we assess
P (U = 1|pa(U)) = u(v(pa(U))) where u(.) is a von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility function [von Neumann
and Morgenstern, 1947] such that U = 1 is at least

as good and U = 0 is at least as bad as anything
that can happen, and v(.) characterizes the value of
the attributes in terms of a single numeraire, which
we assume is dollars. Therefore, the certain equivalent
(CE) of an uncertain V , given by u−1 (E[u(V )]), represents the certain payment that the decision-maker
finds indifferent to V . Our sensitivity results will
be expressed in terms of the certain equivalent because the utility values used for the internal computations have no intrinsic meaning. We also assume
that the utility function u(.) is strictly increasing and
continuously differentiable. The most common utility
functions are linear, u(v) = av + b, and exponential,
u(v) = −ae−v/ρ + b, where a > 0 and ρ > 0, both
of which allow us to express the value of information
exactly in closed form.
We will present some sensitivity analysis results for extensive form influence diagrams with the help of the
influence diagram shown in Figure 2. In this example, our friend will decide whether to Gather evidence
(G) and purchase a weather report. Her information
gathering decision and the report will be known to
her when she decides whether to bring her umbrella.
If our friend does not gather evidence, the report is
not informative and always states “sunny”. The conditional probability tables and the value function v(.)
are shown in the figure. We assume that the decision
maker has an exponential utility function u(.) with risk
tolerance ρ = .02. The optimal strategy is to gather
evidence and bring the umbrella when the report says
“rainy” and not to bring the umbrella when the report says “sunny”. The CE of the decision problem is
$52.5.

ARITHMETIC AND DECISION
CIRCUITS

We review basic concepts regarding arithmetic and decision circuits in this section. Throughout this paper,

variables are denoted by upper-case letters (X) and
their values by lower-case letters (x). A bold-faced
letter indicates a set of variables. If X is a variable
with parents Pa(X), then XPa(X) is called the family for variable X. The values of a binary variable X
are denoted x and x̄.
3.1

Arithmetic Circuits

Belief networks are associated with a unique multilinear function over two kinds of variables, evidence
indicators and network parameters. An evidence indicator λx is a binary (0-1) variable, with λx = 0
whenever X has been observed taking another value,
i.e. it is observed not to be x. There is an evidence indicator associated with each possible instantiation x of each network variable X. A network parameter θx|pa(X) represents a conditional probability,
θx|pa(X) = P (x|pa(X)), and there is a network parameter for each possible instantation xpa(X) of family XPa(X). Each term in the multi-linear function
corresponds to one instantiation z of all the network
variables Z, involving the product of all evidence indicators and network parameters consistent with z.
The multi-linear
P Q function for a belief network is given
as f =
z
xpa(X)∼z λx θx|pa(X) where the sum is
over every instantiation of all variables in the network and xpa(X) ∼ z represents all families consistent with z. For example, consider the belief network
of Figure 1a. Suppose that W and B are binary variables with states w and w̄, and b and b̄ respectively.
The multi-linear function for this network is: f =
λw λb θw θb|w + λw̄ λb θw̄ θb|w̄ + λw λb̄ θw θb̄|w + λw̄ λb̄ θw̄ θb̄|w̄ .
The multi-linear function is a useful construct for answering inference queries in belief networks. By setting the evidence indicators to 0 or 1, we can find the
probability of observing any set of network variables
E. For instance, if we assign evidence to be e = b̄ by
setting λb = 0 and all the other three evidence indicators as 1, the function returns P (b̄) = θw θb̄|w + θw̄ θb̄|w̄ .
In general, the evidence indicators help in summing
the appropriate entries in the joint probability distribution table for computing the probability of the evidence, P (e). Furthermore, the partial derivatives of
the multi-linear function also provide solutions to several common probabilistic inference queries. We list
two lemmas with important relationships between inference queries and the multi-linear function, as proven
in Darwiche (2003):
Lemma 1. For evidence e, we have: P (e) = f (e).
Lemma 2. For every variable X and evidence e such
∂f
(e).
that X ∈
/ E, we have: P (x, e) = ∂λ
x
Arithmetic circuits are graphical structures that efficiently represent, evaluate, and differentiate multi-

linear functions. An arithmetic circuit is a rooted,
directed acyclic graph whose leaf nodes are constants
or variables and all other nodes represent either summation or multiplication. The size of an arithmetic
circuit is the number of edges it contains.
The value of the multi-linear function is computed at
the root of the circuit by evaluating the circuit in an
upward pass, starting from the leaves and ending at the
root. The result is denoted as f (e), where f (e) = P (e)
(see Lemma 1). We can calculate partial derivatives by
differentiating the circuit through a subsequent downward pass, in which the parents are visited before the
children. The upward and downward passes are also
referred to as sweeps. For further details, please see
Darwiche (2003).
Compact arithmetic circuits have been devised for
belief networks that had previously been intractable
[Darwiche, 2002; Chavira and Darwiche, 2005]. The
circuit is compiled offline, where both the local structure (in the form of determinism and context-specific
independence) as well as the conditional independencies of the graph at the global level are exploited. Several inference queries on the network can then be processed online, through subsequent operations on the
compiled arithmetic circuit. Efficient sensitivity analysis of the belief network is possible with sweeps of the
compiled circuit.
3.2

Decision Circuits

Decision circuits are arithmetic circuits augmented
with maximization nodes. They represent the dynamic
programming function corresponding to a sequential
decision problem. The size of a decision circuit is the
number of edges it contains. Figure 3 presents a decision circuit corresponding to the influence diagram
shown in Figure 1b.
Decision circuits for influence diagrams can be constructed in the variable elimination order [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007], similar to a construction technique for arithmetic circuits [Darwiche, 2000]. The
evidence indicator λd for decision D is initialized to
0 only if the alternative d is no longer available to
the decision maker. The network parameter θd|pa(D)
for a decision D is initialized to 1 if the alternative
is conditionally available under scenario pa(D), and 0
otherwise. Once compiled, the decision circuit can be
evaluated in an upward sweep analogous to evaluation
in arithmetic circuits. Decision circuits are evaluated
with evidence e0 = e ∪ {U = 1} when e is observed.
The best outcome U = 1 is also deemed to be observed
since this is an M EU problem and therefore the goal
is to find optimal policies that maximize the probability of the best outcome given the evidence. The value

of the root node of the circuit is denoted g(e0 ). The
optimal strategy is computed on the upward sweep
at the maximization nodes, where the alternative d∗
with the highest value is chosen, breaking ties arbitrarily. The network parameter θd|u is set to 0 for all
other alternatives d. The circuit can be differentiated
in a subsequent downward sweep, by treating the maximization nodes as summation nodes. Although optimal policies are determined on the upward sweep, the
M EU and CE are calculated also using results from
the downward sweep. Specifically, from Bhattacharjya

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN
INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

The conditional probabilities in an influence diagram
can be difficult to assess due to the paucity of data,
expert judgments about key uncertainties, the decision
maker’s imprecision regarding preferences, and several
other practical reasons. As a result, it is often beneficial to inspect the change in the outputs of the decision
model based on variations in the inputs of the model.
Such issues fall under the umbrella of sensitivity analysis.
Sensitivity analysis has been an essential aspect of
decision analysis throughout the field’s development.
Sensitivity analysis aids in identifying the model’s critical elements, forming the basis for iterative refinement
of the model, and can also be used after the analysis for
defending a particular strategy to the decision maker

[Howard, 1983]. Sensitivity plots displaying the certain equivalents of different strategies can help identify the important variables. Sensitivity analysis for
decision problems can be broadly classified in terms of
whether one parameter is varied while others are kept
constant (one-way sensitivity analysis) or when multiple parameters are simultaneously varied (n-way sensitivity analysis). One-way sensitivity analysis throws
light upon the critical model variables whereas n-way
sensitivity analysis provides insights into the general
robustness of the model.
Sensitivity analysis in belief networks explores the sensitivity of inference queries such as the probability of
evidence and conditional marginal probabilities given
the evidence, to the conditional probabilities of the
network [Laskey, 1995; Castillo et al, 1997; Kjaerulff
and van der Gaag, 2000; van der Gaag and Renooij,
2001]. Sensitivity to inference queries using arithmetic
circuits has also been studied [Chan and Darwiche,
2002; 2004] as has the sensitivity of Most Probable Explanations to parameter changes [Chan and Darwiche,
2006]. Our work differs from this line of research in
that it uses decision circuits to determine sensitivity
of the optimal strategy and the certain equivalent to
parameter changes in decision problems.
To perform sensitivity analysis for decision problems,
we will vary the model output with respect to metaparameters, similar to Chan and Darwiche (2002) and
Nielsen and Jensen (2003). For a variable X, we analyze sensitivity to all parameters of the form θx|pa(X)
as linear functions of a meta-parameter τ . For example if X is a binary variable with no parents, we
can set θx = τ and θx̄ = 1 − τ . In this paper we
assume that there are K meta-parameters, denoted
τk , k = 1, ..., K, each between 0 and 1, and that these
meta-parameters are drawn explicitly in the decision
circuit, although it is also possible to allow the metaparameters to be implicit [Chan and Darwiche, 2002].
We assume that each meta-parameter is associated
with only one variable. This ensures that the root
value of the decision circuit is a piecewise-linear function of each meta-parameter. This can be extended to
cases where the model inputs are non-linear functions
of the meta-parameters, such as sensitivity to risk tolerance.

ANALYZING NORMAL FORM
INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

When there is only one decision node in an influence
diagram and it has no parents, the diagram is said
to be in normal form. We extend this definition to
allow the observation that E = e. We discuss sensitivity analysis for normal form influence diagrams in this

section.
5.1

Partial derivatives

Consider an influence diagram with a single decision
node D that has no parents. Let X be an arbitrary uncertain variable, with parents Pa (Note that D can be
a parent of X). The dynamic programming function
corresponding to this normal
P form
Q influence diagram
is given by g = maxd θd λd z x,pa(X)∼z θx|pa(X) λx
where d is an alternative for decision node D. In
normal form, each alternative represents a strategy. Let EUd be the expected utility for strategy
d. Then M EU = maxd EUd , optimal strategy d∗ =
argmaxd EUd and CE = u−1 (M EU ). We will discuss
many of the normal form sensitivity results using the
following theorem, which outlines the significance of
derivatives of g(e0 ) and g(e). These are the root values of the decision circuit evaluated at evidence e0 and
e, respectively.
Theorem 1. If evidence e0 = e ∪ {U = 1} and e are
swept through a decision circuit constructed for a normal form influence
diagram,
then for any node v:

g = d θd λd z x,pa(X)∼z θx|pa(X) λx for the downward sweep. Differentiating g with respect to θd and

only terms associated with alternative d remain in the
summation. The expected utility of alternative d is

We have used some results from the proof of part (i),

value of CEd in general.

5.2

One-way sensitivity analysis plots

In this sub-section, we show how to create a graph of
the certain equivalent for the decision problem as a
function of a particular meta-parameter when all others are kept at their reference values.
The expected utility for a particular strategy is
a multi-linear function of all the meta-parameters.
Therefore, the expected utility for a particular strategy
d is a linear function of a particular meta-parameter
τk , keeping all other meta-parameters at their reference values. We denote this linear function as EUd =
αd (τk ). We already have a point on this line from the
initial sweep used to evaluate the circuit, which we denote as (τk0 , αd0 ). We also have the slope of this line,
since it equals the partial derivative from part (i) of
Theorem 1 choosing v = τk . We denote the slope as
0
αd,k
. Plotting the decision problem’s CE with respect
to changes in τk entails applying the inverse utility
function u−1 (.) to the maximum of the lines for all
strategies. If the required resolution is , then the
number of points required between 0 and 1 for the
plot is 1/. The time complexity for preparing the
plot for all meta-parameters, once we have the lines
for expected utilities of all strategies with respect to
all meta-parameters, is O(( 1 )(K)(NS )) where K is the
number of meta-parameters and NS is the number of
strategies.
Another approach to plotting the CE against a metaparameter is the standard method of sample points,
where the decision problem is re-evaluated for every
sample point over a range. If the required resolution
is , then the time complexity of this approach for obtaining plots for all meta-parameters is O(( 1 )(K)(dc)).
5.3

Admissible intervals

Another sensitivity question in the spirit of one-way
sensitivity analysis is the following one. Suppose a
certain meta-parameter is allowed to vary, keeping all
other meta-parameters constant at their reference values. What is the range of this meta-parameter over

which the current optimal strategy remains optimal?
We call this range the admissible interval for a metaparameter. In other words, we investigate how robust
the optimal strategy is, with respect to changes in any
meta-parameter.
The admissible intervals are easy to obtain for normal
form influence diagrams, based on the ideas from the
previous subsection. Since we have the lines for the
expected utilities of all strategies with respect to all
meta-parameters, we can obtain the admissible intervals Ik for all meta-parameters simultaneously. Suppose ∆+ and ∆− are the admissible positive and negative changes to τk from its reference value τk0 such that
d∗ stays optimal. We present the following theorem,
without proof, for computing ∆+, ∆− and the intervals Ik . The proof entails finding the points at which
another strategy overtakes d∗ and recognising that τk
lies between 0 and 1. The time complexity for computing these intervals for all meta-parameters, once
we have the lines for expected utilities of all strategies
with respect to all meta-parameters, is O((K)(NS )).

interval Ik = max 0, τk0 + ∆+ , min 1, τk0 + ∆− .
Binary search is another possible approach for finding
the admissible intervals. The admissible interval for
any meta-parameter τk is a convex set due to the linearity of the expected utilities for all strategies with
respect to τk . We can therefore locate the end-points
of this interval by re-evaluating the circuit at points
chosen by binary search to check if the current optimal
strategy is still optimal. If the required resolution is
, then the number of sample points needed for the binary search is O(− ln()). Thus the time complexity of
obtaining admissible intervals for all meta-parameters
by this method is O((− ln()(K)(dc)).
5.4

Value of information

The value of information for a particular uncertainty
is a useful sensitivity analysis query in sequential decision problems, specifying the maximum that the decision maker should be willing to pay to observe the
uncertainty before making the first decision [Howard,
1966; Raiffa, 1968]. The double derivatives from part
(i) of Theorem 1 can also compute the value of information for all uncertainties that are not affected
by the decision, using part (ii) of Theorem 1 (choose
v = λx ). Here M EU P I is the maximal expected utility with perfect information on uncertain variable X.
If the decision maker’s utility function u(.) is linear or

exponential, then the value of information of the uncertain variable X is the increase in the certain equivalent u−1 (M EU P I ) − u−1 (M EU ). In general, this is
usually a good approximation for the value of information, even if the decision maker’s utility function has
a form other than linear or exponential [Raiffa, 1968].
Once we have the results from Theorem 1, computing
the value of information involves summing and maximizing the partial derivatives. If the number of variables analyzed for value of information is ]var, and
assuming that the maximum number of possibilities
for all of these variables is bounded by some constant,
then the time complexity for obtaining the value of
information for all these variables is O((NS )(]var)).

ANALYZING EXTENSIVE FORM
INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

Sensitivity analysis in normal form influence diagrams
is relatively easy to describe because we explicitly represent all the strategies. Here we discuss techniques
for analyzing extensive form influence diagrams. All
of these methods can also apply to normal form diagrams. We assume the standard conditions in the
influence diagram literature such as “no forgetting”
[Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986].
6.1

One-way sensitivity analysis plots

The sample points method from the previous section
directly applies for extensive form influence diagrams
as well. It is also possible to plot the CE for a particular strategy s against τk using decision circuits. To
do this, the network parameters for decisions θd|pa(D)
need to be set according to s. Note that these have
been preset according to the current optimal strategy
s∗ after the initial upward sweep to evaluate the optimal strategy, hence they need to be reset if s 6= s∗ .
Once the network parameters for decisions are chosen
appropriately, we can sweep up and down the decision
circuit, treating the maximization nodes as summation
nodes on both sweeps.
Figure 4 is a one-way sensitivity analysis plot for the
influence diagram shown in Figure 2, with respect to
meta-parameter τ1 , the probability that the weather
is sunny. The plot displays the variation in the CE of
the decision problem as well as the CE of the current
optimal strategy s∗ with respect to changes in τ1 . We
observe that for most values of the meta-parameter,
the CE for the decision problem does not vary too
much, and thus the model is robust to small changes in
τ1 around its current value of 0.6. The figure supports
the intuition that for extreme values of the probability
of sunshine, it is optimal to decide whether to bring

Admissible intervals

In this section, as an extension of our discussion in
the section on normal form influence diagrams, we
present the admissible interval algorithm, which returns bounds on the range over a particular metaparameter for which the optimal strategy s∗ remains optimal when all other meta-parameters are
kept at their reference values. The algorithm finds
these bounds for all meta-parameters simultaneously.
We assume that the optimal strategy s∗ and the
M EU have already been evaluated from initial sweeps
through the decision circuit. The algorithm computes
partial derivatives from a downward sweep starting
from every maximization node. Before we describe the
algorithm, we distinguish between active and inactive
max nodes in the decision circuit. Inactive max nodes
are those maximization nodes such that the derivative
of the root with respect to these nodes, from the initial downward sweep, equals 0. This condition implies
that an inactive node does not affect the expected utility of s∗ , because there is 0 probability of being in that
situation. Active max nodes are those max nodes in
the circuit that are not inactive.
Admissible Interval Algorithm: Given a decision
circuit constructed for an influence diagram and evaluated at evidence e0 , with optimal strategy s∗ and
maximal expected utility M EU . Determine tight and
weak bounds on admissible intervals, Ik T and Ik W for
all meta-parameters τk , k = 1, 2, ..., K.
1. Initialize all intervals Ik T and Ik W to [0, 1].
2. Consider active max node v in the circuit. Find
the partial double derivatives for all alternatives
(as described in section 5) by sweeping down the

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above for inactive max node
v in the circuit, using Ik T in this case instead of
Ik W .
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above for all active and inactive max nodes in the decision circuit, updating
the two corresponding kinds of intervals.
6. Set Ik T to be the intersection of the corresponding
intervals Ik T and Ik W that were computed from
previous steps.
If there are no inactive max nodes then clearly Ik W =
Ik T , and this interval is the exact admissible interval.
We now prove the correctness of this algorithm.
Theorem 3. If τk lies in the interval Ik T then s∗ stays
optimal and if τk does not lie in the interval Ik W then
s∗ is no longer optimal.
Proof. Consider any meta-parameter τk and its associated interval Ik T . For τk ∈ Ik T , the equations in step
3 hold for all max nodes, since the resulting interval
Ik T is the intersection of intervals. Thus s∗ is the optimal strategy when τk ∈ Ik T . Now if τk ∈
/ Ik W , there
must be an active max node v such that the current
optimal alternative for v is no longer optimal. Therefore, s∗ can no longer be the optimal strategy. When
τk ∈
/ Ik T and τk ∈ Ik W , we cannot be sure about
whether s∗ stays optimal because it is possible for an
inactive node to become active for the new value of
τk .
Results from applying the algorithm to the example
shown in Figure 2 are presented in Table 1. Two metaparameters are considered for sensitivity analysis: the
probability of the weather being sunny, τ1 = θw , and
the specificity of the report, τ2 = θr̄|w̄ , which is a measure of the expected number of false positives from the
report. The table presents tight and weak intervals for
both meta-parameters. The exact admissible interval
for τ1 is [0.44, 0.84], as can be seen from Figure 4.
Note that this interval contains the tight interval but
lies within the weak interval. The algorithm is able to
compute the exact admissible interval for τ2 since the
specificity of the report does not affect the value when
evidence is not gathered.
