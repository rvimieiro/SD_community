Abstract

no restriction that a valid plan need have any sort of
compact (polynomial-size) representation.

We examine the computational complexity
of testing and finding small plans in prob­
abilistic planning domains with succinct rep­
resentations. We find that many problems
of interest are complete for a variety of com­
plexity classes: NP, co-NP, PP, NPPP, co­
NPPP, and PSPACE. Of these, the proba­
bilistic classes PP and NPPP are likely to
be of special interest in the field of uncer­
tainty in artificial intelligence and are deserv­
ing of additional study. These results suggest
a fruitful direction of future algorithmic de­
velopment.

These results are not directly applicable to the prob­
lem of finding good plans because they place no re­
strictions on the form of valid plans. It is possible, for
example, that for a given planning domain, the only
valid plans require exponential space (and exponential
time) to write down. Knowing whether or not such
plans exist is simply not very important.

INTRODUCTION

Recent work in artificial-intelligence planning has ad­
dressed the problem of finding effective plans in
domains in which operators have probabilistic ef­
fects (Kushmerick, Hanks, & Weld 1995; Draper,
Hanks, & Weld 1994; Dearden & Boutilier 1997;
Boutilier, Dearden, & Goldszmidt 1995; Boutilier,
Dean, & Hanks 1995). In probabilistic propositional
planning, operators are specified in a Bayes network
or an extended STRIPS-like notation, and the planner
is asked to determine a way of choosing operators to
achieve a goal configuration with some user-specified
probability. This problem is closely related to that of
solving a Markov decision process when it is expressed
in a succinct representation.
In previous work (Littman 1997; Mundhenk, Gold­
smith, & Allender 1996), we examined the complexity
of determining whether a valid plan exists; the prob­
lem is EXP-complete in its general form and PSPACE­
complete when we are limited to polynomial-depth
plans. For these results to hold, plans must be permit­
ted to be arbitrarily complicated objects, and there is

In the present paper, we consider the complexity of
a more practical and realistic problem-that of de­
termining whether or not a plan exists in a given re­
stricted form. The plans we consider take several pos­
sible forms that have been used in previous planning
work: totally ordered plans, partially ordered plans,
conditional plans, and looping plans. In all cases, we
limit our attention to plans that can be expressed in
size bounded by a polynomial in the size of the speci­
fication of the problem. This way, once we determine
that such a plan exists, we have some hope that we
can write it down in a reasonable amount of time.
In the deterministic planning literature, several au­
thors have addressed the computational complexity
of determining whether a valid plan exists, of deter­
mining whether a plan exists of a given cost, and
of finding the valid plans themselves under a vari­
ety of assumptions (Chapman 1987; Bylander 1994;
Backstrom & Klein 1991). These results provide lower
bounds (hardness results) for probabilistic planning,
since deterministic planning is a special case. In deter­
ministic planning, optimal plans can be represented by
a simple sequence of operators (totally ordered plan).
In probabilistic planning, good conditional plans will
often perform better than any totally ordered plan;
therefore, we need to consider the complexity of the
planning process for a richer set of plan structures.
The computational problems we look at are complete
for a variety of complexity classes ranging from NP to
PSPACE. Two results are deserving of special men-

The application of an action a in a

The objective is to choose actions to

The

and so can be used to choose the action to apply.
We are concerned with two main representations for
planning domains;

In this paper, we use a different succinct representa­
tion for planning domains that is more closely related

representations, which enu­

merate states explicitly, and succinct representations
(sometimes propositional, structured, or factored rep­
resentations), which view states as assignments to a set
of Boolean state variables. Compared to the size of the
representation, fiat domains typically have a polyno­
mial number of states and succinct domains have an
exponential number (though a "bad" succinct repre­
sentation can be as large as a flat one).
PP
1Toda (1991) showed that p#P =P , from which it fol­

lows that NP# =NPPP. Roughly speaking, #P is as pow­
erful as PP if used as an oracle.

21t is also possible to formulate the objective as one of
maximizing expected discounted reward (Boutilier, Dear­
den, & Goldszmidt 1995), but the two formulations are es­
sentially polynomially equivalent (Condon 1992) (the only
difficulty is that succinct domains may require discount
factors exponentially close to one for equivalence to hold).

abilities for an action

t(s, a, s'),

are represented by a

circuit of simple logic gates that takes as input succinct
representations of s and s' and outputs a probability
value in binary representation4.
Planning domains in the PSO and 2TBN representa­
tions can be converted to the circuit representation
in polynomial time, but it is not clear how to con­
vert a circuit to a PSO or

2TBN

in polynomial time.

However, this conversion can be carried out by a PP
machine (the basic idea is used in the proof of The­
orem 2.1), so the circuit representation is equivalent
to PSOs and 2TBNs in any complexity class contain­
ing PP. Since the complexity results we report for the
circuit representation are all for complexity classes at
least as hard as PP, these completeness results apply

to PSOs and 2TBNs as well.

EXAMPLE DOMAIN

To help make these ideas more concrete, consider the
following simple probabilistic planning domain based
on the problem of building a sand castle at the beach.
There are a total of four states in the domain, de3We assume that the number of bits used to represent

the individual probability values isn't too large.

4This implies that the transition probabilities have at
most as many bits as the circuit representing the domain
has gates. There are other circuit-based representations
that can represent probabilities with an exponential num­
ber of bits (Mundhenk, Goldsmith, & Allender 1996).

scribed by combinations of two Boolean state vari­
ables, moat and castle. The proposition moat sig­
nifies that a moat has been dug in the sand and the
proposition castle signifies that the castle has been
built. In the initial state, both moat and castle are
false, and the two states in which castle is true are
goal states.
There are two actions: dig-moat and erect-castle. Exe­
cuting dig-moat has two possible equiprobable effects,
"no op" (state does not change), and "moat" (moat
becomes true). The erect-castle action is more com­
plex. If moat is true, then the possible effects are
"castle" (probability 0.50), in which castle becomes
true, "no op" (probability 0.25), in which the state
doesn't change, and "collapse" (probability 0.25), in
which moat becomes false. On the other hand, if
moat is false when erect-castle is executed, then pos­
sible effects are "castle" (probability 0.25), in which
castle becomes true, and "no op" (probability 0.75),
in which the state doesn't change. The idea here is
that building a moat first protects the castle from be­
ing destroyed prematurely by the ocean waves.
To illustrate the circuit representation, Figure 1 gives
one possible circuit representation for the erect-castle
action. This circuit takes, as input, binary representa­
tions of the "before" state s and the "after" state s',
and outputs a binary representation of the probabil­
ity of reaching s' from s under the erect-castle action.
While this representation is not convenient for specify­
ing complex planning domains, more natural represen­
tations can be converted into this form automatically.
1.3

TYPES OF PLANS

We consider four basic classes of plans for probabilistic
domains: totally ordered, acyclic, looping, and par­
tially ordered. We illustrate examples from each of
these classes for the sand-castle domain in Figure 2. A
totally ordered plan is a sequence of actions that must

be executed in order. The plan terminates after the
final action in the plan has been executed, or whenever
a goal state is reached. For example, with probability
0.4375, the totally ordered plan in Figure 2(a)) suc­
cessfully builds a sand castle.
Acyclic plans generalize totally ordered plans to in­
clude conditional execution of actions. They are
roughly loop-free finite-state controllers for a planning
domain; they express a simple type of conditional plan
in which the next plan step to execute is a function of
the current step and an "effect label" that describes
the outcome of executing the current step. No step in
an acyclic plan may be repeated more than once during
plan execution. The acyclic plan in Figure 2(b) suc­
ceeds with probability 0.46875 and executes dig-moat
an average of 1. 75 times. Thus, it succeeds more often
and with fewer actions than the totally ordered plan
in Figure 2(a).

A partially ordered plan is a different way of gener­
alizing a totally ordered plan. It contains no loops
and no conditional branches, but can leave flexible the
precise sequencing of actions (Kushmerick, Hanks, &
Weld 1995). Figure 2(c) illustrates a partially ordered
plan for the sand-castle domain. The dashed arrows
indicate ordering constraints in contrast to solid ar­
rows, which indicate flow of controL There are two
distinct totally ordered plans consistent with the par­
tially ordered plan in Figure 2(c): dig-moat, dig-moat,
dig-moat, erect-castle, erect-castle and dig-moat, dig­
moat, erect-castle, dig-moat, erect-castle.

There are several possible interpretations for how the
performance of a partially ordered plan is measured.
The pessimistic interpretation is that the performance
of a partially ordered plan is equal to the performance
of the worst possible totally ordered plan consistent
with the partial order. This is closely related to the
standard interpretation in deterministic partial order
planning (McAllester & Rosenblitt 1991). The opti­
mistic interpretation of the performance of a partially
ordered plan is that it is the performance of the best
consistent totally ordered plan, and the average in­
terpretation is that it is the average over all possible
consistent orders.
Totally ordered, partially ordered, and acyclic plans
are all inherently finite horizon; plans terminate after
a polynomial number of actions. Looping plans gen­
eralize acyclic plans to the case in which plan steps
can be repeated (Smith & W illiamson 1995). This
type of plan is also referred to as a plan graph or pol­
icy graph (Kaelbling, Littman, & Cassandra 1995). A
looping plan can express an infinite-horizon strategy
because the plan will continue to execute as long as a
goal state is not reached (there is no a priori bound on

Proof

from plan steps

Let ¢> be a Boolean formula with n variables.
Define the planning domain M(¢>) with states
so, {0, 1}n, Bacc, Srej, one action a and transition proba­
bilities t( so, a, w) = 2- n, t(w, a, Sacc ) = 1 if w satisfies
¢>, and t( w, a, Brej)
1 if w does not satisfy ¢, for
wE {0, 1}n. Let Sacc be the only goal state. It is clear
that ¢> is in MAJSAT if and only if M(¢>) reaches the
goal state with probability at least 1/2 under the plan
that repeats action a twice.

w : S --+ :E is the transition mapping from states
of the planning domain to effects labels.

Note that the quantities Q, qo, :E, and 6 jointly specify
a deterministic finite-state automaton. Also, c5 may be
a partial function since some plan steps are final steps.
Let M be a planning domain and P be an acyclic plan.
Then M under P behaves as follows. Both M and P
are started "in parallel" in their initial states. Both
perform steps 1, 2,.. .. In step i ;:::: 1, let s be the
current state of M and q be the current plan step of P.
The current action is determined by the current state
q of P (i.e., the new state of M is s' with probability
t(s, 1r(q), s')) and P gets a translation of the new state
s' of M as an effects label (i.e., the new state of P is
6(q,w(s'))). If c5 is not defined on q, or s' is a goal
state, then the process stops.
Given these definitions, we can present our first com­
plexity result.
Theorem 2.1 The plan-evaluation problem for
acyclic and totally ordered plans is PP-complete.

To show PP-hardness, we give a reduction from
the PP-complete problem MAJSAT: given a Boolean
formula, do the majority of assignments satisfy it?

=

For membership in PP, note that a planning domain
M and an acyclic plan P induce a tree consisting of all
paths through M under P. This tree can be normal­
ized in a way that makes each path have equal proba­
bility, and an accepting leaf is reached with probabil­
ity at least 1/2 if and only if M reaches a goal state
with probability at least B. F inally, we can define a
polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machine that has
this tree as its computation tree.
•
The plan-existence problem is essentially equivalent to
guessing and evaluating a good plan, hence the prob­
lem is in NPPP. Hardness for NPPP can be shown us­
ing the techniques from a paper by Mundhenk, Gold­
smith, and Allender (1996). T he proof uses the idea
that every NPPP computation can be reduced to the

with more complex operator descriptions. Also, as the

partially ordered plan can be defined to be the evalua­
tion of the best, worst, or average member of the set of
consistent totally ordered plans; these are optimistic,
pessimistic, and average interpretations, respectively.
More formally, a partially ordered plan P is a directed
acyclic graph that has an action assigned to each node.
A totally ordered plan A = a1, ... , ak is consistent
with P if it satisfies the constraint that for all pairs
of nodes ai, aJ if ai is an ancestor of aJ in the partial
order, then i < j, i.e., ai comes before ai in the totally
ordered plan.
The plan-existence problem for partially ordered plans
under the optimistic interpretation asks whether­
given a domain M, a partially ordered plan P, and a
threshold 0-there is a totally ordered plan consistent
with P under which M reaches a goal state with prob­
ability at least B. Under the pessimistic interpretation,
we wish to know whether M reaches a goal state with
probability at least (;I under every consistent totally or­
dered plan. Under the average interpretation, we wish
to know whether M reaches a goal state with prob­
ability at least () averaged over all consistent totally
ordered plans.
The plan-existence problem for partially ordered plans
is identical to that for totally ordered plans. This is
because a totally ordered plan is a special kind of par­
tially ordered plan and its evaluation is unchanged un­
der the pessimistic, optimistic, or average interpreta­
tions. Conversely, the value of a partially ordered plan
under any interpretation is a lower bound on the value
of the best totally ordered plan.
Theorem 4.1 The plan-existence problem for par­
tially ordered plans is

NPPP -complete

under the pes­

simistic, o ptimistic and average interpretations.

The plan-evaluation problem for partially ordered
plans is different from that of totally ordered plans.
This is because a single partial order can encode an
exponential-size set of totally ordered plans, and eval­
uating the partially ordered plan involves figuring out
the best or worst member of this combinatorial set.
Theorem 4.2 The plan-evaluation problem for par­
tially ordered plans is

NPPP -complete

under the o p­

timistic interpretation, co-NPPP -complete under the
pessimistic interpretation, and PP -complete under the
average interpretation.

The proofs of the first two of these results are closely
related to the proof of Theorem 2.2. The average inter­
pretation problem can be shown to be in PP by com­
bining an argument showing how to average over con­
sistent totally ordered plans with the argument in the
proof of Theorem 2.1 showing how to evaluate a plan in

a succinct domain in PP. PP-hardness follows trivially
from Theorem 2.1, because totally ordered plans are a
special case of partially ordered plans and evaluating
totally ordered plans is PP-hard.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we explored the computational complex­
ity of plan evaluation and plan existence in probabilis­
tic domains. We found that, in succinctly represented
domains, restricting the form of the policies under
consideration reduced the computational complexity
of plan existence from EXP-complete for unrestricted
plans to PSPACE-complete for polynomial-size loop­
ing plans to NPPP -complete for polynomial-size acyclic
plans.
The class NpPP promises to be very useful to re­
searchers in uncertainty in artificial intelligence be­
cause it captures the type of problems resulting from
choosing a good combinatorial structure and then eval­
uating its probabilistic behavior. This is precisely the
type of problem faced by planning algorithms in prob­
abilistic domains, and may capture important prob­
lems in other domains as well, such as constructing
good Bayes networks from data.
The basic structure of our results is that if plan eval­
uation is complete for some class C, then plan ex­
istence is typically NPc -complete. This same basic
structure holds in deterministic domains: evaluating a
totally ordered plan in a succinct domain is P-complete
(for some typical representations) and determining the
existence of a polynomial-size totally ordered plan is
NPP =NP-complete.
There are several significant plan representations that
we did not explicitly consider in this work. However,
the results we presented do provide a goal deal of in­
sight into complexity results for other representations.
For example, Draper, Hanks, & Weld (1994) devised a
representation for partially ordered conditional plans
for the C-BURIDAN system. In this representation, each
plan step generates an observation label as a function
of the probabilistic outcome of the step. Each step
also has an associated set of context labels dictating
the circumstances under which that step must be ex­
ecuted. A plan step is executed only if its context
labels are consistent with the observation labels pro­
duced in earlier steps. This type of plan can be ex­
pressed as a succinct acyclic plan; Corollary 2.1 can
be used to show that the plan-evaluation and plan­
existence problems for partially ordered conditional
plans in succinct domains are PP-complete and NPPP­
complete, respectively. Other important plan struc­
tures to which our results can be applied include uni­
versal plans or policies (Dearden & Boutilier 1997) and

building effective algorithms based on these ideas.
