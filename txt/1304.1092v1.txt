Abstract

We describe a method for incrementally construct­
ing belief networks. We have developed a network­
construction language similar to a forward-chaining lan­
guage using data dependencies, but with additional
features for specifying distributions. Using this lan­
guage, we can define parameterized classes of proba­
bilistic models. These parameterized models make it
possible to apply probabilistic reasoning to problems
for which it is impractical to have a single large, static
model.
Introduction

We describe a method for incrementally construct­
ing belief networks. We have developed a network­
construction language similar to a forward-chaining lan­
guage using data dependencies, but with additional
features for specifying distributions. Using this lan­
guage, we can define parameterized classes of proba­
bilistic models. These parameterized models make it
possible to apply probabilistic reasoning to problems
for which it is impractical to have a single large, static
model.
There are a number of applications where such a fa­
cility would be useful. An expert system for genetic
counseling would be able to quickly draw up and eval­
uate a pedigree network for a given family. Our lan­
guage provides a convenient facility for combining gen­
eral knowledge from a domain theory ( in this case, ge­
netics) with facts about a specific case ( an individual
pedigree) . One could also diagnose machine faults in a
large class of machines, all built out of a given set of
components. For example, one could define a class of
models for diagnosing mechanical problems in motorcy­
cles. This class of models would defined in terms of the
operation of components. To create a instance of this
class of models for a particular motorcycle, one would
specify the values of parameters like fuel supply ( car­
buretion or fuel-ignition) , transmission ( chain or shaft) ,

number of cylinders, etc. For pattern theory, this ap­
proach would make it more convenient to experiment
with different topologies and bond functions.1
This technique is tailored to the production of be­
lief networks that can be incrementally constructed
and evaluated. We have been working with belief net­
works which are theoretically infinite. For computa­
tional practicality it is necessary that we be able to
confine our attention to small, directly relevant portions
of such networks. For such situations, our language
provides the ability to compose different probabilistic
influences in stereotyped ways.
In the next section of this paper, we will give a ( very)
brief introduction to belief networks, the graphical rep­
resentation we use for probability distributions. Then
we will give an outline of our language for belief network
construction. We will illustrate the use of our language
with a simple example from the domain of genetics.
Then we will outline the application of dynamically­
constructed belief networks to the problem of natural­
language understanding, and the way it has directed
the evolution of our network-construction language. Fi­
nally, we will discuss related work.
Belief Networks

Belief networks are directed acyclic graphs used to rep­
resent probability distributions.2 In a belief network,
nodes represent random variables, and arcs represent
direct influences between random variables. The prob­
ability distribution corresponding to a belief network
may be specified by giving a conditional probability ta­
ble for each node, conditioned on its parents. This local
representation makes possible the rule-based specifica­
tion of probability distributions that we describe here.
There are other graphical representations for prob­
ability problems that are also amenable to our ap­
proach. Belief networks are the most suitable to the
natural-language problems we face. For problems in

decision-theory, influence diagrams would be appropri­
ate [Schachter, 1986]. For problems in pattern theory,
Markov networks may be used. Because we have some
nodes between which it is difficult to assign a causal di­
rection, we are considering using chain graphs, which
mix directed and undirected edges [Lauritzen, 1988,
Frydenberg, 1989]. Our techniques would be equally ap­
plicable to these other representations; it would just be
necessary to adapt the way the local probability func­
tions are specified.

Our network-construction language

This section describes how rules are written in our
network-construction language, FRAIL3. FRAIL3 has
the following features:
•

It allows us to create propositions, random variables
in a belief network, which are also indexed as state­
ments in a first-order logic database.

•

In order that these belief networks be solved, FRAIL3
makes it convenient to specify the conditional prob­
ability matrices of these propositions, using declara­
tive knowledge stored in the logical database.

Our probabilistic database has a great deal in com­
mon with a deductive database with truth maintenance
(see [Charniak and McDermott, 1985] for an introduc­
tion, or [Doyle, 1979, McAllester, 1982, deKleer, 1986]).
Such a system combines a logic-programming language
with forward- and backward-chaining (bottom-up and
goal-directed inference, respectively) with a data depen­
dency, or justification, network. When statements are
added to the database, they are given a justification,
which records the antecedent statements necessary to
justify belief in the consequent.
Our database language is similar to a TMS language
in having rules for forward and backward reasoning. It
differs in allowing greater flexibility in specifying the
way arcs connecting database statements are added.
In a TMS, one always adds arcs (justifications) from
antecedent statements to consequents. However, in evi­
dential reasoning, we often want to chain from observed
statements to possible causes, and direct arcs from the
causes to the observation. Our rules allow us to spec­
ify independently the statements to be added to the
database, and the arcs to be drawn between them.
The data structures corresponding to the arcs are
also more expressive. Rather than having justifications,
we attach pfof'TII,8 to the statements in the database.
Pforms contain information which specifies the proba­
bilistic dependency of the node at the head of an arc
set on its direct ancestors. More formally, each pform
is a hyperedge from a set of statements to one state­
ment. This hyperedge corresponds to a set of edges in
a belief-network. See Figure 1
The important operators of our database language
are --+1 - , -- defpreddist and index In the next several

paragraphs we will discuss each of these operators and
how they work.
(- query antecedent(s)) To answer a request
for query, retrieve antecedent(s).
A conventional
backward-chaining rule.
( --+ trigger consequent :prob pforms) -+ is the ba­
sic network-constructing operator. When a statement
unifying with trigger is added to the database, apply
the bindings to consequent, and add it to the database.
The pforms control the way arcs are added to the net­
work, and give information about the way the condi­
tional probability matrices are set up at the tails of the
arcs. This information will be used by the distribution
functions discussed below. A sample rule:
Rule

1

(-+(condition ?x) :label ?caused
(causal-event ?x) :label ?cause
:prob ((?cause -+?caused ((tIt) .9) ((t If) :p))))
This states that whenever we predicate condition of
some entity, we should also postulate a corresponding

causal-event. The first part of the :prob argument spec­
ifies that we should draw an arc from the causal-event
node to the condition node. In order that we be able

to specify the addition of arbitrary arcs, we need to be
able to refer to statements by name. The :label oper­
ator provides this capability. In this rule, ?caused will
be bound to a pointer to the triggering statement, and

?cause will be bound to a pointer to the newly-added
statement. It should be emphasized that, unlike in a
conventional TMS language, which automatically adds
arcs from antecedents to consequents, we do not add
any arcs other than those explicitly designated by :prob
arguments to rules.
The second part of the :prob argument indicates that
when we draw up the conditional probability matrix
for the condition node, its probability given that causal­
ev ent is true is .9. Its probability given that causal-event
is false should default to the prior probability (the way
this defaulting can be done will be discussed below when
we discuss defpreddist).
( -++- additional-antecedent.! consequent pform8) If
FRAIL3 is told to add a statement of this form to its
database, it will try to retrieve additional-antecedent6,
and apply their variable bindings to assert con6equent.
This operator is often used to retrieve additional facts
from our domain knowledge. For example, the follow­
ing is a rule used in our language-understanding appli­
cation, for reasoning about word-senses:
Rule 2

(-+(word-inst ?i ?word) :label ?A
(-++-(word-sense ?word ?frame ?prob)
(inst ?i ?frame) :label ?C)
:prob ((?C -+?A) ((t I t) ?prob) ((t I f) (/ :p 100))))
This rule may be read as follows: If a node is added to
the network describing a new word-token (an instance
of a word), and if there is a statement in the database
specifying that one of the senses of this word is ?frame,
add a node for an instance of the type ?frame. Draw an
arc from this newly-added node (?C), to the word-inst
node (?A). When drawing up the probability matrix for
the word-inst node, use information about the frequency
with which it is used to express the concept frame, for
the case where the node for frame is true, else use a
default value of 1�0th of the prior probability.
Another common use of -++- is to collect additional
parents for a node. For example, one of the tasks for
our natural language system is to find referents for pr�
nouns. A desire to refer to an already-discussed person
or thing can be the explanation for using a pronoun. So
when we see a pronoun, we need to find all the previ­
ously known entities that are of the same gender as the
pronoun, and build arcs from them to the newly-added
statement. This requires the kind of combined forward­
and backward-chaining that -++-provides. A simplified
version of our pronoun rule follows:
Rule 3

( ->(word-inst ?i ?pronoun) :label ?PRONOUN
(-++-(and (inst ?x ?frame) :label ?POS-REFERENT
(compatible-gender ?pronoun ?frame))
(has-referent ?i) :label ?HAS-REF)
:prob (?POS-REFERENT -+?HAS-REF
((t It) (ref-prob ?frame ?pronoun)
((t If) o)))

(?HAS-REF -+?PRONOUN)
(((t It) 1) ((t If) .oooo1)))
(defpreddist predicate prior-fn po6terior-fn) These

rules are declarations, which tell us what functions to
use to set up the conditional probability matrices for
statements with predicate predicate. If such a state­
ment is a root node of the graph, prior-fn will be
called with the statement as an argument. Otherwise,
FRAIL3 will apply po6terior-fn to the pforms attached
to the statement. The function of the posterior-fn is to
combine the information from the various pforms.
We need defpreddist because our other rules are
not sufficient to quantify belief networks. There are
two cases where we fall short:
1. They do not allow us to specify distributions for
nodes without parents, and
2. they do not dictate how to fill out the conditional
probability distributions for nodes which have more
than one pform.
Problem (2), filling out the conditional probability dis­
tributions, arises in hand-construction of belief net­
works, as well. It occurs because, typically, rather than
being able to determine the probability of a random
variable conditioned on all direct influences, one only
has lower-order conditional probabilities.
Functions which we use as posterior-fns in our
language-processing application are noisy versions of
various logic gates: noisy-or, noisy-xor and noisy-and.
To see how these are used, consider the rule for word­
senses, given above as rule 2. The posterior-fn we use
for word-inst statements is xor-dist. Typically, words
are ambiguous, and have a number of senses. Each
such sense will give rise to a different pform. What
we want our posterior-fn to dictate is that each one of
these senses is a possible explanation for the use of the
given word, and that the senses are mutually exclusive.
Pseud�code for xor-dist is given as Figure 2. This is
a simple procedure which specifies that the probabil­
ity of a node given a state of its parents is 1 if that
conditioning-case satisfies one and only one pform, and
0 otherwise. 3
(index 6tatement) Adds statements to the first-order
logic database that are not also linked into the belief
network. Rules, and other non-ground formulae are
indexed.
An example from genetics

To give an idea of how our system can be used, we
give our treatment of an example in genetics. We have
adapted this example from [Jensen et al., 1988] and
[Spiegelhalter, 1988]. This example has been chosen
sA conditioning-case is a list of (node . state) pairs, and
a node-case is (node . state). This terminology is borrowed
from IDEAL[Srinivas and Breese, 1989].

solely for its convenience and clarity. Any errors should
be attributed to our ignorance about the domain.
We consider a gene with two allelles ( or values) , a1
and a2. Every individual's genotype consists of two
alleles, one inherited randomly from each parent. Be­
cause we have no way, in general, of knowing from which
parent a given allele has been inherited, we represent
genotypes as unordered pairs: a1a1, a1a2 or a2a2. a1
is recessive and gives rise to a detectable condition, a2
is dominant and does not. Therefore, the phenotypes
( the detectable conditions) are present corresponding
to genotype a1a1, and absent corresponding to geno­
types a1a2 and a2a2.
In order to model the situation resulting in popula­
tions with these genotypes, we need to know probabili­
ties determining the transmission of the genes from par­
ents to children. These are given in Figure 3. In order
to avoid infinite regress, we must make some assump­
tions about the genotypes of individuals about whose
ancestry we are ignorant (founders). We assume they
are members of a population in Hardy-Weinberg equi­
librium. This yields the follwing table of priors:

Finally, we need the penetrance probabilities: the
distribution of the phenotype given a genotype. A very
simple one is given in Figure 4.

The instantiate-observation statement above will not
be a real statement. We specify an assert function for
this predicate, so that when FRAIL3 is told to assert
such a statement, it will instead call the function add­
evidence on the statement to which ?PHENOTYPE is
bound.

In [Jensen et al., 1988], Jensen et. al. give an exam­
ple of a belief network for an example of incest. It is
given as Figure 5. Individual E is known to have the
condition. We would create a diagram corresponding
to this situation by asserting the following statements
into a database containing the above rules:

Auert function for instantiate-observation:
(defun assert-observation (pattern)
(add-evidence {second pattern)
{third pattern)))

(child C A B)
(child D B F)
(child E C D)
(observed-phenotype E :present)

(setf (assert-function imtantiate-observation)

It can be seen from the above how easy it is to use
FRAIL3 to combine information about a class of situa­
tions with the details of a particular case to construct
a complete probabilistic model.

Rule 7 Penetrance probability:
(penetrance-prob I)

Predicate definitiom:
(defpreddist genotype hardy-weinberg transmission)
(defpreddist phenotype nil simple-pform)

Rule 8

We should note a couple of features of the above rules.
First of all, note that we can use the same rules for
many different values of p and q, simply by changing
the prior-function for genotype nodes. Furthermore, we
can change the penetrance probability just by changing
rule 7. Finally, note that this scheme avoids adding

How we use dynamic belief networks

Our interest in belief networks has grown out of our
work on story understanding. The problem of story
understanding is to take a story written in some nat­
ural language, and "understand" it in the sense that
one's program could answer questions about it. It is
generally understood that this involves translating the
story into an internal representation which will support
•rr we so desired, we could also have phenotype nodes for
individuals about whom we would like to query.

the inferences necessary to answer questions. This in­
ternal representation should be an unambiguous repre­
sentation of the meaning of the text. In this translation
process, the program will make use of knowledge about
language and about the world the language is being
used to describe. Central to the problem of story un­
derstanding is plan-recognition: the ability to recognize
the plans and goals of characters in a story, based on
their actions.
For some time we have been interested in the prob­
lems posed by uncertainty in story understanding. Un­
certainty in language understanding comes from the
ambiguity which exists at all levels of natural-language:
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. Our current p�o­
gram, Wimp3, operates by turning problems of text m­
terpretation into probability questions such as "What
is the probability that this word has this sense, given
the evidence?" (where the evidence is the text of the
story so far), and "What is the probability that the ac­
tion described by the word plays a role in the actor's
plan to achieve some known goal?" Wimp3 does this
on a word-by-word basis. These probability questions
are formulated as belief networks.
The networks we create contain nodes describing the
text at all many levels of detail (see Figure 6 for an ex­
ample). At the leaves are the nodes describing the 'ev­
idence' we've observed: the input string. Above these
are nodes describing the denotations of the words in the
input (e.g., liquor-store3 in Figure 6). At the top of
the networks are descriptions of the plans of the char­
acters in the story ( liquor-sh.op-4 is a hypothesized plan
to buy liquor at a. liquor-store).
More precisely, Wimp3 works as follows:
1. A parser reads a. single word of the English text. It
produces statements which describe the words in the
story and the syntactic relations between them.
2. The output of the parser is used by the network con­
struction component. This component contains rules

for language abduction. It builds a net, or extends
the current net if some input has already been re­
ceived.
3. We collect the portion of the belief network which
may be affected by the most-recent additions to the
belief network. This sub-graph is evaluated by a
network-evaluation component. 5
4. If certain conclusions are overwhelmingly favored,
they may be accepted as true to simplify further com­
putation. Statements not rejected as too improbable
will trigger further network-expansion. If nodes are
added to the network, go to step 3, else, return to
step 1.
To return to the example of Figure 6, on the first iter­
ation after reading 'liquor-store' we will add the state­
ment (inst liquor-store3 liquor-store) to the database.
This hypothesis will not be eliminated as false when
the network is evaluated, so we will consider it further,
adding the nodes for a liquor-shopping plan. We do
this iterative expansion of the network to keep its size
small. For example, one possible (although unusual)
use of the word 'went' is to mean 'died', as in "Franco
went at 10 o'clock last night." In the context of "Jack
went to the liquor-store." this sense is clearly ruled out
by syntactic information. By expanding the belief net­
work incrementally, we avoid adding nodes to represent
explanations for the non-existent event of Jack dying.
We use the IDEAL system [Srinivas and Breese, 1989]
to evaluate the networks we Wimp3 creates. IDEAL is
a program allowing the specification of belief networks
and influence diagrams in LISP. It provides a framework
within which a number of network-solution algorithms
can be applied to such diagrams. Wimp3 creates net'This aspect of the work has not been thoroughly

construction of probabilistic models[Breese, 1989] . The
differences between his work and ours arise from the dif­
ferent problems we are trying to solve. Breese's method
is aimed at creating belief networks and influence dia­
grams in order to reply to queries. Because our work is
aimed at interpretation, and requires complex hypothe­
ses, we do not have clearly goal-directed networks.

Related Work

Another difference is that Breese does not have any­
thing corresponding to our posterior-functions. Asso­
ciated with his network-constructing rules are fully­
fleshed-out conditional probability distributions. When
more than one such distribution applies, his system
chooses which to apply according to some simple heuris­
tics. We need to be able to specify in greater detail
how to compare different probabilistic dependencies,
because our models are too big to describe more ex­
plicitly, and because nodes and arcs are added to and
deleted from our networks.

There has been a great deal of work on probabilis­
tic ATMS's for dynamically constructing probabilistic
models. An ATMS[deKleer, 1986] is a multiple-context
truth maintenance system. Laskey and Lehner [Laskey
and Lehner, 1988] have shown that Dempster-Shafer
theory can be mapped onto the ATMS in a straight­
forward way. D'Ambrosio developed a probabilistic
ATMS[D'Ambrosio, 1988a, D'Ambrosio, 1988b], and
we developed a probabilistic ATMS tailored for lan­
guage understanding [Goldman and Charniak, 1988].
In our experience, these logical-probabilistic hybrids
are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. Probabilis­
tic inference and logical inference do not correspond
perfectly. The operation of conditioning is not natu­
ral in logic. Logical inference does not permit us to
distinguish between evidential and causal support for a
proposition. Pragmatically, it seemed wasteful to com­
bine two expensive labelling procedures - ATMS con­
text labelling and probabilities.
We are greatly indebted to Judea Pearl for his idea
of combining causal influences in stereotyped ways like
the noisy-or gate [Pearl, 1988] . Our posterior-functions
are a generalization of this idea.
In work done simultaneously with ours, Jack Breese
has developed very similar techniques for rule-based

Two examples will clarify this important difference:
First of all, consider our rule for finding word-senses
(rule 2). If each word has a large number of possi­
ble senses, it is clearly impossible for us to store a full
conditional probability matrix for each word, given all
its senses. Impossible, and unnecessary as well, be­
cause the different causes interact in a stereotyped way.
Second, our interpretation problem is hierarchical: we
make hypotheses about actions and events to explain
the text, and then consider the plans and goals of char­
acters in the story in order to explain these actions and
events. We do not want to expand our networks to in­
clude plans hypothesized to explain characters' actions
until we are at least reasonably sure that the actions we
are trying to explain actually occurred - that we have

not simply misunderstood some verb. This leads to our
need to make root nodes into interior nodes.

ing is given in [Charniak and Goldman, 1989a, Carroll

Conclusions

In this paper we have outlined a language for construct­
ing belief networks on an as-needed basis. This lan­
guage of rules makes it convenient to define parameter­
ized classes of probabilistic models. Such parameterized
models are more convenient to use, and more efficient
to represent than full-blown belief networks. We have
·demonstrated the usefulness of this technique with a
simple example from genetics, and an account of our
work in language understanding.
