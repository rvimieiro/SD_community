Abstract
Many AI researchers argue that probability theory is only
capable of dealing with uncertainty in situations where a
fully specified joint probability distribution is available,
and conclude that it is not suitable for application in
AI systems. Probability intervals, however, constitute a
means for expressing incompleteness of information. We
present a method for computing probability interval! for
probabilities of interest from a partial specification of a
joint probability distribution.

Our method improves on

erties of this graph are then exploited for computing
precise intervals.
In Section 2 we introduce the notion of a partial
specification of a joint probability distribution. Fur­
thermore, the foundation for our method for comput­
ing probability intervals from such a partial specifi­
cation is layed. In Section 3 we discuss how indepen­
dency constraints can be taken into consideration. In
Section 4 we briefly point out that our method can
be of real help in the process of knowledge acquisition
for so-called belief networks.

Introduction

The adversaries of probability theory for dealing with
uncertainty in AI systems often argue that it is not
expressive enough to cope with the different kinds
of uncertainty that are encountered in real-life sit­
uations. More in specific, it has been argued that
probability theory is not able to distinguish between
uncertainty and ignorance due to incompleteness of
information. The suitability of probability intervals
for expressing incompleteness has been pointed out
decisively by J. Pearl in [Pearl, 1988a]. In this pa­
per, we present a framework for computing probabil­
ity intervals from an incomplete set of probabilities.
The general idea of our approach is to take the ini­
tially given probabilities as defining constraints on a
yet unknown joint probability distribution. Several
authors have already addressed the problem of com­
puting probability intervals, see for example (Cooper,
1984] and (Nilsson, 1986]. Our approach differs from
the mentioned ones by taking independency relation­
ships between the statistical variables discerned into
consideration. In order to do so, we assume that the
independencies in the unknown distribution are spec­
ified in a special type of graph. The topological prop-

In this section, we concentrate ourselves on the notion
of a partial specification of a joint probability distri­
bution and develop a method for computing proba­
bility intervals for probabilities of interest from such
a partial specification. For the moment, we assume
that no independencies between the statistical vari­
ables discerned exist. We begin by introducing some
terminology.
Let 8( a 1, .. .,a,.) be a free Boolean algebra gen­
erated by a set of atomic propositions A =
{al, ...,a,.}, n � 1; alternatively, the Boolean al­
gebra 8(a 1 ,...,a,.) may be viewed as a sample space
being 'spanned' by a set of statistical variables Ai,
i = 1, . .. ,n, each taking values from {ai,-.ai}· A
partial specification of a joint probability distribution

on B(a1, ... , a,.) is a total function P : C - [0, 1]
where C � 8( a 1 , ... , a,.). We call such a partial
specification consistent if there exists at least one
joint probability distribution Pr on 8 such that Pr
is an extension of P onto B(a1, ...,a,.) (notation:
Pr lc = P); otherwise, P is said to be inconsis­
tent. Furthermore, we say that P (uniquely) defines
Pr if Pr is the only joint probability distribution on
B(at, ...,a,.) such that Prlc = P. Now, let Bo be

greatest lower bound to the probability of b relative
to P. Note that this linear programming approach
can deal with conditional probabilities in the same
way in which it handles prior ones; furthermore, the
approach allows for initial specifications of bounds to
probabilities instead of point estimates.
It is well-known that an LP-problem can be solved
in polynomial time, that is, polynomial in the size of
the problem, (Papadimitriou, 1982). The size of an
LP-problem is dependent, among other factors, upon
the number of variables it comprises. Now note that
the specific type of problem discussed in the foregoing
has exponentially many variables, that is, exponential
in the number of statistical variables discerned in the
problem domain. Therefore, computing probability
intervals requires an exponential number of steps.

tionships exist and that the cliques are interrelated
only through their intersections. In order to be able
to exploit these properties, we further assume that all
initially given probabilities are local to the cliques of
G. Once more we introduce some new terminology.
Let G = (V(G), E(G)) be a decomposable graph
with the vertex set V(G) = {V1, ... , Vn}, n 2: 1, and
the clique set C/ (G) = {C/1, ..., Clm}, m 2: 1, to be
taken as a decomposable 1-map of an unknown joint
probability distribution Pr. We take the graph from
Figure l(a) as our running example. Let B be the free
Boolean algebra generated by {V; IV; E V(G)}; fur­
thermore, for each clique C/i, let B(Cli) � 6 be the
free Boolean algebra generated by {Vj I Vj E V(C/i)}.
Now, let P be a partial specification of a joint proba­
bility distribution on B (recall that all initially given
probabilities are local to the cliques of G). We say
that P is consistent with respect to G if P can be
extended in at least one way to a joint probability
distribution Pr on B such that Pr is decomposable
relative toG, that is, such that Pr can be expresssed

for each pair of cliques Cl;, Cli E Cl(G) with
V(Cii)n V(CI;) ¢ 0 we have that J.'CI,(V(Cl;)n
V(Clj)) = IJcz;(V(CI;) n V(Cij)); such a set M
is called a global extension of M.

It can be shown that global consistency of M is a
necessary and sufficient condition for P being consis­
tent with respect to G; further details are provided
in [Gaag, 1990].
We now apply the linear programming method
from the preceding section separately to each of the
partial specifications of marginal distributions asso­
ciated with the cliques of G. For each clique Cl; E
Cl( G) we now define a vector z; of constituent proba­
bilities of a yet unknown marginal distribution J.'CI, in
the manner described in Section 2. From the partial
specification met, associated with clique Cl; we then
obtain an appropriate system of linear constraints
with the constituent probabilities as unknowns. This
system will be denoted by D;z; = m;, z; 2 0. The

com-

hnear

�

system will be denoted by Dz = m, z !:: 0. To
guarantee that every nonne�a.tive solution to the t �u
obtained system of constramts defines an extenston
of the initially given probabilities to a joint proba­
bility distribution that is decomposable relative to
G, we have to augment the system with some ad­
ditional constraints, called independency constraints,
expressing that the set M of partial specifications
marginal distributions has to be globally consistent.
In theory we now have to obtain for each pair o
cliques Cli, Cl; E C/(G) with V(Cli) n V( Cli) # 0, a
number of constraints specifying that IJcz,(V(Cli)
V(Clj)) = J.'Ct·(V(CI;) n V(Clj)). However, if we
do so, we get �any redundant constraints; in fact,
the reader may verify that it suffices to obtain independency constraints from the clique intersections
represented in a join tree of G only. Figure l(b)
shows a join tree Ta of our example graph. Note
that the resulting independency constraints each in­
volve variables from two cliques only. In the sequel,
the system of independency constraints for the intersection of two cliques Cli and Clj will be denoted

by T;,j�i- Tj,i�i = 0; the system of independency
constraints obtained from an entire clique tree of G
will be denoted by T� = 0. From now on we will call
D� = m, T� = 0, � 2: 0, the joint system of con­
straints. Analogous to our observations in Section
2, we have that the problem of finding for a given
b e B (which is local to a clique of G), the least
upper bound to the probability of b is equivalent to
maximizing the probability of b subject to this joint
system of constraints. Again, a similar statement can
be made concerning the greatest lower bound to the
probability of b. It should be evident that in the
resulting probability interval the independency rela­
tionships shown in G have been taken into account
properly.
We can solve the linear programming problem dis­
cussed above using a traditional LP-program or a de­
composition method like Dantzig-Wolfe decomposi­
tion, [Papadimitriou, 1982]. In such a straightfor­
ward approach, however, the modular structure of
the problem at hand is not fully exploited. We will
present an algorithm for solving the problem in which
the computations are restricted to local computations
per clique only. First, we describe its basic idea in­
formally for our running example.
Consider Figure 2 in which the join tree Ta of
G has been depicted once more, this time explicitly
showing the clique intersections. We view Ta as a
computational architecture in which the vertices are
autonomous ohjuts holding the local systems of con­
straints as private data. These objects are only able
to communicate with their direct neighbours and only
'through' the independency constraints: the edges
are viewed as communication channels. The indepen­
dency constraints are used for relating variables from
one clique to variables from another one. Now, sup­
pose that we are interested in the least upper bound
to a probability of interest which is local to a specific
clique, like the one shown in the figure. The object
corresponding with the clique now sends a request
for information about further constraints, if any, to
its neighbours and then waits until it has received the
requested information from all of them. For the mo­
ment, each 'interior' object in the join tree just passes
the request on to its other neighbours and awaits the
requested information. As soon as a leaf( or the root)
of the tree receives such a request for information, a
second pass through the tree is started. The leaf com­
putes the feasible set of its local system of constraints
and derives from it (by means of projection) the set
of feasible values for the probabilities which are the
constituent probabilities for the intersection(s) with
its neighbour(s). This information then is passed on
to these neighbours via the appropriate communica-

tion channels using the independency constraints for
'translation' of the variables. This results in the ad­
dition of extra constraints to the local system of con­
straints of these neighbours. These computations are
performed by the interior vertices as well until the ob­
ject that started the computation has been reached
again. The arcs in Figure 2 represent the flow of com­
putation from this second pass through the join tree.
From its (extended) local system of constraints, the
object that started the computation may now com­
pute the least upper bound to our probability of inter­
est. The result obtained is the same as when obtained
directly from the joint system of constraints. The in­
tuition of this property is that when the process has
again reached the object that started the computa­
tion, this object has been 'informed' of all constraints
of the entire joint system. By directing the same pro­
cess once more towards the root and the leaves of the
tree, all objects can be brought into this state. So, in
three passes through a join tree, each object locally
has a kind of global knowledge concerning the joint
system of constraints. It will be evident that for any
probability of interest which is local to a clique we
can now compute a probability interval locally.
The

following algorithm describes

the computation is started by the root Cl, of the

ables, the algorithm will take polynomial time. An
important question for the algorithm to be of prac­
tical use is the question whether it is likely that the
mentioned restriction will be met in practice. Con­
cerning this, J. Pearl argues that sparse, irregular
graphs are generally appropriate in practical applica­
tions, [Pearl, 1988b].
The probability intervals obtained after application
of the algorithm may be rather wide, in fact they
may be too wide for practical purposes. However,
the intervals are precise and in a sense 'honest': they
just reflect the lack of knowledge concerning the joint
probability distribution.

intervals can guide the expert in providing further
information.
