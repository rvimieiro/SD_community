Abstract
A branch-and-bound approach to solving influence diagrams has been previously proposed in
the literature, but appears to have never been
implemented and evaluated – apparently due to
the difficulties of computing effective bounds
for the branch-and-bound search. In this paper,
we describe how to efficiently compute effective
bounds, and we develop a practical implementation of depth-first branch-and-bound search for
influence diagram evaluation that outperforms
existing methods for solving influence diagrams
with multiple stages.

Introduction

An influence diagram [7] is a compact representation of
the relations among random variables, decisions, and preferences in a domain that provides a framework for decision
making under uncertainty. Many algorithms have been developed to solve influence diagrams [2, 3, 8, 15, 17, 18,
19, 21]. Most of these algorithms, whether they build a
secondary structure or not, are based on the bottom-up dynamic programming approach. They start by solving small
low-level decision problems and gradually build on these
results to solve larger problems until the solution to the
global-level decision problem is found. The drawback of
these methods is that they can waste computation in solving decision scenarios that have zero probability or that are
unreachable from any initial state by following an optimal
decision policy.
This drawback can be overcome by adopting a branch-andbound approach to solving an influence diagram that uses
a search tree to represent all possible decision scenarios.
This approach can use upper bounds on maximum utility
to prune branches of the search tree that correspond to lowquality decisions that cannot be part of an optimal policy;
it can also prune branches that have zero probability.

A branch-and-bound approach to influence diagram evaluation appears to have been first suggested by Pearl [16].
He proposed it as an improvement over the classic method
of unfolding an influence diagram into a decision tree and
solving it using the rollback method, which itself is a form
of dynamic programming [7]. In Pearl’s words:
A hybrid method of evaluating influence diagrams naturally suggests itself. It is based on
the realization that decision trees need not actually be generated and stored in their totality to produce the optimal policy. A decision
tree can also be evaluated by traversing it in a
depth-first, backtracking manner using a meager amount of storage space (proportional to the
depth of the tree). Moreover, branch-and-bound
techniques can be employed to prune the search
space and permit an evaluation without exhaustively traversing the entire tree... an influence diagram can be evaluated by sequentially instantiating the decision and observation nodes (in
chronological order) while treating the remaining chance nodes as a Bayesian network that supplies the probabilistic parameters necessary for
tree evaluation. (p. 311)
However, neither Pearl nor anyone else appears to have
followed up on this suggestion and implemented such an
algorithm. The apparent reason is the difficulty of computing effective bounds to prune the search tree. Qi and
Poole [17] proposed a similar search-based method for
solving influence diagrams, but with no method for computing bounds; in fact, their implementation relied on the
trivial infinity upper bound to guide the search. Recently,
Marinescu [12] proposed a related search-based approach
to influence diagram evaluation. But again, he proposed no
method for computing bounds; his implementation relies
on brute-force search. Even without bounds to prune the
search space, note that both Qi and Poole and Marinescu
argue that a search-based approach has advantages – for
example, it can prune branches that have zero probability.

In this paper, we describe an implemented depth-first
branch-and-bound search algorithm for influence diagram
evaluation that includes efficient techniques for computing bounds to prune the search tree. To compute effective bounds, our algorithm adapts and integrates two previous contributions. First, we adapt the work of Nilsson
and Höhle [14] on computing an upper bound on the maximum expected utility of an influence diagram. The motivation for their work was to bound the quality of strategies
found by an approximation algorithm for solving limitedmemory influence diagrams, and their bounds are not in
a form that can be directly used for branch-and-bound
search. We show how to adapt their approach to branchand-bound search. Second, we adapt the recent work of
Yuan and Hansen [20] on solving the MAP problem for
Bayesian networks using branch-and-bound search. Their
work describes an incremental method for computing upper
bounds based on join tree evaluation that we show allows
such bounds to be computed efficiently during branch-andbound search. In addition, we describe some novel methods
for constructing the search tree and computing probabilities
and bounds that contribute to an efficient implementation.
Our experimental results show that this approach leads to
an exact algorithm for solving influence diagrams that outperforms existing methods for solving multistage influence
diagrams.

Background

We begin with a brief review of influence diagrams and
algorithms for solving them. We also introduce an example
of multi-stage decision making that will serve to illustrate
the results of the paper.
2.1

Influence Diagrams

An influence diagram is a directed acyclic graph G containing variables V of a decision domain. The variables can be
classified into three groups, V = X ∪ D ∪ U, where X is
the set of oval-shaped chance variables that specify the uncertain decision environment, D is the set of square-shaped
decision variables that specify the possible decisions to be
made in the domain, and U are the diamond-shaped utility variables representing a decision maker’s preferences.
As in a Bayesian network, each chance variable Xi ∈ X
is associated with a conditional probability distribution
P (Xi |P a(Xi )), where P a(Xi ) is the set of parents of Xi
in G. Each decision variable Dj ∈ D has multiple information states, where an information state is an instantiation of
the variables with arcs leading into Dj ; the selected action
is conditioned on the information state. Incoming arcs into
a decision variable are called information arcs; variables at
the origin of these arcs are assumed to be observed before
the decision is made. These variables are called the information variables of the decision. No-forgetting is typically

assumed for an influence diagram, which means the information variables of earlier decisions are also information
variables of later decisions. We call these past information
variables the history, and, for convenience, we assume that
there are explicit information arcs from history information
variables to decision variables. Finally, each utility node
Ui ∈ U represents a function that maps each configuration
of its parents to a utility value the represents the preference of the decision maker. (Utility variables typically do
not have other variables as children except multi-attribute
utility/super-value variables.)
The decision variables in an influence diagram are typically
assumed to be temporally ordered, i.e., the decisions have
to be made in a particular order. Suppose there are n decision variables D1 , D2 , ..., Dn in an influence diagram. The
decision variables partition the variables in X into a collection of disjoint sets I0 , I1 , ..., In . For each k, where
0 < k < n, Ik is the set of chance variables that must
be observed between Dk and Dk+1 . I0 is the set of initial
evidence variables that must be observed before D1 . In is
the set of variables left unobserved when decision Dn is
made. Therefore, a partial order ≺ is defined on the influence diagram over X ∪ D, as follows:
I0 ≺ D1 ≺ I1 ≺ ... ≺ Dn ≺ In .

(1)

A solution to the decision problem defined by an influence
diagram is a series of decision rules for the decision variables. A decision rule for Dk is a mapping from each configuration of its parents to one of the actions defined by
the decision variable. A decision policy (or strategy) is a
series of decision rules with one decision rule for each decision variable. The goal of solving an influence diagram
is to find an optimal decision policy that maximizes the expected utility. The maximum expected utility is equal to

In general, the summations and maximizations are not
commutable. The methods presented in Section 2.3 differ
in the various techniques they use to carry out the summations and maximizations in this order.
Recent research has begun to relax the assumption of ordered decisions. In particular, Jensen proposes the framework of unconstrained influence diagrams to allow a partial
ordering among the decisions [9]. Other research relaxes
the no-forgetting assumption, in particular, the framework
of limited-memory influence diagrams [10]. Although the
approach we develop can be extended to these frameworks,
we do not consider the extension in this paper.

To illustrate decision making using multi-stage influence
diagrams, consider a simple maze navigation problem [6,

14]. Figure 1 shows four instances of the problem. The
shaded tiles represent walls, the white tiles represent movable space, and the white tiles with a star represent goal
states. An agent is randomly placed in a non-goal state. It
has five available actions that it can use to move toward the
goal: it can move a single step in any of the four compass
directions, or it can stay in place. The effect of a movement
action is stochastic. The agent successfully moves in the
intended direction with probability 0.89. It fails to move
with probability 0.089, it moves sideways with probability 0.02 (0.01 for each side), and it moves backward with
probability 0.001. If movement in some direction would
take it into a wall, that movement has probability zero, and
the remaining probabilities are normalized. The agent has
four sensors, one for each direction, which sense whether
the neighboring tile in that direction is a wall. Each sensor is noisy; it detects the presence of a wall correctly with
probability 0.9 and mistakenly senses a wall when none is
present with probability 0.05. The agent chooses an action
at each of a sequence of stages. If the agent is in the goal
state after the final stage, it receives a utility value of 1.0;
otherwise, it receives a utility value of 0.0.
Figure 2(a) shows the influence diagram for a two-stage
version of the maze problem. The variables xi and yi represent the location coordinates of the agent at time i, the variables {nsi , esi , ssi , wsi } are the sensor readings in four
directions at the same time point, and the variable di represents the action taken by the agent. The utility variable
u assigns a value depending on whether or not the agent
is in the goal state after the last action is taken. Since the
same variables occur at each stage, we can make the influence diagram arbitrarily large by increasing the number of
stages.
2.3

Evaluation algorithms

Many approaches have been developed for solving influence diagrams. The simplest is to unfold an influence diagram into an equivalent decision tree and solve it in that
form [7]. Another approach called arc reversal solves an
influence diagram directly using techniques such as arcreversal and node-removal [15, 18]; when a decision variable is removed, we obtain the optimal decision rule for the
decision. Several methods reduce influence diagrams into

Bayesian networks by converting decision nodes into random variables such that the solution of an inference problem in the Bayesian network correspond to the optimal decision policy for the influence diagram [3, 21]. Another
method [19] transforms an influence diagram into a valuation network and applies variable elimination to solve the
valuation network. Recent work compiles influence diagrams into decision circuits and uses the decision circuits
to compute optimal policies [2]; this approach takes advantage of local structure present in an influence diagram, such
as deterministic relations.
In the following, we describe a state-of-the-art method for
solving an influence diagram using a strong join tree [8].
This method is viewed by many as the fastest general algorithm, and we use its performance as a benchmark for our
branch-and-bound approach. A join tree is strong if it has
at least one clique, R, called the strong root, such that for
any pair of adjacent cliques, C1 and C2 , with C1 closer to
R than C2 , the variables in separator S = C1 ∩ C2 must
appear earlier in the partial order defined in Equation (1)
than C2 \ C1 . A strong join tree for the influence diagram
in Figure 2(a) is shown in Figure 2(b).
An influence diagram can be solved exactly by message
passing on the strong join tree. Each clique C in the join
tree contains two potentials, a probability potential ϕC and
a utility potential ψC . For clique C2 to send a message to
clique C1 , ϕC1 and ψC1 should be updated as follows [8]:

information arcs from each variable in R to D is guaranteed to have a maximum expected utility that is greater than
or equal to the maximum expected utility for G. We call G∗
an upper-bound influence diagram for G.

In contrast to the join tree algorithm for Bayesian networks [11], only the collection phase of the algorithm is
needed to solve an influence diagram. After the collection
phase, we can obtain the maximum expected utility by carrying out the remaining summations and maximizations in
the root. In addition, we can extract the optimal decision
rules for the decision variables from some of the cliques
that contain these variables.

Use of an upper-bound influence diagram to compute
bounds only makes sense if the upper-bound influence diagram is simpler and much easier to solve than the original
influence diagram. In fact, adding information arcs to an
influence diagram can simplify its evaluation by making
some other information variables non-requisite. An information variable Ii is said to be non-requisite [10, 13] for a
decision node D if

Building a join tree for a Bayesian network may fail if the
join tree is too large to fit in memory. This is also true
for influence diagrams. In fact, the memory requirement of
a strong join tree for an influence diagram is even higher
because of the constrained order in Equation (1). Consequently, the join tree algorithm is typically infeasible for
solving all but very small influence diagrams.

Computing bounds

To implement a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving
influence diagrams, we need a method for computing
bounds – in particular, for computing upper bounds on the
utility that can be achieved beginning at a particular stage
of the problem, given the history up to that stage. A trivial upper bound is the largest state-dependent value of the
utility node of the influence diagram. In this section, we
discuss how to compute more informative bounds. There
has been little previous work on this topic. Nilsson and
Höhle [14] develop an approach to bounding the suboptimality of policies for limited-memory influence diagrams
that are found by an approximation algorithm. Dechter [4]
describes an approach to computing upper bounds in an
influence diagram that is based on mini-bucket partitioning. Neither work considers how to use these bounds in a
branch-and-bound search algorithm.
The approach we develop in the rest of this paper is based
on the work of Nilsson and Höhle [14], which we extend by
showing how it can be used to compute bounds for branchand-bound search. The general strategy is to create an influence diagram with a value that is guaranteed to be an
upper bound on the value of the original influence diagram,
but that is also much easier to solve. We use the fact that
additional information can only increase the value of an influence diagram. Since this reflects the well-known fact
that information value is non-negative, we omit (for space
reasons) a proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let G be an influence diagram and D a decision variable in G. Let I be D’s information variables
and R another set of random variables in G that are nondescendants of D. Then the influence diagram G∗ that results from making R into information variables by adding

(2)

where de(D) are the descendants of D. A reduction of
an influence diagram is obtained by deleting all the nonrequisite information arcs [14].
Because of the no-forgetting assumption, a decision variable at a late stage may have a large number of history information variables. For decision making under imperfect
information, all of these information variables are typically
requisite. As a result, the size of the decision rules grows
exponentially as the number of decision stages increases,
which is the primary reason multi-stage influence diagrams
are very difficult to solve.
In constructing an upper-bound influence diagram, we want
to add information arcs that make some or all of the history
information variables for a decision node non-requisite, in
order to simplify the influence diagram and make it easier to solve. We adopt the strategy proposed by Nilsson
and Höhle [14]. Let nd(X) be the non-descendant variables of variable X, let f a(X) = P a(X) ∪ {X} be the
family of variable X (i.e., the variable and its parents), let
f a(X) = ∪Xi ∈X f a(Xi ) be the family of the set of variables X (i.e., the variables and their parents), and let △j be
{D1 , ...Dj } be a sequence of decision variables from stage
1 to stage j. The following theorem is proved by Nilsson
and Höhle [14].
Theorem 2. For an influence diagram with the constrained
order in Equation (1), if we add to each decision variable
Dj the following new information variables in the order of
j = n, ..., 1,
Nj = arg minB⊆(Bj ∩nd(Dj )) {|B||f a(△j )
⊥ (U ∩ de(Dj ))|(B ∪ {Dj })},

What this theorem means is that for each decision variable Dj in an influence diagram, there is a set of information variables Nj such that the optimal policy for Dj depends only on these information variables, and is otherwise
history-independent. Note that the set Nj for decision variable Dj can contain both information variables from the
original influence diagram and information variables created by adding new information arcs to the diagram. The
set Nj of information variables can be interpreted as the
current “state” of the decision problem, such that if the decision maker knows the current state, it does not need to
know any previous history in order to select an optimal action; in this sense, the state satisfies the Markov property.

(b)

We call Nj a sufficient information set (SIS) for Dj . The intuition behind this approach is illustrated by Figure 3. The
shaded oval shows the SIS set ND for decision D. The
past state affects the variables in ND ∪ {D}, illustrated by
the arc labeled 1, and ND ∪ {D} affects the future state,
as illustrated by arc 2. The future state further determines
the values of the utility variables. ND ∪ {D} d-separates
the past and future states and prevents the direct influence
shown by arc 3. The concept of a sufficient information set
is related to the concept of extremality, as defined in [21],
and the concept of blocking, as defined in [13].
To construct an upper-bound influence diagram, we find the
SIS set for each decision in the order of Dn , ..., D1 and
make the variables in each SIS set information variables
for the corresponding decisions. We then delete the nonrequisite information arcs. Consider the influence diagram
in Figure 4(a) as an example. The information set for d1 is
originally {ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 , d0 , ns1 , es1 , ss1 , ws1 }. We
find that its sufficient information (SIS) set is {x1 , y1 }. We

states and the minimum sufficient information set.

Consider a decision-making problem in a partially observable domain, such as the maze domain of Section 2.2. The
agent cannot directly observe its location in the maze and
must rely on imperfect sensor readings to infer its location.
In this domain, adding information arcs from the location
variables to a decision variable, so that the agent know the
current location at the time it chooses an action, makes both
current and history sensor readings non-requisite, which results in a much simpler influence diagram, which in this
case serves as an upper-bound influence diagram.

also find that the SIS set for d0 is {x0 , y0 }. By making
{x1 , y1 } and {x0 , y0 } information variables for d1 and d0
respectively, and reducing the influence diagram, we obtain
the much simpler influence diagram in Figure 4(a). The
strong join tree for the new influence diagram is shown in
Figure 4(b), which is also much smaller than the strong
join tree for the original model. Since the upper-bound influence diagram assumes the actual location is directly observable to the agent, it effectively transforms a partially
observable decision problem into a fully observable one.
The resulting influence diagram and, hence, its join tree is
much easier to solve.
Finding the sufficient information set (SIS) for a decision
variable in an influence diagram is equivalent to finding a
minimum separating set in the moralized graph of the influence diagram [14]. Acid and de Campos [1] propose
an algorithm based on the Max-flow Min-cut algorithm [5]
for finding a minimum separating set between two sets of
nodes in a Bayesian network with some of the separating
variables being fixed. We use their algorithm to find the SIS
sets. The two sets of nodes are f a(△j ) and U ∩ de(Dj ).
The only fixed separating variable is Dj . The algorithm
first introduces two dummy variables, source and sink, to
the moralized graph. The source is connected to the neighboring variables of f a(△j ), and the sink to the variables in
de(Dj ) ∩ an(U ∩ de(Dj )). We then create a max-flow network out of the undirected graph by assigning each edge
capacity 1.0. A solution gives a minimum separating set
between the sink and source that contains Dj .
We briefly mention some issues that are not described by
Nilsson and Höhle [14], but that need to be considered in
an implementation. The first issue is how to define the size
of an SIS set. Theorem 2 uses the cardinality of the SIS
set as the minimization criterion. Another viable choice is
to use weight, defined as the product of number of states,
of the variables in an SIS set as the minimization criterion.

The relation between these two criteria is similar to the relation between treewidth and weight in constructing a junction tree. While treewidth tells us how complex a Bayesian
network is at the structure level, weight provides an idea
on how large the potentials of the junction tree are at the
quantitative level. Both methods have been used. In our
implementation, we use the cardinality.
A second issue is that multiple candidate SIS sets may exist
for a decision variable. In that case, we need some criterion
for selecting the best one. In our implementation, we select
the candidate SIS set that is closest to the descendant utility
variables of the decision. Note that other candidate sets are
all d-separated from the utility node by the closest SIS set.
This choice has the advantage that the resulting influence
diagram is easiest to evaluate; however, other choices may
result in an influence diagram that gives a tighter bound.

Branch-and-bound search

In this section, we describe how to use the upper-bound
influence diagram to compute bounds for a depth-first
branch-and-bound search algorithm that solves the original influence diagram. We begin by showing how to represent the search space as an AND/OR tree. A naive approach to computing bounds requires evaluating the entire upper-bound influence diagram at each OR node of the
search tree, which is computationally prohibitive. To make
branch-and-bound search feasible, we rely on an incremental approach to computing bounds proposed by Yuan and
Hansen [20] for solving the MAP problem in Bayesian networks using branch-and-bound search. We show how to
adapt that approach in order to solve influence diagrams
efficiently.
4.1

AND/OR tree search

We represent the search space for influence diagram evaluation as an AND/OR tree. The nodes in an AND/OR tree
are of two types: AND nodes and OR nodes. AND nodes
correspond to chance variables; a probability is associated
with each arc originating from an AND node and the probabilities of all the arcs from an AND node sum to 1.0. The
OR nodes correspond to decision variables. Each of the
leaf nodes of the tree has a utility value that is derived from
the utility node of the influence diagram.
Qi and Poole [17] create an AND/OR tree in which each
layer of AND nodes alternates with a layer of OR nodes.
Each AND node in this tree corresponds to the information
set of a decision variable in the influence diagram, which
is a set of information variables. To compute the probability for each arc emanating from an AND node in this
tree, however, it is necessary to have the joint probability distributions of all the information sets; these are often
not readily available, since variables in the same informa-

tion set can belong to different clusters of a join tree. For
computational convenience, our AND/OR tree is based on
the structure of the strong join tree in Figure 4(b). For the
maze example, we order the variables in the information set
{ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 } according to the order in Equation (5).
Note that the join tree does not have a clique that contains
all four variables; in fact, they are all in different cliques.
So we consider the variables one by one. That means that
our AND/OR tree allows several layers of AND nodes to
alternate with a layer of OR nodes. See Figure 5 for an
example of the kind of AND/OR tree constructed by our
search algorithm, and note that the first four layers of this
AND/OR tree are all AND layers.
Each path from the root of the AND/OR tree to a leaf corresponds to a complete instantiation of the information variables and decision variables of the influence diagram, that
is, a complete history. Since we use the AND/OR tree to
find an optimal decision policy for the original influence
diagram, we have to construct an AND/OR tree that is consistent with the original constrained order. For the influence
diagram in Figure 2(a), the partial order is
{ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 } ≺ {d0 } ≺ {ns1 , es1 , ss1 , ws1 }
≺ {d1 } ≺ {x0 , y0 , x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , u},
(5)
and the decision variables must occur in this order along
any branch.
We define a valuation function for each node in an
AND/OR tree as follows: (a) for a leaf node, the value is
its utility value; (b) for an AND node, the value of is the
sum of the values of its child nodes weighted by the probabilities of the outgoing arcs; (c) for an OR node, the value
is the maximum of the summed utility values of each child
node and corresponding arc. We use this valuation function
to find an optimal strategy for the influence diagram.
We represent a strategy for a multi-stage influence diagram
as a policy tree that is defined as follows. A policy tree of
an AND/OR tree is a subtree such that: (a) it consists of
the root of the AND/OR tree; (b) if a non-terminal AND
node is in the policy tree, all its children are in the policy
tree; and (c) if a non-terminal OR node is in the policy

tree, exactly one of its children is in the policy tree. Given
an AND/OR tree that represents all possible histories and
strategies for an influence diagram, the influence diagram
is solved by finding a policy tree with the maximum value
at the root, where the value of the policy tree is computed
based on the valuation function. Depth-first branch-andbound search can be used to find an optimal policy tree.
The AND/OR tree is constructed on-the-fly during the
branch-and-bound search, and it is important to do so in a
way that allows the probabilities and values to be computed
as efficiently as possible. We use the maze problem and the
AND/OR tree in Figure 5 as an example. (The upper-bound
influence diagram and join tree are shown in Figure 4.) We
have already pointed out that including more layers in our
AND/OR tree allows us to more easily use the probabilities
and utilities computed by the join tree. If we start by expanding ns0 (where expanding a node refers to generating
its child nodes in the AND/OR tree), we need the probabilities of P (ns0 ) to label the outgoing arcs. We can readily
look up the probabilities from clique (0, 1, 2) after an initial full join tree evaluation. Note that we use the join tree
of the upper-bound influence diagram to compute the probabilities. We can do that because these probabilities are the
same as those computed from the original influence diagram. This is due to the fact that the same set of actions
will reduce both models into the same Bayesian networks.
Adding information arcs to an influence diagram, in order
to create an upper-bound influence diagram, only changes
the expected utilities of the decision variables.
After expanding ns0 , we expand any of {es0 , ss0 , ws0 }.
Suppose the next variable is es0 , we need the conditional
probabilities of es0 given ns0 . These probabilities can be
computed by setting the state of ns0 as new evidence to
the join tree and evaluating the join tree again. The same
process is used in expanding {ss0 , ws0 }.
Note that we do not have to expand one variable at a time.
If a clique has multiple variables in the same information set, the variables can be expanded together because a
joint probability distribution over them can be easily computed. Expanding them together also saves the need to
do marginalization. For example, variables x1 , y1 , x2 , y2
(7,8,14,15) are in the same information group and also reside in a same clique. In this case, we can expand them as
a single layer in the AND/OR tree.
After {ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 } are expanded, we expand d0 as
an OR layer. This is where the upper bounds are needed.
We set the states of {ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 } as evidence to the
join tree and compute the expected utility values for d0 by
reevaluating the join tree. The expected utilities of d0 are
upper bounds for the same decision scenarios of the original model. We can use the upper bounds to select the most
promising decision alternative to search first. The exact
value will be returned once the subtree is searched. If the

value is higher than the upper bounds of the remaining decision alternatives, these alternatives are immediately pruned
because they cannot be part of an optimal decision policy.
We repeat the above process until a complete policy tree is
found.
4.2

Incremental join tree evaluation

It is clear that repeated join tree evaluation has to be performed in computing the upper bounds and conditional
probabilities. A naive approach is at each time to set the
states of instantiated variables as evidence and perform a
full join tree evaluation. However, that is too costly. We can
use an efficient incremental join tree evaluation method to
compute the probabilities and upper-bound utilities, based
on the incremental join tree evaluation method proposed by
Yuan and Hansen [20] for solving the MAP problem.
The key idea is that we can choose a particular order of the
variables that satisfies the constraints of Equation (5) such
that an incremental join tree evaluation scheme can be used
to compute the information. Given such an order, we know
exactly which variables have been searched and which variable will be searched next at each search step. We only
need to send messages from the parts of the join tree that
contain the already searched variables to a clique with the
next search variable. For example, after we search es0 , the
only message needs to be sent to obtain P (ns0 |es0 ) is the
message from clique (0, 1, 3) to (0, 1, 2). There is no need
to evaluate the whole join tree. If we choose the following
search order for the maze problem
ns0 , es0 , ss0 , ws0 , d0 , ns1 , es1 , ss1 , ws1 , d1 , x0 , y0 ,
x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ,
we can use an incremental message passing in the direction
of the dashed arc in Figure 4(b) to compute the probabilities
and upper bounds needed in one downward pass of a depthfirst search.
Both message collection and distribution are needed in this
new scheme, unlike evaluating a strong join tree for the
original influence diagram. The messages being propagated contain two parts: utility potentials and probability
potentials. The distribution phase is typically needed to
compute the conditional probabilities. For example, suppose we decide to expand es0 before ns0 , we have to
send a message from clique (0, 1, 3) to (0, 1, 2) to obtain
P (ns0 |es0 ). We only need to send the probability potential in message distribution. We do not need to send utility
potentials because past payoffs do not count towards the
expected utilities of future decisions.

Table 1: Comparison of three algorithms (join tree algorithm, DFBnB using the join tree bounds, and exhaustive search of
the AND/OR tree) in solving maze problems a and b for different numbers of stages. The symbol ‘-’ indicates the problem
could not be solved, due to memory limits in the case of the join tree algorithm, or due to a three-hour time limit in the
case of the search algorithms. Running time is in hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s) and milliseconds. Memory (mem.) is
in megabytes and is the peak amount of memory used by the algorithm; “policy” is the count of nodes (both OR and AND
nodes) in the part of the search tree containing the optimal policy tree – it is the same for both DFBnB and exhaustive
search; “#bounds” is the count of times a branch from an OR node was pruned based on bounds; “#zeros” is the count of
times a branch from an AND node was pruned because it had zero probability.
search makes sure that the search need not jump to a different search branch before backtracking is needed. In other
words, the join tree only needs to work with one search
history at a time.
We do need to backtrack to a previous search node once
we finish a search branch or realize that a search branch is
not promising and should be pruned. We need to retract all
the newly set evidence since the generation of that search
node and restore the join tree to a previous state. One way
to achieve this is to reinitialize the join tree with correct
evidence and perform a full join tree evaluation, which we
have already pointed out is too costly. Instead, we cache
the potentials and separators along the message propagation path before changing them by either setting evidence
or overriding them with new messages. When backtracking, we simply restore the most recently cached potentials
and separators in the reverse order. The join tree will be
restored to the previous state with no additional computations. This backtracking method is much more efficient
than reevaluating the whole join tree. For solving the MAP
problem for Bayesian networks, Yuan and Hansen [20]
show that the incremental method is more than ten times
faster than full join tree evaluation in depth-first branchand-bound search.

Empirical Evaluation

We compared the performance of our algorithm against
both the join tree algorithm [8] and exhaustive search of
the AND/OR tree (i.e., no bounds are used for pruning).
Experiments were run on a 2.4 GHz Duo processor with 3
gigabytes of RAM running Windows XP.
The results in Table 1 are for the two maze problems in
Figure 1, which we solved for different numbers of stages.
When there are only two or three stages, the join tree al-

gorithm is most efficient. This is because the strong join
trees for these influence diagrams are rather small and can
be built successfully. Once the join trees are built, only
one collection phase is necessary to solve the influence diagram; by contrast, the depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm (DFBnB) algorithm must perform repeated message
propagations to compute upper bounds and probabilities
during the search. For more then three stages, however, the
join tree algorithm cannot solve the maze models because
the strong join trees are too large to fit in memory. Because the exhaustive search algorithm only needs to store
the search tree and policy, it can solve the maze models
for up to four stages, although it takes more then 45 minutes to do so. The DFBnB algorithm can solve the maze
models for up to five stages in less time than it takes the
exhaustive search algorithm to solve them for four stages,
demonstrating the advantage of using bounds to prune the
search tree. Table 1 includes the number of times a branch
of the search tree is pruned based on bounds, as well as the
number of times a branch with zero probability is pruned.
For the maze models with their original parameter settings,
every branch of the search tree has non-zero probability.
Previous work has argued that one of the advantages of
search algorithms for influence diagram evaluation is that
they can prune branches of the search tree that have zero
probability, even without bounds [12, 17]. To test this argument, as well as to illustrate the effect of different problem
characteristics on algorithm performance, we modified the
maze models described in Section 2.2. First, we removed
some noise from the sensors. Each of the four sensors reports a wall in the corresponding direction of the compass.
In the original problem, each sensor is noisy; it detects the
presence of a wall correctly with probability 0.9 and mistakenly senses a wall when none is present with probability
0.05. As a result, every sensor reading is possible in every state and there are no zero-probability branches. We

Table 2: Comparison of three algorithms (join tree algorithm, DFBnB using the join tree bounds, and exhaustive search
of the AND/OR tree) in solving maze problems a and b with modified parameters; for the results in the top table, some
noise is removed from the sensors only; for the results in the bottom table, some noise is removed from the actions and the
sensors. Removing some noise from the actions and sensors results in more zero-probability branches that can be pruned,
allowing the search algorithms (but not the join tree algorithm) to solve the problem for a larger number of stages.
modified the model so that each sensor accurately detects
whether a wall is present in its direction of the compass.
With this change, the maze problem remains partially observable, but the search tree contains many zero-probability
branches, as can be seen from the results in Table 2. Since
the search algorithms can prune zero-probability branches,
the exhaustive search algorithm can now solve the problem
for up to five stages and the DFBnB algorithm can solve
the problem for up to six stages.
We next made an additional change to the transition probabilities for actions. In the original problem, the agent successfully moves in the intended direction with probability
0.89 (as long as there is not a wall). It fails to move with
probability 0.089, it moves sideways with probability 0.02
(0.01 for each side), and it moves backward with probability 0.001. We modified these transition probabilities so that
the agent still moves in the intended direction with probability 0.89; but otherwise, it stays in the same position with
probability 0.11. The effects of the agent’s actions are still
stochastic, but they are more predictable, and this allows
the search tree to be pruned even further. As a result, the

exhaustive search algorithm can solve the problem for up to
six stages and the DFBnB algorithm can solve the problem
for up to seven stages.
Note that changing the problem characteristics has no effect on the performance of the join tree algorithm. The
join tree algorithm solves the influence diagram for all information states, including those that have zero probability
and those that are unreachable from the initial state; as a
result, its memory requirements explode exponentially in
the number of stages and the algorithm quickly becomes
infeasible. Although the policy tree that is returned by the
search algorithms can also grow exponentially in the number of stages, it does so much more slowly because so many
branches can be pruned. As is vividly shown by the results
for the two different mazes and for different parameter settings, the performance of the search algorithms is sensitive
to problem characteristics – precisely because the search
algorithms exploit a form of problem structure that is not
exploited by the join tree algorithm. In addition, the results
show the effectiveness of bounds in scaling up the searchbased approach.

Conclusion

We have described the first implementation of a depthfirst branch-and-bound search algorithm for influence diagram evaluation. Although the idea has been proposed
before, we adapted and integrated contributions from related work and introduced a number of new ideas to make
the approach computationally feasible. In particular, we
described an efficient approach for using the join tree algorithm to compute upper bounds to prune the search tree.
The idea is to generate an upper-bound influence diagram
by allowing each decision variable to be conditioned on additional information that makes the remaining history nonrequisite, thus simplifying the influence diagram. Then
a join tree of the upper-bound influence diagram is used
to incrementally compute upper bounds for the depth-first
branch-and-bound search. We have also described a new
approach to constructing the search tree based on the structure of the strong join tree of the upper-bound influence
diagram. Experiments show that the resulting depth-first
branch-and-bound search algorithm outperforms the stateof-the-art join tree algorithm in solving multistage influence diagrams, at least when there are more than three
stages.
We are currently considering how to extend this approach
to solve limited-memory influence diagrams [10], which
typically have many more stages. We are also exploring approaches to compute more accurate bounds for pruning the
search tree. Finally, we are considering approximate and
bounded-optimal search algorithms for solving larger influence diagrams using the same upper bounds and AND/OR
search tree.
