Abstract
This paper develops a measure for bounding the
performance of AND/OR search algorithms for
solving a variety of queries over graphical models. We show how drawing a connection to the
recent notion of hypertree decompositions allows
to exploit determinism in the problem specification and produce tighter bounds. We demonstrate on a variety of practical problem instances
that we are often able to improve upon existing
bounds by several orders of magnitude.

INTRODUCTION

This paper develops a measure for bounding the performance of search algorithms for solving a variety of queries
over graphical models. It has been known for a while that
the complexity of inference algorithms (e.g., join-tree clustering, variable elimination) is exponentially bounded by
the tree width of the graphical model’s underlying graph.
The base of the exponent is often taken to be the maximum
domain size.
More accurate bounds were derived by looking at the
respective domain sizes and their product in each cluster in of tree decomposition of the underlying graph
[Kjærulff, 1990]. These tighter bounds were used in selecting good variable orderings, for example. It was recently
shown that these bounds are also applicable to search algorithms that explore the context-minimal AND/OR search
graph [Dechter and Mateescu, 2007].
The shortcoming of these bounds is that they are completely blind to context-sensitivity hidden in the functions
of the graphical model and especially determinism. When
a problem possesses high levels of determinism, its tree
width bound can be large while its search space can be
extremely pruned, due to propagation of inconsistencies
across functions.
Part of this shortcoming in worst-case complexity bounds

is addressed by the more recent concept of hypertree decompositions [Gottlob et al., 2000]. It was shown that the
maximum number of functions in the clusters of a hypertree decomposition (the hypertree width) exponentially
bounds the problem complexity for constraint inference, a
result that was extended to general graphical model inference in [Kask et al., 2005]. The base of the exponent in
this case is the relation tightness, thus allowing the notion
of determinism to play a role. However, in practice this
bound often turns out to be far worse than the tree width
bound, unless the problem exhibits substantial determinism
[Dechter et al., 2008].
The contribution of this paper is in combining both ideas to
tighten the existing bounds, using the relationship between
AND/OR graph search and tree decompositions. Starting
with the tree width bound, we show that one can also incorporate the concept of hypertree decompositions by greedily
covering variables with tight functions. This yields better
bounds on the number of nodes in the search graph, which
translates directly to search complexity.
Tighter bounds are desirable for a number of reasons:
1. We can better predict parameters of the algorithm
ahead of time (primarily the variable ordering for
search), fitting the algorithm to the problem.
2. It enables us to dynamically update parameters during
search, e.g., for dynamic variable orderings.
3. In a distributed setup, search can often be implemented as centralized conditioning followed by independent solving of the conditioned subproblems on
different machines. Better bounds can help in balancing these two phases by varying the size of the central
conditioning set [Silberstein et al., 2006].
We provide extensive empirical results on 112 probabilistic problem instances and 30 weighted constraint satisfaction problems. We show that exploiting determinism has a
significant effect for a number of problem classes. We furthermore compare our bound to the exact size of the search
space on a subset of feasible instances, and show that it can
be very tight in some cases.

An approach that is related but orthogonal to the work here
is described in [Zabiyaka and Darwiche, 2006], where the
standard complexity measure of tree width is refined by
taking into account functional dependencies – i.e., knowing one set of variables determines the values of another
set. [Fishelson et al., 2005] develops a bound specifically
for an interleaved variable elimination and conditioning algorithm on linkage analysis problems.
Section 2 provides the background and definitions. Section
3 discusses hypertree decompositions and related complexity bounds. In Section 4 we introduce our new bounding
scheme, for which Section 5 provides empirical evaluation.
Section 6 concludes.

PRELIMINARIES AND DEFINITIONS

In the following we will assume a graphical model given as
a set of variables X = {x1 , . . . , xn }, their finite domains
D = {D1 , . . . , Dn }, a set of functions F = {f1 , . . . , fm },
each of which is defined over a subset of X, and a combination operator (typically sum, product or join) over all
functions. Together with an marginalization operator such
as minX and maxX we obtain a reasoning problem.
The special cases of reasoning tasks which we have in
mind are belief networks, (weighted) constraint networks
or mixed networks that combine both. The primary tasks
over belief networks are belief updating and finding the
most probable explanation. They are often specified using
conditional probability functions defined on each variable
and its parents in a given directed acyclic graph (see Figure 1(a)), and use multiplication and summation or maximization as the combination and marginalization operators [Kask et al., 2005]. For constraint networks we are
mainly concerned with problems of finding or enumerating solutions; they are defined using relations as functions, and relational join and projection as the combination
and marginalization operators, respectively. For weighted
constraint networks one typically has real-valued functions and summation and minimization as combination and
marginalization operators, respectively.
2.1

EXPRESSING STRUCTURE

If one wants to analyze the complexity of a given problem instance, it has proven useful to look at the underlying
structure of interactions between variables:
D EFINITION 2.1 The hypergraph of a graphical model is
a pair H = (V, S), where the vertices are the problem
variables (V = X) and where S = {S1 , ..., Sr } is a set of
subsets of V , called hyperedges, which represent the scopes
of the functions in the problem (Si = scope(fi )). The primal graph of a hypergraph H = (V, S) is an undirected
graph G = (V, E) such that there is an edge (u, v) ∈ E

(a)

(b)

(c)

along ordering d = A, B, C, D, E, F , and the corresponding
bucket tree decomposition.

for any two vertices u, v ∈ V that appear in the same hyperedge (namely, there exists Si , s.t., u, v ∈ Si ). The dual
graph of a hypergraph H = (V, S) is an undirected graph
G = (S, E) that has a vertex for each hyperedge, and there
is an edge (Si , Sj ) ∈ E when the corresponding hyperedges share a vertex (Si ∩ Sj 6= ∅).
D EFINITION 2.2 A hypergraph is a hypertree, also called
acyclic hypergraph, if and only if its dual graph has an
edge subgraph that is a tree, such that all the nodes in the
dual graph that contain a common variable form a connected subgraph.
It is well-known that problems whose underlying
graph have tree structure can be solved efficiently
[Pearl, 1988].
If this is not the case, we aim to
transform the problem into an equivalent one that exhibits tree structure [Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988,
Dechter and Pearl, 1989, Kask et al., 2005]. Intuitively, we
do this by grouping variables and the functions over them
into clusters that can be arranged as a tree:
D EFINITION 2.3 Let X, D, F be the variables, domains
and functions of a reasoning problem P. A tree decomposition of P is a triple hT, χ, ψi, where T = (V, E) is a
tree and χ and ψ are labeling functions that associate with
each vertex v ∈ V two sets, χ(v) ⊆ X and ψ(v) ⊆ F , that
satisfy the following conditions:
1. For each fi ∈ F , there is at least one vertex v ∈ V
such that fi ∈ ψ(v) .
2. If fi ∈ ψ(v), then scope(fi ) ⊆ χ(v) .
3. For each variable Xi ∈ X, the set {v ∈ V |Xi ∈ χ(v)}
induces a connected subtree of T . This is also called
the running intersection property.
The tree width of a tree decomposition hT, χ, ψi is w =
maxv |χ(v)| − 1 . The tree width w∗ of P is the minimum
tree width over all its tree decompositions.
The problem of finding the tree decomposition of minimal
tree width is known to be NP-complete. To obtain tree decompositions in practice, one can apply a triangulation algorithm to the problem’s primal graph along an ordering

and then construct the bucket tree by extracting and connecting the cliques for each variable, as described for instance in [Pearl, 1988]. The ordering to use as the basis for
the triangulation algorithm is often computed heuristically.
Example 2.1 Assume the belief network in Figure 1(a)
over variables X = {A, B, C, D, E, F } is given. We pick
the ordering d = A, B, C, D, E, F and triangulate the primal graph as shown in Figure 1(b). If we extract each
variable’s bucket – the variable and its earlier neighbors
– we obtain the tree decomposition shown in Figure 1(c),
the bucket tree decomposition.
2.2

SOLVING REASONING PROBLEMS

Two principal methods exist to solve reasoning problems, search (e.g., depth-first branch-and-bound, best-first
search) and inference (e.g., variable elimination, join-tree
clustering). Both can be shown to be time and space exponential in the problem instance’s tree width [Lauritzen
and Spiegelhalter, 1988, Dechter and Pearl, 1989, Kask et
al., 2005, Dechter and Mateescu, 2007], with a dominant
factor of k w , where k denotes the maximum domain of the
problem variables.
2.2.1

Search

Search-based algorithms traverse the problem search
space. Given a variable ordering d, the simplest way to perform search is to instantiate variables one at a time. This
will define a search tree, where each node represents a state
in the space of partial assignments. Leaf nodes signify either full solutions or dead ends. Standard depth-first algorithms typically have time complexity exponential in the
number of variables and require linear space. If memory
is available, one can apply caching to traversed nodes and
retrieve their values when “similar” nodes are encountered.
These elementary search spaces, however, don’t fully
capture the structure of the underlying graphical model.
Introducing AND nodes into the search space can exploit independence of subproblems by effectively conditioning on values, thus avoiding redundant computation [Dechter and Mateescu, 2007]. Since the size of the
AND/OR search tree may be exponentially smaller than
the traditional OR search one, any algorithm exploring the
AND/OR space enjoys a better computational bound.
Example 2.2 Figure 2 depicts the AND/OR search tree for
the problem introduced in Example 2.1 if we assume binary
variable domains and the ordering d = A, B, C, D, E, F .
The AND nodes for variable B each have two OR children,
expressing that at this point the problem decomposes into
independent subproblems, rooted at C and E, respectively.
We can equally apply caching techniques to an algorithm
exploring the AND/OR search tree. As a result this algo-

search with caching.

rithm will effectively explore the AND/OR search graph.
With caching, identical subproblems are recognized based
on their context, which is a graphical model parameter that
denotes the part of the search tree above that is relevant to
the subproblem below.
Caching will avoid redundant computations, thus reducing
time complexity, at the cost of increased memory requirements. By varying the maximum size of contexts to cache
on, this tradeoff can be fine-tuned. Assuming full caching,
search has been shown to exhibit both time and space complexity exponential in the problem’s tree width.
Example 2.3 If we extend AND/OR search with caching,
given the problem in Example 2.1 it will explore the
AND/OR search graph shown in Figure 3. Note how the
child nodes of variables C and E are merged. This expresses the fact that in the example the subproblems rooted
at D and F , as children of C and E, respectively, are independent of the value of A further up.
2.3

EXPLOITING DETERMINISM

In practice, however, problem instances across many domains will exhibit a significant degree of determinism (e.g.,
disallowed tuples in constraint problems, zero probability
entries in belief networks). Search algorithms detect the
resulting inconsistencies early in the search process and
prune the respective portion of the search space. This can
lead to significant savings in running time, but is not reflected in the standard worst-case bounds described above.
To exploit determinism in the context of variable elimination, the concept of (generalized) hypertree decompositions has been introduced for constraint networks in

[Gottlob et al., 2000]. As a subclass of tree decompositions, it was shown that it provides a stronger indicator of
tractability than the tree width.
D EFINITION 2.4 Let T = hT, χ, ψi, where T = (V, E)
be a tree decomposition of a reasoning problem P over a
graphical model with variables X, their domains D and
functions F . T is a hypertree decomposition of P if the
following additional condition is satisfied:
S
4. For each v ∈ V , χ(v) ⊆ fj ∈ψ(v) scope(fj ) .
The hypertree width of a hypertree decomposition is
hw = maxv |ψ(v)|. The hypertree width hw∗ of P is the
minimum hypertree width over all its hypertree decompositions.
To analyze the complexity of algorithms operating on hypertree decompositions, we introduce the notion of tightness of a function or relation:
D EFINITION 2.5 The tightness t of a function f is the
number of relevant tuples (e.g., allowed tuples in constraints, nonzero entries in conditional probability tables).
The motivation behind this is to store and process the function in a “compressed” form, with only the t relevant tuples.
Given a hypertree decomposition, one can then modify an
inference algorithm to make use of these compact representations when computing the messages to be passed.
In [Gottlob et al., 2000] the complexity of processing a
hypertree decomposition for solving a constraint satisfaction problem is shown to be exponential in hw∗ , with
∗
a dominant factor of thw . This result was extended in
[Kask et al., 2005] to any graphical model that is absorbing relative to 0. (A graphical model is absorbing relative
to a 0 element
if its combination operator has the property
N
that x 0 = 0 ∀x; for example, multiplication has this
property while summation does not.)

HYPERTREE WIDTH BOUNDS FOR
INFERENCE

In this section we briefly explore whether the bounds based
on hypertree width can provide a practical improvement
over the established tree width bounds described above. To
that end we recently looked at a selection of over 140 problem instances from various domains [Dechter et al., 2008].
We used the code developed for [Dermaku et al., 2005],
which is available online. It generates a tree decomposition
along a minfill ordering and extends it to a (generalized)
hypertree decomposition by applying a greedy heuristic.
We used the lowest tree width w and hypertree width hw
out of 20 runs as a basis for our investigation: For every
problem instance, we compute the dominant factors of the

two worst-case complexity bounds, i.e., k w and thw , where
k denotes the maximum domain size and t the maximum
function tightness in the problem instance. In order for
the hypertree decomposition to provide a better bound than
the tree decomposition, thw should be significantly smaller
than k w .
Intuitively, it is clear that t ∈ O(k r ), where r is the maximum function arity of the problem. Hence we should expect that only when the function table contains many irrelevant values (e.g., zeros in probability tables), the hypertree
width bound can be superior.
And indeed, out of all the instances we evaluated, only for
five of them was thw less than k w , whereas it was orders of
magnitude worse on almost all of the remaining problems.
Looking at the instances in more detail, it becomes evident
that in most of them the functions are not sufficiently tight
and often have highly intersecting scopes, which renders
the hypertree width bound ineffective.

SEARCH SPACE ESTIMATION

Even though the results in [Dechter et al., 2008] suggest
that complexity bounds based on hypertree width are often not competitive in practice, the idea of exploiting determinism remains promising. Furthermore, while all considerations in section 3 were targeted at inference algorithms, we are in particular interested in estimating how
determinism in a problem will impact the size of the search
space discussed in Section 2.2.1, since search is a widespread method in practice. To that end, we will aim to upper bound the size of the AND/OR context minimal search
graph, which is explored by AND/OR search augmented
with caching, as described in Section 2.
4.1

TREE DECOMPOSITION
CORRESPONDENCE

Assume that a variable ordering d = x1 , . . . , xn is fixed
and that search instantiates variables first to last (while inference would proceed last to first). We note that the way
the search space is decomposed by AND/OR search with
caching can be represented by the bucket tree decomposition along the same ordering. For details we refer to
[Mateescu and Dechter, 2005], to illustrate we revisit our
previous example:
Example 4.1 Consider the bucket tree decomposition in
Figure 1(c) and the AND/OR search graph in Figure 3. It is
easy to see that the decomposition clusters can be related
to the “layers” of the search graph, i.e., the nodes associated with a variable and its values, as shown in Figure 4.
For instance, the cluster {B, C, D} represents the search
layer for variable D and the fact that the subproblem only
depends on B and C – and not A.

Figure 4: The AND/OR search graph with clusters corresponding
to the bucket tree decomposition in Figure 1(c).

Based on this observation, we can also partition the
search space into “clusters”, according to the corresponding bucket tree decomposition. Our approach of upper
bounding the size of the entire search space will then be
to bound the portion of the search space in each cluster,
subsequently summing over the clusters (for simplicity we
consider only the AND nodes of the search space, since
OR nodes are actually not implemented as such in practice). We note that a cluster in a bucket tree decomposition
will always correspond to exactly one variable’s layer in the
AND/OR search graph (due to the way it is constructed).
4.2

BOUNDING CLUSTER SIZE

A straightforward upper bound is obtained by multiplying the domain sizes of all variables in the cluster
[Kjærulff, 1990]. If the set of clusters is given by C =
{C1 , . . . , Cn }, Ck ⊆ X, summing over clusters gives
n
X
Y
|Di | .
twb :=
k=1 xi ∈Ck

Note that this is very closely related to the worst case complexity, since the tree width is just the maximum number of
variables in any cluster of the decomposition. This, however, does not take determinism into account.
If the bucket tree decomposition we are working with is
also a hypertree decomposition (meaning all variables in a
cluster are covered
Q by the functions in that cluster), we can
take the product i ti as an upper bound to the number of
nodes in that cluster, where ti is the tightness of the i-th
function in it. (This is closely related to the complexity
bound on hypertree decompositions as outlined above.)
Taking this one step further, if the bucket tree decomposition at hand does not satisfy the additional hypertree decomposition condition, we can compute the product over
the tightness of each function in the cluster and multiply
this by the domain sizes of the uncovered variables, to account for the lack of information about these variables.
However, since the scopes of the different functions in a
cluster can overlap, this tightness based bound will typically be worse than the simple “product of domain sizes”
(as we already observed). Consequentially, we use the latter as a starting point and exploit tight functions to improve

upon it, therefore combining the concept of tree and hypertree decompositions.
In essence this can be seen as a weighted variant of the
well-known SET COVER problem, where one aims to
cover a set or vertices by as few as possible subsets from a
set of given subsets of the variables. The problem is generally NP-complete, but simple greedy approximations exist
[Johnson, 1973], which give rise to our method:
Start with an empty covering (if we assume dummy unary
functions over uncovered variables, this is equivalent to
the bound twb). Then, for each function fj in the cluster,
compute the coverage ratio rj as follows: Divide the function’s tightness tj by the product over the domain sizes of
the variables that have not yet been covered and are in the
scope of fj . Pick the function for which the coverage ratio
is the lowest and add it to the covering. Repeat this for as
long as we can still find a function with a coverage ratio
less than 1. The algorithm is given in Figure 5.
It will produce a set of functions as the covering, but might
leave some variables uncovered. As before, we can multiply the tightness of the functions in the covering and the
domain sizes of the uncovered variables to obtain an upper
bound on the number of nodes in the cluster.
It is worth noting that we are not limited to functions from
the decomposition cluster in question, but we can include
any function from the clusters higher up in the rooted tree
decomposition (since their scope will have been fully instantiated at this point of the search).
Proposition 1 Executing algorithm GreedyCovering for
each cluster of the bucket tree decomposition and summing
up, we obtain an upper bound on the number of nodes in
the AND/OR search graph, which we denote:

that these three bounds can produce very large integers,
therefore we report them as their log10 in Table 1.) Even for
the larger problem instances this bound computation takes
only a few hundred milliseconds on a 2.66 GHz CPU.
5.1

Proof. The time complexity of algorithm GreedyCovering
is linear both on the number of variables in the cluster as
well as in the number of functions considered, i.e., worstcase O(w · m). Keeping track of the coverage ratio of each
function requires O(m) space. Iterating and summing over
all n clusters results in the stated asymptotic bounds.

Example 4.3 Assume we have a cluster containing 3 variables X, Y , Z with domain sizes dX = 4, dY = 4, and
dZ = 3, as well as 2 functions f1 (X, Y ) and f2 (Y, Z)
with tightness t1 = 9 and t2 = 11. The twb bound on the
number of nodes in this cluster is dX · dY · dZ = 48. In
the first iteration of the greedy covering algorithm for hwb
9
the gain ratios of f1 and f2 will be computed as 16

respectively.
Therefore

ing, leaving only Z uncovered. The next gain ratio of f2
will be computed as 11
3 , which is greater than 1. Therefore the algorithm terminates and f2 will not be part of
the covering. The hwb bound for this cluster will then be
t1 · dZ = 9 · 3 = 27.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

For empirical evaluation we return to the problem instances
that were described in [Dechter et al., 2008] (see also Section 3). These comprise 112 belief networks from areas
such as coding networks, dynamic Bayesian networks, genetic linkage instances and CPCS medical diagnosis networks. We also evaluated 30 weighted constraint network
instances. All problem instances are available online1 .
For every instance, we report the number of variables n,
the maximum variable domain size k, the maximum function arity r, and the average tightness ratio tr (defined as
the average percentage of relevant tuples in a full function
table).
On each problem instance we run our bounding method
along 100 different minfill orderings (with random tie
breaking) and record the lowest bound, with w as the
tree width of the bucket tree decomposition. For every instance we then compute the asymptotic worst-case
bound for the search space size, which is n · k w+1 (cf.
[Dechter and Mateescu, 2007], adapted for AND nodes).
Consulting the bucket tree decomposition for a more finegrained analysis (still without considering determinism)
gives the bound twb. We then apply our covering heuristic
to exploit determinism and obtain the bound hwb. (Note

BOUND IMPROVEMENTS

If we compare the values for n · k w+1 and twb, we can see
that the bound improves for every problem instance by at
least one order of magnitude, but often more than that (recall that the table shows log10 of the bounds). For most
pedigree genetic linkage instances, for example, the reduction is ten orders of magnitude or more. Similar results
hold for the dynamic Bayesian networks we tested on, with
many orders of magnitude improvement.
It seems that problems with a higher number of variables
benefit the most from the fine-grained analysis. This makes
sense if one considers the fact that the worst-case bound
will greatly overestimate the size of almost all clusters,
since in practice the tree decomposition contains only very
few clusters of full tree width.
If we try to exploit determinism by going from the twb to
hwb bound, there is, just looking at the problem parameters, no obvious indicator for when the bound will improve: On pedigree instances, for example, the decrease is
not very significant, although these problems exihibit some
determinism. On digital circuits, on the other hand, with an
average of 50% determinism, the bound improves another
3 to 4 orders of magnitude over twb.
On almost all weighted CSP instances we were able to
lower the bound by exploiting determinism, often by orders of magnitude. For example, on the satellite scheduling
problem 408b the twb bound of 83, 206, 198, 094 decreases
to a hwb value of 248, 197. A significantly tighter bound
is also achieved on randomly generated k-trees where the
probability tables were forced to exihibit determinism, with
for example twb = 29, 983, 742 decreasing to hwb =
1, 528 on problem BN 107.
The crucial point here seems to be at which point during
the search functions with high determinism will have their
scope fully instantiated, i.e., at which point they become
available to our covering heuristic. This is not predictable
by only looking at the instance parameters but will require
a more detailled look at the guiding bucket tree decomposition instead.
5.2

BOUND EVALUATION

Most problem instances are too big to compute the exact
size of the context minimal AND/OR search space, which
would be equivalent to solving the problem (for solution
counting or computing P (e)). But for some of the smaller
instances this is actually feasible, which gives us the option
of testing how tight our bound is.

Table 2: Comparison of bounds to exact search space size #cm.

Table 2 shows the upper bounds nk w+1 , twb, and hwb (this
time not in their log10 ), as well as the exact number of AND
nodes in the actual context-minimal search graph. The values in each row were obtained on the same minfill ordering
(not neccessarily the one used for Table 1).
For smaller instances the bound we compute turns out to
be rather tight (note that CPCS instances exhibit no determinism at all and thus twb and hwb match the size of
the search space exactly). As the problems become bigger
and their structure more complicated, however, the bound
quality deteriorates. It should be interesting to perform this
comparison on bigger problem instances, but as of now this
is limited by the resources available in current computers.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK

While asymptotic bounds for search algorithms can give a
rough idea about problem hardness, it is often desirable to
obtain a tighter, more fine-grained bound. As has previously been shown, this can be accomplished by looking at
a suitable tree decomposition of the problem’s underlying
graph structure and the domains of variables in the decomposition clusters. This, however, is blind to determinism,
which can greatly prune the search space in practice.
The contribution of this paper is to introduce ideas from the
framework of hypertree decompositions into the bounding
of the search space. This allows us to exploit determinism
in the function specification, but only if it is beneficial to
the overall complexity bound.
We demonstrated on a set of 112 belief networks and 30
weighted constraint networks that the proposed scheme is
indeed able to further improve the bound on search complexity, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. On
a subset of the instances we also showed that the bound
can indeed be very tight, although it seems to deteriorate
for bigger instances. In this respect we hope to be able to
conduct more in-depth comparisons on even bigger problem instances in the future. Note that the ability to bound,

sometimes accurately, the size of the search space in linear time is very important, especially for problem instances
which are completely unsolvable exactly.
We believe that the current version of our bounding scheme
can be further improved by incorporating some form of
propagation of information down the bucket tree. Another
path we plan to pursue is using approximate counting methods, such as sampling, to compute approximations to the
number of solutions in each cluster, which will also approximate the number of nodes. Finally, for optimization
tasks and for approximating branch-and-bound and bestfirst search algorithms we hope to accomplish further tightening of the search space using the cost function itself.
On a higher level, we plan to use the bounds we obtain to
guide the selection of static and dynamic variable orderings. We also intend to deploy our scheme for parallelizing
search algorithms over a networks of many machines (e.g.,
grids and clusters).
