Introduction

Abstract

1

The intelligent reformulation or restructuring of a be­
lief network can greatly increase the efficiency of in­
ference. However, time expended for reformulation
is not available for performing inference. Thus, un­
der time pressure, there is a tradeoff between the
time dedicated to reformulating the network and the
time applied to the implementation of a solution. We
investigate this partition of resources into time ap­
plied to reformulation and time used for inference.
We shall describe first general principles for comput­
ing the ideal partition of resources under uncertainty.
These principles have applicability to a wide variety
of problems that can be divided into interdependent
phases of problem solving. After, we shall present re­
sults of our empirical study of the problem of deter­
mining the ideal amount of time to devote to search­
ing for clusters in belief networks. In this work, we
acquired and made use of probability distributions
that characterize (1) the performance of alternative
heuristic search methods for reformulating a network
instance into a set of cliques, and (2) the time for
executing inference procedures on various belief net­
works. Given a preference model describing the value
of a solution as a function of the delay required for
its computation, the system selects an ideal time to
devote to reformulation.

For a large class of AI problem-solving techniques,
great gains in efficiency can be achieved by expend­
ing effort on a preliminary meta-analysis of a problem
instance before directly executing a solution. Belief­
network algorithms highlight the necessity of refor­
mulating or restructuring problem instances. The re­
formulation of a belief-network can greatly increase
the efficiency of inference. Indeed, many belief­
network algorithms rely on some preliminary refor­
mulation procedure. Our analysis of reformulation is
motivated by our pursuit of techniques for the dy­
namic construction and solution of belief networks
[7, 1].
To date, investigators have made use of offline
analyses for reformulating a small number of net­
works that will be solved many times. Unfortunately,
straightforward offline analyses of reformulation, may
not be effective in systems that must construct and
solve belief-network problems at run time. The com­
putational effort expended for reformulating a newly
constructed belief network is not available for the pri­
mary task of performing inference with the network.
Thus, in time-dependent decision contexts, there is a
tradeoff between the time dedicated to reformulating
the network and the time applied to the implementa­
tion of a solution.
We shall describe the metareasoning-partition
problem and present principles for computing the
ideal partition of resources under uncertainty for sev­
eral prototypical classes of uncertainty and utility. In
Section 3, we shall consider the global optimization

formulation for the situation where the reformulated
instance is solved once. In Section 4, we will discuss
the inclusion of evidence about the progress of prob­
lem solving, in a formulation of the metareasoning­
partition problem centering on a myopic optimization
policy. Following the presentation of theoretical re­
sults, we shall discuss in Section 5 an empirical study
of the application of these principles to belief net­

works. We focus, in particular, on an empirical anal­
ysis of the ideal amount of time to devote to search­
ing for clusters in belief networks. We acquire and
apply probability distributions that characterize the

I

performance of alternative heuristic search methods
for finding cliques and the time for executing infer­
ence procedures on various belief networks. Given a
preference model, describing the value of a solution

as a function of the delay needed for its computa­
tion, the system determines the ideal time to devote
to reformulation.

Brute-force approaches to the solution of belief­
network inference problems are intractable. In a
brute-force analysis, we generate a joint distribu­
tion by taking the product of all assigned distribu­
tions. Given the joint distribution, we compute the
marginal probability for any value of a variable or
Boolean combination of values, by summing over the
relevant dimensions of the joint distribution. The size
of the joint distribution is exponential in the number
of variables. Thus, although this naive approach is
conceptually simple, it requires computation that is
exponential in the number of variables.
Although the problem of probabilistic inference
with belief networks is .N"P-hard, methods have been
developed for exploiting independence relations to
avoid the explicit calculation of the joint-probability
distribution. A variety of exact methods has been
developed to operate on specific topologies of be­
lief networks [13]. Other recent methods forego exact calculation of probabilities; these approximation
techniques produce partial results as distributions or
bounds over probabilities of interest [4, 14, 8].
Several promising exact and approximate ap­
proaches rely on the reformulation of multiply con­
nected networks. We are studying the ideal control
of reformulation of belief network instances with the
clique-tree approach developed and refined in [11, 9],

nested-dissection method of Cooper [3]. The clique­

connected belief networks into a corresponding singly
connected network of cliques. A precursory reformu­
lation of a belief-network instance works to identify
cliques, defined as maximal sets of nodes that are
completely interconnected. An algorithm has been
developed to propagate evidence within this tree of
cliques, which is somewhat analogous to the prop­
agation of belief in a singly connected network of

I

variables. Alternative clique-tree reformulations are
pictured in Figure 1. For the method of condition­
ing, reformulation seeks to break loops in a multiply
connected belief network, by identifying and instan­
tiating a loop cutset. At solution time, each cutset
node must be instantiated with each possible value
(or combination of values). Each instance is solved
as a. separate singly connected belief network prob­
lem. Reformulation methods work by generating and
evaluating cutsets that minimize the number of prob­
lem instances that must be evaluated.
Identifying the best cutset and identifying the
best set of cliques are .N"P-hard problems, since in
general they require searching all sets of subsets of
the nodes in a belief network. However, we can de­

velop heuristic strategies (see for example [10]) and
flexible (or anytime) search strategies that can deliver
increasingly better reformulations as we increase the
amount of reformulation time.

For some inference procedures it may be possi­
ble to determine t e precisely, given the amount of
time spent searching for a solution. In this special
situation, we can characterize computation time in
terms of a deterministic function, te = 'R(tr) . In
this case, the selection of te fully determines the time
that the solution to the problem becomes available.

In general, we must consider the uncertainty in the

We refer to the problem of ideally apportioning re­

[6]. The ideal partition of resources depends on the
architecture of an agent, on the availability and form
of knowledge and metaknowledge about problem­
solving, and on the problem instance at hand. Most
meta-analyses for the reformulation of belief networks
center on ·a search process. Thus, we cast reformula­
tion in terms of search. Let tr be the time the rea­

soner spends on reformulating a problem instance,

lated instance to generate a final solution. Thus, the

Thus, for the deadline case, maximizing the expected

computational result is a polynomial function of the

polynomial:

the value of a computed result is 0 unless it is available

Example:

Clique Reformu­

lation
We have applied an incremental analysis of ideal par­
tition of resources to the example of clique reformu­
lation of a belief network. The fundamental cycle
is construction of a belief network, formation of the
clique tree (reformulation), and finally performing in­
ference (calculating the posterior probability of all
unobserved variables). We shall present several de­
tails about the clique identification strategies. After,
we shall describe the procedures used to collect prob­
ability distributions for use in the analysis. Finally,
we shall review the results of using these distributions
in an incremental analysis.

Clique Reformulation Methods

is generated by varying the initial conditions to pro­
duce a large number of join tree topologies. After
we generate an ordering, we determine the join tree
structure. We then estimate the time required to
solve that configuration with an efficient estimation
procedure [15]. In our study of ideal clique-tree refor­
mulation, we based this time estimate on the sum of
the state-space sizes for the cliques in the tree. These
"generate and test" procedures maintain a record of
the best clique configuration found to that time and
continues to search until the procedure is terminated.
The strategies are flexible in that they generate so­
lutions that are monotonically increasing in quality
(decreasing in te), and make available, at all times,
the best join tree found so far. As the reformulation
time, tr, is increased, the procedure searches addi­
tional join-tree configurations.

For a particular network, the benefits of additional reformulation time are uncertain because of

Applying the Techniques

The criteria of Equation 6 has been implemented in a
recent version of the IDEAL belief-network environ­
ment. Given a specification of a value function and
a belief network, the system uses empirical data to
determine, in real time, whether or not to continue
with reformulation.
We performed an investigation of the value of
metareasoning for optimizing the reformulation time.
Because an analysis of the ideal reformulation of belief networks is sensitive to the efficiencies of the soft­
ware and hardware, as well as to the formulation of
the metareasoning model, it is important to consider
details of the software and hardware. All experiments
were run with IDEAL on a Symbolics 3645 Lisp Ma­
chine with 8 megabytes of physical memory.
The following experimental procedure was un­
dertaken: A series of 30-node belief networks were
constructed by a random belief-network generator in
IDEAL. For each network and value-function pair, we
applied (1) a default policy of halting reformulation
after the first clique tree is identified by the K-search
heuristic and (2) the incremental reformulation policy
presented in Section 4, based on searching through a
series of c lique trees. After applying each technique,
we executed an inference cycle (full propagation and
marginalization of all nodes in the network), given
evidence. The total time (tr + te) was used to score
the computational value of each trial based on the
value function. This procedure was applied to a se­
ries of random belief networks for a given value func­
tion to assess the longterm performance of the default
or incremental strategy. Given the metalevel model
and the classes of probability distributions described
above, we explored the relative efficacy of the default
and incremental analyses for several value functions
and para.rneterizations of these functions. These func­
tions are shown in Figure 7.
Our analysis showed that the use of metareason­
ing to dynamically optimize the amount of time ex­
pended on reformulation frequently is more valuable
than the static policy of halting reformulation after
the first valid clique-tree is discovered. We found
that the preferred approach, in terms of higher ex­
pected value over a number of trials, depended on
the form of the value function and its specific pa­
rameters. The incremental metareasoning procedure
continue to search if the benefit of finding a better
clique formulation is high enough to justify the delay
associated with continuing another time-increment of
search. Since the K-search heuristic provides a very

of improvement in absolute terms. However when
the costs of incremental delay are substantial, as in
some of the quadratic value functions analyzed, the
benefits of an improved solution can be substantial­
even when these improvements are expected with low
probability.
For the linear and exponential forms with a slow
decay of value with time, the incremental policies
tend to behave like the default policy, as they stop
searching for better cliques immediately after the first
time increment. In these cases, the incremental pol­
icy was just marginally worse than the default policy.
For deadline models, we examined several vari­
ants by changing the severity of the deadline. We
found that both policies performed equally well un­
der a variety of deadlines, indicating that the ability
to make the deadline was more dependent on the vari­
ability in the time required to perform inference on
different networks (due to topology and state space
size) than on differences in metal eve! reasoning policy.

Summary

We described the metareasoning-partition problem
and presented principles for calculating the ideal par­
tition of resources under uncertainty for several pro­
totypical classes of uncertainty and utility. We dis­
cussed the global optimization of the apportionment
of resources for the case of a precursory reformula­
tion where the reformulated instance is solved once.
After, we introduced the incremental analyses for in­
cluding evidence gleaned from observations about the
progress of problem solving. Following the presenta-

tion of our theoretical results, we discussed empirical [8]
study of the performance of a clique-tree reformula­
tion strategy with these principles. We showed how
an incremental reasoner can reason about the value
of apportioning additional time to a search for op­
timal clusters in belief networks versus halting and
solving the current best formulation. We found that
[ 9]
the value of applying metalevel machinery to opti­
mize the partition of resources for metareasoning is
sensitive to the preference model, describing the value
of a solution as a function of the delay needed for its
computation. We hope that other investigators will
find use in the principles we described for the ideal
partition of resources for reformulation under uncer­ [ 10]
tainty. In particular, the techniques hold the promise
for helping us to optimally control the dynamic con­
struction and solution of belief networks.
