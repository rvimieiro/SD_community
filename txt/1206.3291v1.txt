Abstract
Planning can often be simplified by decomposing the task into smaller tasks arranged
hierarchically. Charlin et al. [4] recently
showed that the hierarchy discovery problem
can be framed as a non-convex optimization
problem. However, the inherent computational difficulty of solving such an optimization problem makes it hard to scale to realworld problems. In another line of research,
Toussaint et al. [18] developed a method
to solve planning problems by maximumlikelihood estimation. In this paper, we show
how the hierarchy discovery problem in partially observable domains can be tackled using a similar maximum likelihood approach.
Our technique first transforms the problem
into a dynamic Bayesian network through
which a hierarchical structure can naturally
be discovered while optimizing the policy.
Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach scales better than previous techniques based on non-convex optimization.

Introduction

Planning in partially observable domains is notoriously
difficult. However, many planning tasks naturally decompose into subtasks that may be arranged hierarchically. For instance, the design of a soccer playing
robot is often decomposed into low-level skills such as
intercepting the ball, controlling the ball, passing the
ball, etc. [16]. Similarly, prompting systems that assist
older adults with activities of daily living (e.g., handwashing [8]) can be naturally decomposed into subtasks for each step of an activity. When a decomposition or hierarchy is known a priori, several approaches
have demonstrated that planning can be simplified and
performed faster [13, 7]. However, the hierarchy is

not always known or easy to specify, and the optimal
policy may only decompose approximately. To that
effect, Charlin et al. [4] showed how a hierarchy can
be discovered automatically by formulating the planning problem as a non-convex quartically constrained
optimization problem with variables corresponding to
the parameters of the policy, including its hierarchical
structure. Unfortunately, the inherent computational
difficulty of solving this optimization problem prevents
the approach from scaling to real-world problems. Furthermore, it is not clear that automated hierarchy discovery simplifies planning since the space of policies
remains the same.
We propose an alternative approach that demonstrates
that hierarchy discovery (i) can be done efficiently
and (ii) performs a policy search with a different bias
than non-hierarchical approaches that is advantageous
when there exists good hierarchical policies. The approach combines Murphy and Paskin’s [10] factored
encoding of hierarchical structures (see also [17]) into
a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with Toussaint
et al.’s [18] maximum-likelihood estimation technique
for policy optimization. More precisely, we encode
POMDPs with hierarchical controllers into a DBN in
such a way that the policy and hierarchy parameters
are entries of some conditional probability tables. We
also consider factored policies that are more general
than hierarchical controllers. The policy and hierarchy parameters are optimized with the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm [5]. Since each iteration
of EM essentially consists of inference queries, the approach scales easily.
Sect. 2 briefly introduces partially observable Markov
decision processes, controllers and policy optimization
by maximum likelihood estimation. Sect. 3 reviews
previous work on hierarchical modeling and how to use
a dynamic Bayesian network to encode a hierarchical
structure. Sect. 4 describes our proposed approach,
which combines a dynamic Bayesian network encoding with maximum likelihood estimation to simultane-

ously optimize a hierarchy and the controller. Sect. 5
demonstrates the scalability of the proposed approach
on benchmark problems. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes
the paper and discusses future work.

Background

Throughout the paper we denote random variables by
upper case letters (e.g., X), values of random variables by their corresponding lower case letters (e.g.,
x ∈ dom(X)) and sets of values by upper case letters with math calligraphy (e.g., X = {x1 , x2 , x3 }).
We now review POMDPs (Sect. 2.1), how to represent
policies as finite state controllers (Sect. 2.2) and how
to optimize bounded controllers (Sect. 2.3).
2.1

POMDPs

Partially observable Markov decision processes
(POMDPs) provide a natural and principled framework for planning. A POMDP can be formally
defined by a tuple hS, A, O, ps , ps0 |as , po0 |s0 a , ras i
where S is the set of states s, A is the set of actions
a, O is the set of observations o, ps = Pr(S0 = s) is
the initial state distribution (a.k.a. initial belief),
ps0 |as = Pr(St+1 = s0 | At = a, St = s) is the transition
distribution, po0 |s0 a = Pr(Ot+1 = o0 | St+1 = s0 , At = a)
is the observation distribution and ras = R(At =
a, St = s) is the reward function. Throughout the
paper, it is assumed that S, A and O are finite and
discrete. The goal is to select actions to maximize
the rewards. At any point in time, the information
available to select the next action consists of the
history of past actions and observations. Hence a
policy π is defined as a mapping from histories to
actions. However, since histories grow with time,
it is common practice to summarize histories with
a fixed-length sufficient statistic such as the belief
distribution bs = Pr(S = s), which corresponds to the
state distribution (conditioned on the history of past
actions and observations). The belief distribution
b can be updated at each time step, based on the
0
action a taken and the observation
Po made according
ao0
to Bayes’ theorem: bs0 = k s bs ps0 |as po0 |s0 a (k
is a normalization constant). Policies can then be
defined as mappings from beliefs to actions (e.g.,
π(b) = a). The value V π (b) of a policy π starting
in belief b is measured byPthe discounted sum of
π
t
expected
P rewards: V (b) = t γ Ebt∗|π [rπ(bt )bt ] where
rab = s bs ras . An optimal policy π is a policy with
the highest value V ∗ for all beliefs: V ∗ (b) ≥ V π ∀π, b.
The optimal value function also satisfies

2.2

Finite State Controllers

A convenient representation for an important class of
policies consists of finite state controllers [6]. Instead
of using beliefs as sufficient statistics of histories, the
idea is to use a finite internal memory to retain relevant
bits of information from histories. Each configuration
of this memory can be thought of as a node in a finite
state controller, where nodes select actions to be executed and edges indicate how to update nodes based
on the observations received. A controller with a finite
set N of nodes n can encode a stochastic policy π with
three distributions: Pr(N0 = n) = pn (initial node distribution), Pr(At = a | Nt = n) = pa|n (action selection
distribution) and Pr(Nt+1 = n0 | Nt = n, Ot+1 = o0 ) =
pn0 |no0 (successor node distribution). Such a policy
can be executed by starting in a node n sampled from
pn , executing an action a sampled from pa|n , receiving
observation o0 , transitioning to node n0 sampled from
pn0 |no0 and so on. The value of a controller
Pcan be computed
by
solving

system:

2.3

Policy Optimization

Several techniques have been proposed to optimize
controllers of a given size, including gradient ascent [9], stochastic local search [2], bounded policy iteration [14], non-convex quadratically constrained optimization [1] and likelihood maximization [18]. We
briefly describe the last technique since we will use it
in Sect. 4.
Toussaint et al. [18] recently proposed to convert
POMDPs into equivalent dynamic Bayesian networks
(DBNs) by normalizing the rewards and to optimize
a policy by maximizing the likelihood of the normalized rewards. Let R̃ be a binary variable corresponding to normalized rewards. The reward function ras is then replaced by a reward distribution
pr̃|sat = Pr(R̃ = r̃ | At = a, St = s, T = t) that assigns probability ras /(rmax − rmin ) to R̃ = 1 and
1 − ras /(rmax − rmin ) to R̃ = 0 (rmin = minas ras
and rmax = maxas ras ). An additional time variable
T is introduced to simulate the discount factor and the
summation of rewards. Since a reward is normally discounted by a factor γ t when earned t time steps in the
future, the prior pt = Pr(T = t)P
is set to γ t (1−γ) where
∞
the factor (1−γ) ensures that t=0 pt = 1. The resulting dynamic Bayesian network is illustrated in Fig. 1.
It can be thought of as a mixture of finite processes of
length t with a 0-1 reward R̃ earned at the end of the
process. The nodes Nt encode the internal memory of
the controller. Given the controller distributions pn ,
pa|n and pn0 |no0 , it is possible to evaluate the controller

we will empirically compare our approach to the nonconvex optimization techniques used to optimize recursive controllers. In another line of research, Murphy
and Paskin [10] proposed to model hierarchical hidden
Markov models (HMMs) with a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). Theocharous et al. [17] also used DBNs
to model hierarchical POMDPs. We briefly review this
DBN encoding in Sect. 3.2 since we will use it in our
approach to model factored controllers.

by computing the likelihood of R̃ = 1. More precisely,
V π (ps ) = (Pr(R̃ = 1) − rmin )/[(rmax − rmin )(1 − γ)].
Optimizing the policy can be framed as maximizing
the likelihood of R̃ = 1 by varying the distributions
pn , pa|n and pn0 |no0 encoding the policy. Toussaint et
al. use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since EM is guaranteed to increase the likelihood at
each iteration, the controller’s value increases monotonically. However, EM is not guaranteed to converge
to a global optimum. An important advantage of the
EM algorithm is its simplicity both conceptually and
computationally. In particular, the computation consists of inference queries that can be computed using
a variety of exact and approximate algorithms.

Recursive Controllers

Hierarchical Modeling

While optimizing a bounded controller allows an effective search in the space of bounded policies, such
an approach is clearly suboptimal since the optimal
controller of many problems grows doubly exponentially with the planning horizon and may be infinite
for infinite horizons. Alternatively, hierarchical representations permit the representation of structured
policies with exponentially fewer parameters. Several
approaches were recently explored to model and learn
hierarchical structures in POMDPs. Pineau et al. [13]
sped up planning by exploiting a user specified action hierarchy. Hansen et al. [7] proposed hierarchical controllers and an alternative planning technique
that also exploits a user specified hierarchy. Charlin et
al. [4] proposed recursive controllers (which subsume
hierarchical controllers) and an approach that discovers the hierarchy while optimizing a controller. We
briefly review recursive controllers in Sect. 3.1 since

A recursive controller [4] consists of a recursive automaton with concrete nodes n and abstract nodes n̄.
Abstract nodes call a subcontroller before selecting an
action. A controller is said to be recursive when it
can call itself, essentially encoding an infinite hierarchy. Formally, a recursive controller is parametrized
by an action selection distribution for each node (e.g.,
pa|n and pa|n̄ ), a successor node distributions for each
node (e.g., pn0 |no0 and pn0 |n̄o0 ) and a child node distribution for each abstract node (e.g., pn0 |n̄ )1 . Execution of a recursive controller is performed by executing the action selected by each node visited and
continuing to the successor node selected by the observation made. However, when an abstract node is
visited, before executing the action selected, its subcontroller is called and started in the child node selected by the child node distribution. A subcontroller
returns control to its parent node when a special end
node is reached. Charlin et al. [4] show that optimizing
a recursive controller with a fixed number of concrete
and abstract nodes can be framed as a non-convex
quartically constrained optimization problem. The hierarchical structure is discovered as the controller is
optimized since the variables of the optimization problem include the child node distributions which implicitly encode the hierarchy. Three techniques based on
a general non-linear solver, a mixed-integer non-linear
approximation and a form of bounded hierarchical policy iteration are experimented with, but do not scale
beyond toy problems. Furthermore, Charlin et al. do
not demonstrate whether searching in the space of hierarchical controllers can speed up planning. Although
it is clear that planning is simplified when a hierarchy
is given a priori since the policy space is reduced, it
is not clear that hierarchy discovery is beneficial since
the policy space remains the same while the parameter space changes. In Sect. 5, we demonstrate that
hierarchy discovery can be beneficial when a simple
hierarchical policy of high value exists.

3.2

Hierarchical HMMs

Murphy and Paskin [10] proposed to model hierarchical hidden Markov models (HMMs) as dynamic
Bayesian networks (DBNs). The idea is to convert a
hierarchical HMM of L levels into a dynamic Bayesian
network of L state variables, where each variable encodes abstract states at the corresponding level. Here,
abstract states can only call sub-HMMs at the previous level. Fig. 2 illustrates a two-level hierarchical
HMMs encoded as a DBN. The state variables Stl are
indexed by the time step t and the level l. The Et variables indicate when a base-level sub-HMM has ended,
returning its control to the top level HMM. The toplevel abstract state transitions according to the top
HMM, but only when the exit variable Et indicates
that the base-level concrete state is an exit state. The
base-level concrete state transitions according to the
base-level HMM. When an exit state is reached, the
next base-level state is determined by the next toplevel abstract state. Factored HMMs subsume hierarchical HMMs in the sense that there exists an equivalent factored HMM for every hierarchical HMM. In
Sect. 4.1, we will use a similar technique to convert
hierarchical controllers into factored controllers.

Factored Controllers

We propose to combine the DBN encoding techniques
of Murphy et al. [10] and Toussaint et al. [18] to convert a POMDP with a hierarchical controller into a
mixture of DBNs. The hierarchy and the controller
are simultaneously optimized by maximizing the reward likelihood of the DBN. We also consider factored
controllers which subsume hierarchical controllers.
4.1

DBN Encoding

Fig. 3a illustrates two consecutive slices of one DBN in
the mixture (rewards are omitted) for a three-level hierarchical controller. Consider a POMDP defined by
the tuple hS, A, O, ps , ps0 |as , po0 |s0 a , ras i and a threelevel hierarchical (non-recursive) controller defined by

• base

0 otherwise
While the Etl variables help clarify when the end of
a sub-controller is reached, they are not necessary.
Eliminating them yields a simpler DBN illustrated in
Fig. 3b. The conditional probability distributions of
the Ntl variables become:
• base
p̂n00 |n0 n01 o0
 level node distribution:
pn00 |n01

• toplevel node distribution: p̂n02 |n2 o0 e1

Note that ignoring the above constraints in the conditional distributions yields a factored controller that
is more flexible than a hierarchical controller since the
conditional probability distributions of the Ntl variables do not have to follow the structure imposed by
a hierarchy

Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Following Toussaint et al.’s technique [18], we optimize
a factored controller by maximizing the reward likelihood. Since the policy parameters are conditional
probability distributions of the DBN, the EM algorithm can be used to optimize them. Computation
alternates between the E and M steps below. We denote by ntop and nbase the top and base nodes in a
given time slice. We also denote by φ(V ) and φ(v) the
parents of V and a configuration of the parents of V .

4.2.2

E-step

To speed up the computation of the inference queries
in the E-step, we compute intermediate terms using a
forward-backward procedure. Let tmax be the largest
value of T , then a simple scheme that answers each
query separately takes O(t2max ) time since there are
O(tmax ) queries and each query takes O(tmax ) time
to run over the entire network. However, since part
of the computation is duplicated in several queries,
it is possible to compute intermediate terms α and β
in O(tmax ) time from which each expectation can be
computed in constant time (w.r.t. tmax ). To simplify
notation, N and n denote all the nodes and their joint
configuration in a given time slice.

To fully take advantage of the structure of the DBN,
we first marginalize the DBN w.r.t. the observations

4.2.3

M-step

The standard M-step adjusts each parameter pv|φ(v)
by normalizing the expectations computed in the Estep, i.e., pnew
v|φ(v) ∝ Evφ(v) . To speed up convergence,
we instead use a variant that performs a soften greedy
M-step. In the greedy M-step, each parameter pnew
v|φ(v)
is greedily set to 1 when v = argmaxv̄ fv̄φ(v̄) and 0
otherwise, where fvφ(v) = Evφ(v) /pold
v|φ(v) . The greedy
M-step can be thought of as the limit of an infinite
sequence of alternating partial E-step and standard
M-step where the partial E-step keeps f fixed. The
combination of a standard M-step with this specific
partial E-step updates pv|φ(v) by a multiplicative factor
proportional to fvφ(v) . In the limit, the largest fvφ(v)
ends up giving all the probability to the corresponding pv|φ(v) . EM variants with certain types of partial
E-steps ensure monotonic improvement of the likelihood when the hidden variables are independent [11].
This is not the case here, however by softening the
greedy M-step we can still obtain monotonic improvement most of the time while speeding up convergence.
We update pv|φ(v) as follows:
v ∗ = argmax fvφ(v)

Experiments

We first compared the performance of the maximum
likelihood (ML) approach to previous optimizationbased approaches from [4]. Table 2 summarizes the results for 2-layer controllers with certain combinations
of |N base | and |N top |. The problems include paint,
shuttle and 4x4 maze (previously used in [4]) and
three additional problems: chain-of-chains (described
below), hand-washing (reduced version from [8]) and
cheese-taxi (variant from [12]). On the first three
problems, ML reaches the same values as the previous optimization-based approaches, but with larger
controllers. We attribute this to EM’s weaker ability to avoid local optima than the optimization-based
approaches. However, the optimization-based approaches run out of memory on the last three problems (memory needs exceed 2 Gb of RAM), while ML
scales gracefully (as analyzed in Sect. 4.2.4). ML approach demonstrates that hierarchy discovery can be
tackled with tractable algorithms. We also report the
values reached with a state of the art point-based value

Table 2: V ∗ denotes optimal values (with truncated trajectories) [3] except for handwashing and cheese-taxi
where we show the optimal value of the equivalent fully-observable problem. HSVI2 found a solution in less than
1s for every problem except handwashing where the algorithm was halted after 12 hours of computation. The
ML approach optimizes a factored controller for 200 EM iterations with a planning horizon of tmax = 100. (5,3)
nodes means |N base | = 5 and |N top | = 3. For cheese-taxi, we get a maximum value of 2.25. N/A indicates that
the solver did not complete successfully. All tests are done on a dual-core x64 processor @2.2GHz.

The next question is whether there are computational
savings when automatically discovering a hierarchy.
Recall that previous work has shown that policy optimization is simplified when a hierarchy is known a
priori since the space of policies is restricted. The
next experiment demonstrates that policy optimization while discovering a hierarchy can be done faster
and/or yield higher value when there exists good hierarchical policies. Table 3 compares the performance
when optimizing flat, hierarchical and factored controllers on chain-of-chains, hand-washing and cheesetaxi. Here, the factored and hierarchical controllers
have two levels and correspond respectively to the
DBNs in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b).3 The x-axis is the number of nodes for flat controllers and the product of the
number of nodes at each level for hierarchical and factored controllers. Taking the product is justified by the
fact that the equivalent flat controllers of some hierarchical/factored controllers require that many nodes.
The graphs in the right column of Table 3 demonstrate that hierarchical and factored controllers can
be optimized faster, confirming the analysis done in
Sect. 4.2.4. There is no difference in computational
complexity between the strictly hierarchical and unconstrained factored architectures. Recall however
that the efficiency gains of the hierarchical and factored controllers are obtained at the cost of a restricted
policy space. Nevertheless, the graphs in the left column of Table 3 suggest that hierarchical/factored controllers can still find equally good policies when there
exist one. Factored controllers are generally the most
robust. With a sufficient number of nodes, they find
the best policies on all three problems. Note that factored and hierarchical controllers need at least a number of nodes equal to the number of actions in the base
layer in order to represent a policy that uses all actions.

Factored controllers are hierarchical controllers where
the restrictions imposed by the Et variables are removed.

Figure 4: Hierarchical controller learnt for the chainof-chains. The diamond indicates an exit node, for
which p̂e0 |n0 = 1.

This explains why hierarchical and factored controllers
with less than 4 base nodes (for chain-of-chains) and
7 base nodes (for hand-washing and cheese-taxi) do
poorly. The optimization of flat controllers tend to get
stuck in local optima if too many nodes are used. Comparing the unconstrained factored architecture versus
hierarchical, we find that the additional constraints
in the hierarchical controller make the optimization
problem harder although there are less parameters to
optimize. As a result, EM gets stuck more often in
local optima.
We also examine whether learnt hierarchies make intuitive sense. Good policies for the cheese-taxi and handwashing problems can often be represented hierarchically, however the hierarchical policies found didn’t
match hierarchies expected by the authors. Since these
are non-trivial problems for which there may be many
ways to represent good policies in a hierarchical fashion that is not intuitive, we designed the chain-ofchains problem, which is much simpler to analyze. The
optimal policy of this problem consists of executing n
times the same chain of n actions followed by a submit
action to earn the only reward. The optimal policy requires n2 + 1 nodes for flat controllers and n + 1 nodes
at each level for hierarchical controllers. For n = 3,
ML found a hierarchical controller of 4 nodes at each
level, illustrated in Fig. 4. The controller starts in
node 0. Nodes at level 1 are abstract and descend
into concrete nodes at level 0 by following the dashed

Table 3: Left: The reached values depending on the number of nodes in the controller. For the factored
and hierarchical controller we indicate the number of nodes in both layers (e.g., (5,3) means |N base | = 5 and
|N top | = 3) and plot the data point at |N base ||N top | on the x-axis. For instance, in the case of handwashing
we see how the performance depends critically on |N base |. Right: The optimization time. In all cases, 200 EM
iterations are performed with a planning horizon of tmax = 100. The results for each controller are the average
of 10 runs with error bars of ±1 standard deviation.

edges. Control is returned to level 1 when an end node
(denoted by a diamond) is reached. Here, the optimal
policy is to do A-B-C three times followed by D. Hence
a natural hierarchy would abstract A-B-C and D into
separate subcontrollers. While the controller in Fig. 4
is not completely optimal (the vertical transition from
abstract node 0 should have probability 1 of reaching node A), it found an equivalent, but less intuitive
abstraction by having subcontrollers that do A-B-C
and D-A-B-C. This suggests that for real-world problems there will be many valid abstractions that are
not easily interpretable by humans and the odds that
an automated procedure finds an intuitive hierarchy
without any additional guidance are slim.

Conclusion

The key advantage of maximum likelihood is that it
can exploit the factored structure in a controller architecture. This facilitates hierarchy discovery when the
hierarchical structure of the controller is encoded into
a corresponding dynamic Bayesian network (DBN).
Our complexity analysis and the empirical run time
analysis confirm the favorable scaling. In particular,
we solved problems like handwashing and cheese-taxi
that could not be solved with the previous approaches
in [4]. Compared to flat controllers, factored controllers are faster to optimize and less sensitive to local
optima when they have many nodes. Our current implementation does not exploit any factored structure

in the state, action and observation space, however we
envision that a factored implementation would naturally scale to large factored POMDPs.
For the chain-of-chains problem, maximum likelihood
finds a valid hierarchy. For other problems like handwashing, there might be many hierarchies and the one
found by our algorithm is usually hard to interpret.
We cannot expect our method to find a hierarchy that
is human readable. Interestingly, although the strictly
hierarchical architectures have less parameters to optimize, they seem to be more susceptible to local optima
as compared to a factored but otherwise unconstrained
controller. Future work will investigate various heuristics to escape local optima during optimization.
In this paper we made explicit assumptions about the
structure – we prefixed the structure of the DBN to
mimic a strict hierarchy or a level-wise factorization
and we fixed the number of nodes in each level. However, the DBN framework allows us to build on existing
methods for structure learning of graphical models. A
promising extension would be to use such structure
learning techniques to optimize the factored structure
of the controller. Since the computational complexity
for evaluating (training) a single structure is reasonable, techniques like MCMC could sample and evaluate a variety of structures. This variety might also help
to circumvent local optima, which currently define the
most dominant limit of our approach.
