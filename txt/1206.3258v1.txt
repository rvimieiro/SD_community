Abstract

the help it provides and the decision to interrupt a user [15]
to account for specific user preferences.

User preferences for automated assistance often vary widely, depending on the situation, and
quality or presentation of help. Developing effective models to learn individual preferences online
requires domain models that associate observations of user behavior with their utility functions,
which in turn can be constructed using utility
elicitation techniques. However, most elicitation
methods ask for users’ predicted utilities based
on hypothetical scenarios rather than more realistic experienced utilities. This is especially true
in interface customization, where users are asked
to assess novel interface designs. We propose
experiential utility elicitation methods for customization and compare these to predictive methods. As experienced utilities have been argued to
better reflect true preferences in behavioral decision making, the purpose here is to investigate
accurate and efficient procedures that are suitable
for software domains. Unlike conventional elicitation, our results indicate that an experiential
approach helps people understand stochastic outcomes, as well as better appreciate the sequential
utility of intelligent assistance.

In this paper, we focus on interface customization where
the attributes of interface widgets (e.g., location, transparency, and functionality) are automatically tailored to the
needs of specific users. In particular, we are interested
in intelligent systems that learn to predict user goals over
time based on observed user behavior, and suggest ways
(e.g., through interface customization) to help the user
complete the desired goal. Considerable work has been devoted to the prediction of user needs and goals (e.g., [16;
1; 28; 3] among others), much of it is focused on developing probabilistic models of user goals. Less emphasis
has been placed on assessing user preferences for software
interaction and customization (for exceptions, see [11;
17]). However, accounting for user preferences is critical to good interface customization. For instance, consider
automated word completion [10]. Some users may prefer single-word suggestions, while others may prefer several different suggestions. Similarly, some users may be
satisfied with “partial help” (e.g., a partially correct word
that saves a few keystrokes) while others may wish to use
only completely correct completions. These preferences,
and more importantly, a user’s strength of preference, are
needed to make suggestion decisions: preferences must be
weighed against the probability of specific user goals.

1 Introduction
Intelligent software customization has become increasingly
important as users are faced with larger, more complex applications. For a variety of reasons, software must be tailored to specific individuals and circumstances [21]. For
example, adaptive interfaces are critical as different users
may: require different functionality from multi-purpose
software [5]; prefer different modes of interaction; use software on a variety of hardware devices [12]; or, due to
expanding software complexity, require online and automated help to identify and master different software functions [16]. In the latter case, a system should ideally adapt

In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of
preference elicitation techniques for interface customization. While elicitation may not be used directly (i.e., online) during application use, most adaptive systems will
make indirect assessments of user preferences (e.g., [32;
30; 8; 19]). However, even indirect assessment methods
require some knowledge of the range of possible user preferences and how those are (perhaps stochastically) related
to observable behavior. In these cases, offline preference
elicitation for different customizations can provide valuable data for the design of an online system.
Most existing literature on preference elicitation in AI, as
well as the majority of that in behavioral decision theory, assumes that people “know” their preferences a pri-

ori. However, often users have not encountered, nor even
considered, the hypothetical situations typically posed in
the elicitation process. This is especially true of software
customization, since the situations involve novel interfaces.
Under these circumstances, people may report their predicted utilities by conceptualizing the posed scenarios and
forecasting their own preferences. However, what people
“think they like” can systematically differ from what they
“actually like” [23]. For example, someone who has not
actually engaged in a system that offers a range of partial
word completion suggestions may predict that they dislike
the interface in a particular circumstance, but in fact like it
when they experience it (or vice versa).
For this reason, we propose a novel experiential elicitation approach for interface customization. Our elicitation
“queries” allow users to assess experienced utilities [25] by
providing simple, hands-on tasks and system suggestions
or customizations, drawn from a particular distribution. We
adapt standard elicitation approaches to incorporate such
experiential queries. Our approach also overcomes some of
the difficulties with well-established procedures (e.g., standard gambles) that involve probabilities over a distribution
of outcomes. We explore this new approach in the context
of a specific customization task—the suggestion of highlighting options in PowerPoint — and show that experiential elicitation offers a more accurate means of assessing
quantitative tradeoffs in preferences. Unfortunately, one
drawback of experiential queries is the time they take. To
counteract this, we also propose two hybrid models that attempt to assess experienced utilities somewhat more (time)
efficiently. Our results show that one hybrid procedure provides a good approximation to the experiential approach in
a much more effective manner.
In Section 2, we outline the basic customization domain,
and describe the underlying decision-theoretic model used
to provide assistance to users. We describe essential background on preference elicitation in Section 3. Our approach
to experiential elicitation for interface customization is presented in Section 4, as is our empirical evaluation. In Section 5 we consider two hybrid approaches that accelerate
the experiential process, primed and primed+ elicitation,
and evaluate their effectiveness. The key benefit in our experiential approach is that it enables users to better interpret
queries and assess the sequential utility of an interface via
hands-on experience. As a result, our approach can provide
a more accurate picture of the user’s preferences.

2 The Customization Domain
We are interested in developing intelligent systems that perform online interface customization based on user preferences and user needs. We focus on a concrete form of
customization as an example to illustrate our approach, but
note that the general principles apply more broadly. We use

task implemented as part of PowerPoint 2003.

this domain and application to motivate the need for preference elicitation for interface customization and to highlight
the difficulties with standard elicitation methods. Our main
contributions are discussed in Sections 4 and 5, but will
apply more broadly than the task considered here.

2.1 The Highlighting Task
Consider a user authoring slides in PowerPoint who wishes
to highlight important phrases and new terminology by applying a particular font stylization. For aesthetic reasons,
the user tends to choose from just a few highlighting styles
that are consistent throughout a presentation, and possibly
across multiple presentations. This consistency provides
the opportunity for an intelligent system to observe and
learn user-specific patterns, so that it can offer useful suggestions in the future. Figure 1 shows an example toolbar with 10 icons, each suggesting a particular set of font
characteristics that can be applied to highlight the selected
phrase “patient.” Many repetitive tasks in PowerPoint and
other software can benefit from automated suggestions designed to minimize user effort.
We assume that in a highlighting task, the user has a certain style in mind, which involves changing some number
of font features to make it stand out from the rest of the
text. We define the complexity of a highlighting style as the
number of font feature values required to create it. In other
words, this is the number of events that the user must execute to make a phrase different from neighboring text or
some baseline default font style. For example, relative to
“plain” black text, a bold, italicized font has complexity 2.
To assist the user with the highlighting task, our system
can suggest a toolbar with a number of icons, each offering
some combination of font features shown by the characters “Aa” (as illustrated in Figure 1). The user may: select one of these icons to apply the associated font style;
complete the highlighting task purely manually using the
mouse (e.g., click on the Bold icon) or shortcut keys (e.g.,
press Ctrl-B); or accept a suggestion, but further refine it
manually by applying (or undoing) additional font characteristics. If the toolbar is ignored (e.g., the user continues
typing), it disappears after a short time.

2.2 Predictive Model & Assistance Decisions
Intuitively, the value of highlighting suggestion depends on
the amount of savings it offers relative to manual task completion. There are also costs to suggestions: interruption,
processing costs, mode switching, etc. We discuss the relative value and costs of a set of toolbar suggestions below.
Notice, however, that the value of a suggestion cannot be
known with certainty: the system can only make a stochastic prediction about the user’s true intended goal. These
predictions must be weighed against the overall costs and
benefits of making (or not making) a suggestion.
While our aim is not to discuss predictive models, we give a
sketch of our system model in order to place our elicitation
results in the appropriate context. We focus specifically on
highlighting goals in which the user desires a certain style
(combination of font attributes). The system observes past
user events and learns user-specific styles, which are stored
in a goal library. For each goal, the system creates a probabilistic event model (a stochastic automaton), and at runtime maintains a distribution over goals given the stream
of observed user events. Suggestions are made (or not)
decision-theoretically using a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) [2] to tradeoff goal probabilities with the costs and benefits of various suggestions [19]
given specific user preferences. We elaborate on the cost
model in Section 2.3, as well as how user preferences can
be incorporated into a POMDP in Section 3.
2.3 The Value and Costs of Suggestions
By selecting one of the suggested icons, the user saves the
effort of manually completing the task herself (or some
part of the task). Savings is an objective measure of help
quality, reflecting the number of steps/actions a user avoids
by accepting a suggestion. Common examples that provide savings are auto-completion and the Office 2007 minitoolbar. Research in human-computer interaction (HCI)
suggests that the manual effort of interaction (e.g., moving the mouse, typing, mode switching) is a function of the
user’s actions, the number of such actions, and the modes
used to execute them [6]. The quality of help actions in
adaptive systems can be defined similarly, capturing the
difference between manual effort required by the user with
and without help. We define the quality Q(i|g) of a suggestion icon i (given a goal g) to be this difference. Since
we expect users to pick the best icon available, we define
the quality of toolbar t to be Q(t|g) = maxi∈t Q(i|g), the
maximum effort saved by any icon in the toolbar.1
The subjective value of help may vary depending on certain user features, such as neediness and distractibility [16;
19], frustration/distress [26; 9; 19], and independence [19].
1

Of course, since the goal is only known stochastically, expected quality must be computed relative to the system’s beliefs
about the user’s current highlighting goal.

In other words, quality of the suggestion alone may not
predict system utility. For example, someone who currently needs help with a difficult task may benefit greatly
from partial suggestions that help the user identify the next
steps, while someone who is highly independent may not
even accept (or find value in) suggestions of perfect quality. In other words, the perceived utility of automated help
is a function of certain user characteristics, such as how
much help the user needs or how independent the user is.
In a probabilistic model, these characteristics are hidden
user variables that need to be estimated online based on sequences of observed user behavior. In our initial design,
we focus on neediness only. Examples of observable characteristics that a system can use to infer the user’s neediness level include the user being stuck (i.e., pausing during
task activity) or looking for help (i.e., browsing without selection).2 These observations often arise in difficult tasks.
Therefore, we define the user’s level of neediness N (g) as
a function of how difficult the goal g is to the user. (We
explain how we simulate user neediness in a controlled experiment in Section 4.2.)
Apart from potential savings, toolbar suggestions also have
associated costs. In general, information processing refers
to the user scanning and evaluating a set of items of similar
nature. Common interface examples that require information processing are menus and toolbars. Research in HCI
suggests that the time it takes a user to process a set of
items in an interface is a function of the number of items
and the search strategy used based on the expertise level of
the user [13; 22; 14]. In adaptive toolbars, the icons are always changing, so users cannot develop a search strategy to
minimize processing time. To model processing time, we
focus only on the number of items in an adaptive toolbar.
We define length L(t) to be the number of icons in t.
Depending on the specific system action, costs other than
information processing may be relevant in determining system utility. We refer interested readers to [20] for a detailed
discussion of interaction cost models.

3 Preference Elicitation
In order for the system to choose a good toolbar to help the
user, it needs a model of the user’s preferences for possible suggestions. The value of a suggestion t depends on
the user’s utility function with respect to user neediness N ,
toolbar length L, and suggestion quality Q. Let O be the
set of possible outcomes over the values of these three attributes. We use notation such as n1, l5, q4 to represent the
outcome with the user’s neediness level at 1 (high) and the
toolbar showing five icons with toolbar quality 4. The need
for a utility function (rather than qualitative preferences)
should be apparent given the stochastic nature of goal estimation.
2

Bayesian models exist for learning neediness [16; 19].

A user’s preferences for particular outcomes, including
their strength of preference, can be represented by a utility function, u : O → , where u(oi ) > u(oj ) iff oi is
preferred to oj , and u(oi ) = u(oj ) iff the user is indifferent between oi and oj . For convenience, we normalize
utilities to the interval [0, 1], defining o⊤ to be the best outcome with u(o⊤ ) = 1 and o⊥ to be the worst outcome with
u(o⊥ ) = 0. A utility function can be viewed as reflecting qualitative preferences over lotteries (distributions over
outcomes) [27], with one lottery preferred to another iff its
expected utility is greater. Let SG(p) = hp, o⊤ ;1-p, o⊥ i
denote a standard gamble, a specific (parameterized) lottery where o⊤ is realized with probability p and o⊥ is realized with probability 1 − p. The expected utility of this
lottery is p.

R

The standard gamble query (SGQ) for outcome oi asks the
user to state the probability p for which she would be indifferent between SG(p) and outcome oi [27]. This type of
query is extremely informative as it asks the user to assess
a precise tradeoff involving oi , and indeed fixes u(oi ) on
the normalized scale. However, this makes such queries
practically impossible to answer with confidence. More
cognitively plausible are bound queries. The bound query
B(oi , p) asks the user whether she would prefer SG(p)
to oi . A positive response places an upper bound of p
on u(oi ), while a negative response places a similar lower
bound. Their yes/no nature makes bound queries easier for
people to answer. In principle, bound queries can be used
to incrementally elicit utility functions to any required degree of precision by incrementally refining the bounds on
utility outcomes, at each stage giving rise to a more refined
set of feasible utility functions (those consistent with the
bounds). In practice, as the feasible regions for each parameter become small, the queries will generally become
harder to answer with confidence.
In practice, a lottery is presented as textual (or verbal) description of two outcomes and their probabilities, possibly
accompanied by visual aids representing the outcomes. We
refer to this delivery of bound query as a conceptual query,
since people are asked to think about the two alternatives
before making a decision. During conceptual elicitation in
our domain, each query involves asking the user to think
about the two options by imagining the use of two separate
systems to complete the highlighting task. SG(p) corresponds to using an adaptive system repeatedly, with percentage p of the instances involving the best interface o⊤
and the rest o⊥ . Option oi corresponds to using a static
system repeatedly.
Though theoretically appealing, people often have difficulty assessing the probability parameter in SGQs [27].
Similarly, bound queries with precise probabilities can be
hard to conceptualize in this domain, with people having
difficulty comparing interface “lotteries” with a fixed outcome. Finally, a user’s assessment of what they like in hy-

pothetical settings can differ systematically from what they
actually like [25; 23; 24; 18]. For these reasons, we investigate alternative elicitation mechanisms that overcome these
difficulties.
Preference elicitation in interface customization has typically adopted a qualitative approach to assessing user preferences that learns preference rankings without learning
the strength of those preferences [29; 31; 11] (although
Horvitz et al. [17] uses “willingness to pay” to quantify
the cost of interruption). However, given the stochastic nature of goal estimation, we require estimates of utility as
discussed above. To do this within our POMDP, we require some means of associating observed user behavior
with utility functions. While direct online elicitation is not
(completely) feasible, offline elicitation can be used to develop the required models. For instance, utility functions
elicited offline can be clustered into a small set of user
types [7], which the POMDP assesses online. Online assessment of user types may be done passively [19] or explicitly through active elicitation [4]. In this context, we
propose to use an experiential elicitation procedure to carry
out offline elicitation experiments with real users, which we
describe in the next section.

4 Experiential Elicitation
To facilitate interpretation of bound queries, we develop an
experiential version of bound queries which allows the user
to “experience” both query options (including the stochastic one) before stating a preference. The user is asked to
complete k simple tasks using the system in each of two
ways: the SG(p) option shows o⊤ in fraction p of the k
tasks and o⊥ in the remaining tasks (in random order). In
this way, the user “experiences” a stochastic mixture of interfaces. The deterministic option also requires k task completions, but all using the same interface oi . After each option, the user is asked to reflect on what she liked and disliked about the experience — which could be a function of
the effort required by the tasks, toolbar “processing” cost,
the satisfaction in having toolbar help available, or the ease
of interaction — and to indicate her preference. The response provides a bound at p for oi .
4.1 Experiential Elicitation for Interfaces
We elicit U (N, L, Q) from users using the interface shown
in Figure 1. We use k = 10 tasks for each alternative
in the query, so each query involves the user completing
20 highlighting tasks. To reduce the cognitive burden and
experiment time, we elicit only U (N, L, Q) for the values Q ∈ {0, 2, 4}, L ∈ {1, 5, 10}, and N ∈ {0, 1}.
This discretization yields a range of 18 outcomes. Similarly, we discretize query probabilities: [0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0].
We define o⊤ = n0, l1, q4, since the user is at a low
level of neediness and receives the best help possible, and

o⊥ = n1, l10, q0, since the user is at a high level of neediness and receives the worst help possible.

Utility

When the system suggests a toolbar, the user can select one
icon or ignore it altogether. If the wrong font style is chosen, or the suggestion is ignored, the user must carry out
the highlighting task manually. Each task requires the user
to carry out several separate actions, and applying an incorrect style requires additional fixes.

4.2 Conceptual vs. Experiential Elicitation
We compared experiential and conceptual queries experimentally to investigate their impact on elicitation based on
several criteria: the efficiency (duration) of the procedure;
the cognitive demand imposed on users; the interpretability
or understandability of queries by the user; and the quality of the elicited responses. In particular, we compare the
elicited utilities quantitatively under these two conditions,
and test whether mean utilities elicited under conceptual
elicitation are the same as those under experiential elicitation (our null hypothesis, H0 ). We also examine the general structure of U (N, L, Q) to see if users perceive value
in such simple help, and if any trends across the user population exist in the underlying preferences.
In addition to verbal descriptions, we used screenshots to
represent each outcome in the Conceptual condition. Thirteen people participated in the Conceptual condition and 8
people in the Experiential condition.
To control for the user’s highlighting goal, we define a
target font style in each task. As illustrated in Figure 1,
each PowerPoint slide has two sentences with the same
words, where the top sentence indicates the phrase highlighted with the target font style. The user must match the
first sentence by changing the font style of the appropriate
words in the second. The vocabulary of target font styles
is defined by 7 features—5 of which are binary (bold, underline, italics, shadow, size increment) and 2 of which are
multi-valued (8 colors and 10 font families). All target font
styles in the experiment have complexity 4. Therefore, if
the system’s suggestion is perfect, it can save the user from
manually executing (sequences of) 4 separate events.
Recall that neediness is a hidden user variable, and how
much help a user needs is a function of how difficult the
user’s goal is to accomplish. In the experiment, we simulate
two neediness settings by controlling the task environment,
and thus, making the user goal more difficult to achieve. To
simulate a needy user (n1), we make the task more difficult
by restricting the set of colors to 7 shades of red and the set
of font families to 4 similar fonts. In this way, the system’s
feature vocabulary, the target font styles in the highlighting
tasks, and the icons in the toolbar are restricted to similar
colors and fonts. The interface in Figure 1 shows an example of this neediness setting. The full default feature vo-

cabulary defines the interface environment for a user who
is not needy (n0).
During the elicitation, we posed bound queries and incrementally refined the bounds by choosing p to be the midpoint of the set of feasible utility functions until all the
outcomes have feasible regions with range ≤ 0.1. Figure 2 illustrates sample results from a specific elicitation
run, showing a partial utility function (for fixed values of
N and L) for three users. The elicited bounds are drawn
as error bars (note that discretization prevents us from pinning down the utility function precisely). The “blue” user
(lower line), for instance, has 0 ≤ u(n0, l10, q0) ≤ 0.1.
The bound at q4 for the blue user is tight because she is
indifferent between SG(.8) and oi = n0, l10, q4.
Methodological Comparison On average, each experiment took 30 minutes in the Conceptual condition and 2
hours (divided into two sessions) in the Experiential condition. Experiments in the Experiential condition are much
longer because experiential queries require users to carry
out tasks, while the conceptual queries only require users
to think about scenarios.3
Since experiential queries require a series of task completions, users became tired early on and found it necessary to
take breaks in order to not be confused with the various options and associated experiences. Users in the Conceptual
condition did not seem tired during the procedure, but they
were at times inconsistent with previous responses.
Although experiential queries took longer, they provided
hands-on experience and therefore required little verbal explanation. In contrast, conceptual queries were often diffi3

Our aim is to engage in complete utility elicitation (to the
prescribed accuracy) to develop models of (classes of) user preferences that can be used in online assessment (e.g., within a
POMDP). For this reason, we do not consider means to “intelligently” assess only the relevant preferences, using, say, value of
information with respect to a specific task, something which is vital in online assessment. Of course, if general domain constraints
are known to render various outcomes impossible, we could prune
the elicitation task somewhat.

cult to explain, because they require users to first understand the aspects of the interface (e.g., amount of effort
needed in manually completing the tasks, controlled quality of help in the suggestions), then compare the costs and
benefits of a mixture of interfaces with a definitive interface, and finally, imagine using the respective interfaces in
a repeated scenario.
Structural Comparison Independently of the elicitation method, we are interested in the perceived value of
this adaptive form of customization. The utility functions
across the 21 users varied widely—some are convex, some
are concave, some are linear, some are “flat” when quality is not perfect, and some are “flat” when length is not
one. Some examples (using midpoints of feasible regions)
are shown in Figure 3. Clearly, user preferences vary
widely, even for such simple highlighting help with three
customization attributes.
In general, the utility functions are monotonically nondecreasing in Q when N and L are fixed, and monotonically non-increasing in L when N and Q are fixed. In
particular, when help quality is high (q4), utility decreases
slightly as L increases. This is expected as users perceive
higher processing costs with more icons. We also see that
partial help (q2) with L at l1 is qualitatively different than
l5 or l10, because more icons decrease the chance of the
user identifying the single icon that provides partial help.
When help quality is low (q0), some users prefer to see
one bad suggestion (l1) than many bad suggestions (l10).
There are no general trends in utility given neediness; some
users showed clear differences between the needy (n1) and
not needy (n0) scenarios, while others viewed them the
same. From this, we see that users perceive value in automated help, even in simple tasks such as highlighting. Of
course, more data is needed to draw definitive conclusions
about possible parametric forms for utilities that could further simplify online assessment.
Quantitative Comparison

Using Hotelling’s T 2 statis-

tic,4 we found that the mean utilities in the two conditions
are significantly different, p < 0.01. Thus, we reject H0 .
To provide a more detailed comparison, we carried out a
two-tailed t-test with independent means for each outcome.
The resulting t scores5 are plotted in Figure 4. Only one
outcome, n0, l1, q0, is individually significantly different
between the two conditions (with 19 degrees of freedom,
a t score of at least ±2.093 is needed for significance at
p < .05).
More interestingly, Figure 4 shows that the mean t score
tends to be higher for most outcomes in the Experiential
condition, including outcomes that provide partial quality
help (q2) and incorrect suggestions (l5, q0 and l1, q0). This
indicates that users in the Experiential condition perceive
greater value in adaptive help than users in the Conceptual condition. The Experiential condition requires users
to carry out 20 tasks for each query, while the Conceptual condition only asked users to “think about” the tasks.
With conceptual queries, we believe that participants are
less likely to truly perceive the value of automated help
in repeated scenarios, and thus, underestimate the utility
of these outcomes. We believe that experientially assessed
utilities more accurately reflect the users’ true preferences;
however, our experimental set up does not allow us to draw
such a definitive conclusion.

5 Ways to Improve the Experiential
Elicitation Procedure
Although it seems that experiential queries enable users
to report more realistic preferences, the procedure is time
consuming (even with simple utility functions over 18 out4
The T 2 distribution is a multivariate analog of the Student’s
t-distribution. We used the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in computing T 2 .
5
A t score is a measure of how far apart the two sample means
are on a distribution of differences between means.

Similar to the previous experiment, we want to test whether
the mean utilities elicited under the Conceptual condition are the same as those elicited under the Primed and
Primed+ conditions (our null hypothesis H0 ). A total of 9
and 8 people participated in the Primed and Primed+ conditions respectively.
Methodological Comparison Both procedures were
easier to administer than the experiential and conceptual
ones. First, the familiarity acquired in the training session
reduced the need to explain the interface to the users. On
average, each experiment took 30 minutes in the Primed
condition and 60 minutes in the Primed+ condition. Neither conditions seemed tiring for users. Second, users in
both conditions found the queries easier to understand than
users in the Conceptual condition. Finally, users in the
Primed+ condition were able to use their experiential query
responses as a reference for future responses. These initial
experiential queries provided users with a quick feeling for
the sequential costs and benefits of using the toolbar.
Quantitative Comparison We conducted a pairwise
analysis between the mean utilities in the Conceptual and
Primed conditions, and between those in the Conceptual
and Primed+ conditions. Using Hotelling’s T 2 statistic, we
found that the mean utilities between Primed/Primed+ and
Conceptual conditions are significantly different (p < 0.01
and p < 0.05 respectively). Thus, we reject H0 in both
instances. The results of a pairwise analysis using a twotailed t-test with independent means for each outcome are
shown in Figure 5. None of the outcomes individually are
significantly different between the new conditions and the
Conceptual condition.
From Figure 5, we see that the primed means are generally lower (t score less than 0) than conceptual. In fact, the
t scores for the Primed condition (vs. Conceptual) are always lower than the t scores for Experiential (vs. Conceptual). One explanation for this is the fact that the training
session in the Primed setting gave users a quick estimate of
the costs of searching through and evaluating suggestions

comes). Though our intent is to examine methods for offline elicitation to support models for online adaptation—
thus we do not face the demands on online customization
here—even for offline model development this procedure
may be too demanding. We develop two more efficient
elicitation procedures, based on the findings in Section 4.2.
Following the same experimental set up, we introduce two
procedures, primed and primed+, that attempt to elicit experienced utility more effectively. The Primed condition
uses a training session to familiarize users with the interface and the attributes N, L, Q; but the elicitation procedure itself still relies on conceptual queries only. The
Primed+ condition uses this training session plus 5 experiential queries at the start of the elicitation. The remaining
elicitation is done using conceptual queries only.

in the toolbar—a cost that would otherwise be “unknown”
in the Conceptual condition—but that the short experience
was insufficient to provide the user with a sense of the benefits of help. In both the Primed and Conceptual conditions, the cognitive demand involved in repeated highlighting tasks and the value of help is consistently underestimated. In contrast, the Primed+ condition and its five experiential queries provide a sense of long-term benefits of
using the toolbar. Indeed, in Figure 5, the general pattern
indicates that Primed+ approaches Experiential. These results support our initial hypothesis that experiential queries
enable the user to perceive the full value of adaptive help
under realistic circumstances.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
Traditional approaches to utility elicitation do not seem to
be effective in assessing the preferences of users for interface customization and adaptive help design, largely due
to the lack of experiential assessment. We have proposed
a new experiential elicitation procedure that is well-suited
to this and related tasks. Our results show that experiential elicitation has several benefits, including: ease of administration from the researcher’s perspective; understanding of outcomes from the user’s perspective; and helping
users appreciate the sequential nature of interaction, often
overlooked in traditional, “conceptual” elicitation. We also
developed the primed+ procedure to speed up experiential
elicitation while maintaining most of its benefits.
In this paper, we focused on eliciting a utility function with
three attributes that model savings and processing cost in
the context of interface customization. In general, a user’s
utility function may involve other attributes, depending on
the possible customization actions. For example, an adaptive system that hides unused functions causes disruption
to the user’s mental model of the application, but reduces
interface bloat. By adopting the methodology illustrated
in this work, analogous experiments can be devised to ex-

perientially elicit user preferences over these attributes for
interface customization.
Future plans include gathering more data to potentially
learn a parametric form for the utility function U (N, L, Q).
Intuitively, our results suggest a quadratic functional form
may explain most preferences, but more data is needed to
draw definitive conclusions. We are also interested in examining the extent to which a utility function of this form
can be applied more generally to different customization
and help tasks. This would allow for the learning of individual user utility models that apply to multiple tasks and
even multiple applications. Finally, we are interested in the
extent to which lessons in offline elicitation influence the
development of online active elicitation and utility assessment strategies, especially the development of behavioral
and query response models (e.g., for a POMDP).
Further development of experiential elicitation will require
better understanding of which aspects of the outcomes
make them experientially different (either better or worse)
from a user’s conceptual prediction. For example, Figure 4
indicates that, on average, the outcome n1, l10, q4 is actually not as good as people think after experiencing it. One
explanation is that users did not expect much difficulty in
searching for a matching icon (q4) when neediness is high.
When compared to the mean utility of n0, l10, q4, we see
that users underestimate the value of help when they are
needy. We believe more interesting patterns will unfold in
richer domains (i.e., with more attributes and outcomes)
and with more data.
