Abstract
Belief Propagation (BP) is one of the most
popular methods for inference in probabilistic graphical models. BP is guaranteed to
return the correct answer for tree structures,
but can be incorrect or non-convergent for
loopy graphical models. Recently, several
new approximate inference algorithms based
on cavity distribution have been proposed.
These methods can account for the effect of
loops by incorporating the dependency between BP messages. Alternatively, regionbased approximations (that lead to methods
such as Generalized Belief Propagation) improve upon BP by considering interactions
within small clusters of variables, thus taking small loops within these clusters into account. This paper introduces an approach,
Generalized Loop Correction (GLC), that
benefits from both of these types of loop correction. We show how GLC relates to these
two families of inference methods, then provide empirical evidence that GLC works effectively in general, and can be significantly
more accurate than both correction schemes.

1. Introduction
Many real-world applications require probabilistic inference from some known probabilistic model (Koller
& Friedman, 2009). This paper will use probabilistic
graphical models, focusing on factor graphs (Kschischang et al., 1998), that can represent both Markov
Networks and Bayesian Networks. The basic challenge of such inference is marginalization (or maxmarginalization) over a large number of variables. For
discrete variables, computing the exact solutions is

NP-hard, typically involving a computation that is exponential in the number of variables.
When the conditional dependencies of the variables
form a tree structure (i.e., no loops), this exact inference is tractable, and can be done by a message passing procedure, Belief Propagation (BP) (Pearl, 1988).
The Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) system applies
BP repeatedly to graph structures that are not trees
(called “loopy graphs”); however, this provides only an
approximately correct solution (when it converges).
LBP is related to the Bethe approximation to free
energy (Heskes, 2003), which is the basis for minimization of more sophisticated energy approximations and provably convergent methods (Yedidia et al.,
2005; Heskes, 2006; Yuille, 2002). A representative
class of energy approximations is the region-graph
methods (Yedidia et al., 2005), which deal with a
set of connected variables (called “regions”); these
methods subsume both the Cluster Variation Method
(CVM) (Pelizzola, 2005; Kikuchi, 1951) and the Junction Graph Method (Aji & McEliece, 2001). Such
region-based methods deal with the short loops of the
graph by incorporating them into overlapping regions
(see Figure 1(a)), and perform exact inference over
each region. Note a valid region-based methods is exact if its region graph has no loops.
A different class of algorithms, loop correction methods, tackles the problem of inference in loopy graphical
models by considering the cavity distribution of variables. A cavity distribution is defined as the marginal
distribution on Markov blanket of a single (or a cluster
of) variable(s), after removing all factors that depend
on those initial variables. Figure 1(b) illustrates cavity distribution, and also shows that the cavity variables can interact. The key observation in these methods is that, by removing a variable xi in a graphical
model, we break all the loops that involve the variable xi , resulting in a simplified problem of finding

Figure 1. Part of a factor graph, where circles are variables (circle labeled “i” corresponding to variable “xi ”) and squares
(with CAPITAL letters) represent factors. Note variables {xi , xk , xs } form a loop, as do {xk , xu , xt }, etc.
(a) An example of absorbing short loops into overlapping regions. Here, a region includes factors around each hexagon
and all its variables. Factor I and the variables xi , xj , xk appear in the three regions r1 , r2 , r3 . (Figure just shows index
α for region rα .) Region-based methods provide a way to perform inference on overlapping regions. (In general, regions
do not have to involve exactly 3 variables and 3 factors.)
(b) Cavity variables for xs are {xw , xj , xk , xu , xv }, shown using dotted circles. We define the cavity distribution
for xs by removing all the factors around this variable, and marginalizing the remaining factor-graph on dotted circles.
Even after removing factors {T, Y, W }, the variables xv , xw , and xj , xk , xu still have higher-order interactions caused by
remaining factors, due to loops in the factor graph.
(c) Cavity region r1 = {j, s, k} includes variables shown in pale circles. Variables in dotted circles are the perimeter r1 .
Removing the “pale factors” and marginalizing the rest of network on r1 , gives the cavity distribution for r1 .

the cavity distribution. The marginals around xi can
then be recovered by considering the cavity distribution and its interaction with xi . This is the basis for
the loop correction schemes by Montanari & Rizzo’s
(2005) on pairwise dependencies over binary variables,
and also Mooij & Kappen’s (2007) extension to general
factor graphs – called Loop Corrected Belief Propagation (LCBP).
This paper defines a new algorithm for probabilistic
inference, called Generalized Loop Correction (GLC),
that uses a more general form of cavity distribution,
defined over regions, and also a novel message passing
scheme between these regions that uses cavity distributions to correct the types of loops that result from
exact inference over each region. GLC’s combination of loop corrections is well motivated, as regionbased methods can deal effectively with short loops in
the graph, and the approximate cavity distribution is
known to produce superior results when dealing with
long influencial loops (Mooij & Kappen, 2007).
In its simplest form, GLC produces update equations
similar to LCBP’s; indeed, under a mild assumption,
GLC reduces to LCBP for pairwise factors. In its general form, when not provided with information on cavity variable interactions, GLC produces results similar
to region-based methods. We theoretically establish
the relation between GLC and region-based approxi-

mations, for a limited setting.
Section 2 explains the notation, factor graph representation and preliminaries for GLC. Section 3 introduces
a simple version of GLC that works with regions that
partition the set of variables; followed by its extension to the more general algorithm. Section 4 presents
empirical results, comparing our GLC against other
approaches.

2. Framework
2.1. Notation
Let X = {X1 , X2 , . . . , XN } be a set of N discretevalued random variables, where Xi ∈ Xi . Suppose
their joint probability distribution factorizes into a
product of non-negative functions:
1 Y
P (X = x) :=
ψI (xI )
Z
I∈F

where each I ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , N } is a subset of the variable indices, and xI = {xi | i ∈ I} is the set of
values
Q in x indexed by the subset I. Each factor
ψI : i∈I Xi → [0, ∞) is a non-negative function, and
F is the collection of indexing subsets I for all the
factors ψI . Below we will use the term “factor” interchangeably with the function ψI and subset I, and the
term “variable” interchangeably for the value xi and
index i. Here Z is the partition function.

A Generalized Loop Correction Method

This model can be conveniently represented as a bipartite graph, called the factor graph (Kschischang et al.,
1998), which includes two sets of nodes: variable nodes
xi , and factor nodes ψI . A variable node xi is connected to a factor node ψI if and only if i ∈ I. We
use the notation N (i) to denote the neighbors of variable xi in the factor graph – i.e., the set of factors
defined by N (i) := {I ∈ F | i ∈ I}. To illustrate,
using Figure 1(a): N (j) = {I, T, S} and T = {j, s, w}.
Q
We use the shorthand ψA (x) :=
I∈A (xI ) to denote the product of factors in a set of factors A. For
marginalizing all possible values of x except the ith
variable,
notation:
X we define theX
f (x) :=
f (x).

for a set of variables r, we use the notation

marginalization of all variables apart

Here the summation is over all variables but the ones
indexed by r.
In Figure 1(c), this is the distribution obtained by removing factors N (r1 ) = {I, T, Y, K, S, W } from the
factor gaph and marginalizing the rest over dotted circles, r1 .
The core idea to our approach is that each cavity region r can produce reliable probability distribution
over r, given an accurate cavity distribution estimate
over the surrounding variables r. Given the exact
cavity distribution P \r over r, we can recover the
exact joint distribution Pr over ⊕r by:
Y
Pr (x⊕r ) ∝ P \r (x r )ψN (r) (x) = P \r (x r )
ψI (xI ) .

2.2. Generalized Cavity Distribution
The notion of cavity distribution is borrowed from socalled cavity methods from statistical physics (Mézard
& Montanari, 2009), and has been used in analysis
and optimization of important combinatorial problems (Mézard et al., 2002; Braunstein et al., 2002).
The basic idea is to make a cavity by removing a variable xi along with all the factors around it, from the
factor graph (Figure 1(b)). We will use a more general
notion of regional cavity, around a region.
Definition A cavity region is a subset of variables r ⊆
{1, . . . , N } that are connected by a set of factors – i.e.,
the set of variable nodes r and the associated factors
N (r) := {N (i) | i ∈ r} forms a connected component
on the factor graph.
For example in Figure 1(a), the variables indexed
by r1 = {j, k, s} define a cavity region with factors
N (r1 ) = {I, T, Y, S, W, K}
Remark A “cavity region” is different from common
notion of region in region-graph methods, in that a
cavity region includes all factors in N (r) (and nothing
more), while common regions allow a factor I to be a
part of a region only if I ⊆ r.
The notation ⊕r := {i ∈ I | I ∈ N (r)} denotes
the cavity region r with its surrounding variables, and
r := ⊕r \ r denotes just the perimeter of the cavity
region r. In Figure 1(c), the dotted circles show the
indices r1 = {o, i, m, t, u, v, w} and their union with
the pale circles defines ⊕r1 .
Definition The Cavity Distribution, for cavity region

In practice, we can only obtain estimates P̂ \r (x r )
of the true cavity distribution P \r (x r ). However,
suppose we have multiple cavity regions r1 , r2 , . . . , rM
that collectively cover all the variables {x1 , . . . , xN }.
If rp intersects with rq , we can improve the estimate of P̂ \rp (x rp ) by enforcing marginal consistency
of P̂rp (x⊕rp ) with P̂rq (x⊕rq ) over the variables in
their intersection. This suggests an iterative correction scheme that is very similar to message passing.
In Figure 1(a), let each hexagon (over variables
and factors) define a cavity region, here r1 , . . . , r5 .
Note r1 can provide good estimates over {j, s, k},
given good approximation to cavity distribution over
{o, i, m, t, u, v, w}. This in turn can be improved by
neighboring regions; e.g., r2 gives a good approximation over {i, o}, and r3 over {i, m}. Starting from an
\r
initial cavity distribution P̂0 α , for each cavity region
α ∈ {1, . . . , 14}, We perform this improvement for all
cavity regions, in iterations until convergence.
\r

When we start with a uniform cavity distribution P̂0 p
for all regions, the results are very similar to those of
CVM. The accuracy of this approximation depends on
\r
the accuracy of the initial P̂0 p .
Following Mooij (2008), we use variable clamping to
estimate higher-order interactions in r: Here, we estimate the partition function Zx r after removing factors in N (r) and fixing x r to each possible assignment. Doing this calculation, we have P̂ \r (x r ) ∝
Zx r . In our experiments, we use the approximation
to the partition function provided using LBP. However
there are some alternatives to clamping: conditioning
scheme Rizzo et al. (2007) makes it possible to use

A Generalized Loop Correction Method

any method capable of marginalization for estimation
of cavity distribution (clamping requires estimation of
partition function). It is also possible to use techniques
in answering joint queries for this purpose (Koller &
Friedman (2009)).
Using clamping for this purpose also means that, if the
resulting network, after clamping, has no loops, then
P̂r (x⊕r ) is exact – hence GLC produces exact results
if for every cluster r, removing ⊕r results in a tree.

3.1. Simple Case: Partitioning Cavity Regions
To introduce our approach, first consider a simpler case where the cavity regions r1 , . . . , rM form
a (disjoint and exhaustive) partition of the variables
{1, . . . , N }.
Let rp,q := ( rp ) ∩ rq denote the intersection of the
perimeter rp of rp with another cavity region rq .
(Note rp,q 6= rq,p ). As r1 , . . . , rM is a partition,
each perimeter rp is a disjoint union of rp,q for
q = 1 . . . M (some of which might be empty if rp and rq
are not neighbors). Let N b(p) denote the set of regions
q with rp,q 6= ∅. We now consider how to improve the
cavity distribution estimate over rp through update
messages sent to each of the rp,q .
In Figure 1(a), the regions r2 , r4 , r5 , r7 , r11 , r14 form
a partitioning. Here, r2 with {m, k, s, w} ⊂ r2 , receives updates over r2,7 = {m} from r7 and updates over r2,4 = {k} from r4 . This last update
P
P
ensures x\{k} P̂r2 (x⊕r2 ) = x\{k} P̂r4 (x⊕r4 ). Towards enforcing this equality, we introduce a message
m4→2 (x r2,4 ) into distribution over ⊕r2 .
Here, the distribution over ⊕rp becomes: P̂rp (x⊕rp ) ∝

where P̂rp denotes our estimate of the true distribution Prp .
The messages mq→p can be recovered by considering marginalization constraints. When rp and rq
are neighbors, their distributions P̂rp (x⊕rp ) and
P̂rq (x⊕rq ) should satisfy

The last line follows from multiplying the numerator
and denominator by the current version of the message
mq→p . At convergence, when mq→p equals mnew
q→p , the
consistency constraints are satisfied. By repeating this
update in any order, after convergence, the P̂r (x⊕r )s
represent approximate marginals over each region.
The following theorem stablishes the relation between
GLC and CVM in a limited setting.
Theorem 1 If the cavity regions partition the variables and all the factors involve no more than 2 variables, then any GBP fixed point of a particular CVM
construction (details in Appendix A) is also a fixed
point for GLC, starting from uniform cavity distribu\r
tions P̂0 = 1. (Proof in Appendix A.)
Corollary 1 If the factors have size two and there are
no loops of size 4 in the factor graph, for single variable
partitioning with uniform cavity distribution, any fixed
points of LBP can be mapped to fixed points of GLC.

x\⊕rp ∩⊕rq

We can divide both sides by the factor product
ψN (rp )∩N (rq ) (x), as the domain of the factors in
N (rp ) ∩ N (rq ) is completely contained in ⊕rp ∩ ⊕rq
and independent of the summation. Hence we have

Proof If there are no loops of size 4 then no two factors have identical domain. Thus the factors are all
maximal and GBP applied to CVM with maximal factor domains, is the same as LBP. On the other hand
(refering to CVM construction of Appendix A) under
the given condition, GLC with single variable partitioning shares the fixed points of GBP applied to CVM

with maximal factors. Therefore GLC shares the fixed
points of LBP.

Theorem 2 If all factors have size two and no two
factors have the same domain, GLC is identical to
LCBP under single variable partitioning.
Proof Follows from comparison of two update equations – i.e., Eqn (3) and Eqn (5) in (Mooij & Kappen,
2007)– under the assumptions of the theorem.
3.2. General Cavity Regions
When cavity regions do not partition the set of variables, the updates are more involved. As the perimeter
rp is no longer partitioned, the rp,q ’s are no longer
disjoint.
For example in Figure 1, for r1 we have r1,2 = {o, i},
r1,3 = {i, m}, r1,4 = {t, u}, r1,5 = {v, w} and also
r1,6 = {i}, r1,7 = {m}, r1,8 = {m, t}, r1,9 = {t},
etc. This means xi appears in messages m2→1 , m3→1
and m6→1 .
Directly adopting the correction formula for P̂r in
Eqn (1) as a product of messsages over rp,q could
double-count variables. To avoid this problem, we
adopt a strategy similar to CVM to discount extra
contributions from overlapping variables in rp . For
each cavity region rp , we form a rp -region graph
(Figure 2) with the incoming messages forming the
distributions over top regions. For computational reasons, we only consider maximal rp,q domains.1 here,
this means dropping m6→1 as r1,6 ⊂ r1,2 and so on.
Our region-graph construction is similar to
CVM (Pelizzola, 2005) – i.e., we construct new
sub-regions as the intersection of rp,q ’s, and we
repeat this recursively until no new region can be
added. We then connect each sub-region to its
immediate parent. Figure 2 shows the r1 -region
graph for the example of Figure 1(a). If the cavity
regions are a partition, the rp -region graph includes
only the top regions. Below we use Rp to denote
the rp -region graph for rp ; RO
p to denote its top
(outer) regions; and brp (xρ ) to denote the belief over
region ρ in rp -region graph. For top-regions, the
initial belief is equal to the basic messages obtained
using Eqn (3).
Next we assign “counting numbers” to regions, in
a way similar to CVM: top regions are assigned
cn( rp,q ) = 1, and each sub-region ρ is assigned using
1

This does not noticably affect the accuracy in our experiments. When using uniform cavity distributions, the
results are identical.

This avoids any double-counting of variables, and reduces to Eqn (1) in the case of partitioning cavity regions.
To apply Eqn (4) effectively, we need to enforce
marginal consistency of the intersection regions with
their parents, which can be accomplished via message
passing in a downward pass, Each region ρ0 sends
to each of its child ρ, its marginal over the child’s
variables:
X
µρ0 →ρ (xρ ) :=
brp (xρ0 )
x\ ρ

Then set the belief over each child region to be the
geometric average Y
of the incoming messages:

That is, in the update equation, we need the calculation of the new message to assume this value as the
old message from q to p. This marginalization is important because it allows the belief at the top region

A Generalized Loop Correction Method

brp (x rp,q ) to be influenced by the beliefs brp (xρ ) of
the sub-regions after a downward pass. It enforces
marginal consistency between the top regions, and at
f
convergence we have bef
rp (x rp,q ) = brp (x rp,q ). Notice also Eqn (5) is equivalent to the old update Eqn (3)
in the partitioning case.
To calculate this marginalization more efficiently,
GLC uses an upward pass in the rp -region-graph.
Starting from the parents of the lowest regions, we def

Returning to the example, the previous text provides
a method to update P̂r1 (x⊕r1 ). GLC performs this
for the remaining regions as well, and then iterates
the entire process until convergence – i.e., until the
change in all distributions is less than a threshold.

4. Experiments
This section compares different variations of our
method against LBP as well as CVM, LCBP and
TreeEP (Minka & Qi, 2003) methods, each of which
performs some kind of loop correction. For CVM, we
use the double-loop algorithm of (Heskes, 2006), which
is slower than GBP but has better convergence properties. All methods are applied without any damping.
We stop each method after a maximum of 1E4 iterations or if the change in the probability distribution
(or messages) is less than 1E-9. We report the time
in seconds and the error for each method as the averagePof absolute error in single variable marginals –
i.e., xi ,v |P̂ (xi = v)−P (xi = v)|. For each setting, we
report the average results over 10 random instances of
the problem. We experimented with grids, 3-regular
random graphs, and the ALARM network as typical
benchmark problems.2
Both LCBP and GLC can be used with a uniform
initial cavity or with an initial cavity distribution estimated via clamping cavity variables. In the experiments, full and uniform refer to the kind of cavity
distribution used. We use GLC to denote the partitioning case, and GLC+ when overlapping clusters
of some form are used. For example, GLC+(Loop4,
full) refers to a setting with full cavity that contains
all overlapping loop clusters of length up to 4. If a
factor does not appear in any loops, it forms its own
cluster. The same form of clusters are used for CVM.

The evaluations are based on implementation in libdai
inference toolbox (Mooij, 2010).

Each method in the graph has 10 points, each representing
an Ising model of different size (10 to 100 variables).

4.1. Grids
We experimented with periodic Ising grids in which
xi ∈ {−1, +1} is a binary variable and the probability distribution of a setting when xi and xj
are connected
inPthe graph is given by P (x) ∝
P
exp( i θi xi + 12 i,j∈I Ji,j xi xj ) where Ji,j controls
variable interactions and θi defines a single node potential – a.k.a. a local field. In general, smaller local
fields and larger variable interactions result in more
difficult problems. We sampled local fields independently from N (0, 1) and interactions from N (0, β 2 ).
Figure 3(left) summarize the results for 6x6 grids for
different values of β.
We also experimented with periodic grids of different
sizes, generated by sampling all factor entries independently from N (0, 1). Figure 3(middle) compares the
computation time and error of different methods for
grids of sizes that range from 4x4 to 10x10.
4.2. Regular Graphs
We generated two sets of experiments with random
3-regular graphs (all nodes have degree 3) over 40
variables. Here we used Ising model when both local
fields and couplings are independently sampled from
N (0, β 2 ). Figure 3(right) show the time and error for
different values of β. Figure 4 shows time versus error
for graph size between 10 to 100 nodes for β = 1. For
larger βs, few instances did not converge within allocated number of iterations. The results are for cases
in which all methods converged.

4.3. Alarm Network

lacking in general single-loop GBP implementations.
GLC’s time complexity (when using full cavity, and
using LBP to estimate the cavity distribution) is
O(τ M N |X |u + λM |X |v )), where λ is the number of
iterations of GLC, τ is the maximum number of iterations for LBP, M is the number of clusters, N
is the number of variables, u = maxp |
rp | and
v = maxp | ⊕ rp |. Here the first term is the cost of
estimating the cavity distributions and the second is
the cost of exact inference on clusters. This makes
GLC especially useful when regional Markov blankets
are not too large.

5. Conclusions

Alarm is a Bayesian network with 37 variables and
37 factors. Variables are discrete, but not all are binary, and most factors have more than two variables.
Table(1) compares the accuracy versus run-time of different methods. GLC with factor domains as regions –
i.e., rp = I for I ∈ F – and all loopy clusters produces
exact results up to the convergence threshold.

We introduced GLC, an inference method that provide accurate inference by utilizing the loop correction schemes of both region-based and recent cavitybased methods. Experimental results on benchmarks
support the claim that, for difficult problems, these
schemes are complementary and our GLC can successfully exploit both. We also believe that our scheme
motivates possible variations that can also deal with
graphical models with large Markov blankets.

These results show that GLC consistently provides
more accurate results than both CVM and LCBP, although often at the cost of more computation time.
They also suggest that one may not achieve this tradeoff between time and accuracy simply by including
larger loops in CVM regions. When used with uniform
cavity, the performance of GLC (specifically GLC+)
is similar to CVM, and GLC appears stable, which is

A. Appendix
We prove the equality of GLC to CVM, in the setting
where each factor involves no more than 2 variables and
the cavity distributions P̂ \r (x r ) is uniform.3

of 1, while each subregion has a counting number of −1.
Since we assume the cavity regions rp form a partition and
each factor contains no more than 2 variables, this region
graph construction counts each variable and each factor
exactly once.
We focus on the parent-to-child algorithm for GBP.
For the specific region graph construction outlined, we
have 2 types of messages: internal region to subregion
int
sub
message (µis
to Rq,p
), and bridge region
q→p sent from Rq
bs
br
sub
to subregion message (µq→p sent from Rq,p
to Rq,p
).
sub
sub
br
Note that Rq,p and Rp,q are the intersection of Rp,q
with Rqint and Rpint respectively. We use the notation
µ to differentiate from messages m used in GLC. Below
we drop the arguments to make the equations more
readable. The parent-to-child algorithm uses the following
fixed-point equations:
P

∝ x\Rsub ψRint

q

µq→p ∝ x\Rsub ψRbr
µq→p

Suppose GBP converges to a fixed point with messages
bs
µis
q→p and µq→p satisfying the fixed point conditions above;
we show that messages defined by mq→p := µis
q→p are fixed
points of update Eqn (3) – i.e., satisfy the consistency condition of Eqn (2)
\r

Assuming uniform initial cavity P̂0 = 1, for LHS of
Eqn (2), we have

∝ mq→p = µis

as the domain of the expression inside the summation sign
is disjoint from rp,q .
As for the RHS of Eqn (2) we have

To differentiate from GLC’s cavity regions r, we use
the capital notation R to denote the corresponding region
in the CVM region graph construction.

Consider the following CVM region-graph:

and bridge Rp,q . It contains only variables and no

Removing µis

of ψRbr

its
domain is disjoint from the rest of the terms.

Moving the summation inside the product in line (7) is
valid because partitioning guarantees that product terms’
domains have no overlap and they are also disjoint from
ψRint

Thus the LHS and RHS of Eqn (2) agrees and mq→p :=

q→p is a fixed point of GLC.
