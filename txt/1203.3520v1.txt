Abstract
We study the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from data. We develop an algorithm for finding the k-best Bayesian network structures. We propose to compute the
posterior probabilities of hypotheses of interest
by Bayesian model averaging over the k-best
Bayesian networks. We present empirical results
on structural discovery over several real and synthetic data sets and show that the method outperforms the model selection method and the stateof-the-art MCMC methods.

1 Introduction
Bayesian networks (BN) are being widely used in various data mining tasks for probabilistic inference and causal
modeling [12, 15]. One major challenge in the applications of BN is to learn the structures of BNs from data.
In the Bayesian approach, we provide a prior probability
distribution over the space of possible Bayesian networks
and then compute the posterior distributions P (G|D) of the
network structure G given data D. We can then compute
the posterior probability of any hypothesis of interest by
averaging over all possible networks. In some applications
we are interested in structural features. For example, in
causal discovery, we are interested in the causal relations
among variables, represented by the edges in the network
structure [7]. In other applications we are interested in predicting the posterior probabilities of new observations, for
example, in classification tasks.
The number of possible network structures is superexponential O(n!2n(n−1)/2 ) in the number of variables n.
For example, there are about 104 directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) on 5 nodes, and 1018 DAGs on 10 nodes. As a result, it is impractical to sum over all possible structures unless for tiny domains (less than 7 variables). The most common solution is to use model selection approach in which

we use the relative posterior probability P (D, G) (or other
measures) as a scoring metric and we attempt to find a single network with the best score, the MAP network. We then
use that model (or its Markov equivalence class) to make
future predictions. This may be a good approximation if
the amount of data is large relative to the size of the model
such that the posterior is sharply peaked around the MAP
model. However, in domains where the amount of data is
small relative to the size of the model there are often many
high-scoring models with non-negligible posterior. In this
situation using a single model could lead to unwarranted
conclusions about the structure features and also poor predictions about new observations. For example, the edges
that appear in the MAP model do not necessarily appear in
other approximately equally likely models. Also the model
selection may be sensitive to the data samples given in the
sense that a different set of data (from the same distribution) might well lead to a different MAP model. In such
cases, using Bayesian model averaging is preferred.
Recently there has been progress on computing exact posterior probabilities of structural features such as edges
or subnetworks using dynamic programming techniques
[8, 9, 16]. These techniques have exponential time and
memory complexity and are capable of handling data sets
with up to around 20 variables. One problem with these
algorithms is that they can only computer posteriors over
modular features such as directed edges but can not compute non-modular features such as paths (“is there a path
between nodes X and Y ”). Another problem is that it
is very expensive to perform data prediction tasks. They
can compute the exact posterior of new observational data
P (x|D) but the algorithms have to be re-run for each new
data case x.
When computing exact posterior probabilities of features
is not feasible, one solution that has been proposed is to
approximate full Bayesian model averaging by finding a
set of high-scoring networks and making prediction using
these models [7, 10]. This leaves open the question of how
to construct the set of representative models. One possible
approach is to use the bootstrap technique which has been

studied in [4]. However there are still many questions that
need further study on how to use the bootstrap to approximate the Bayesian posterior.
One theoretically well-founded approach is to use Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Madigan and
York [11] used MCMC algorithm in the space of network
structures (i.e., DAGs). Friedman and Koller [5] developed
a MCMC procedure in the space of node orderings which
was shown to be more efficient than MCMC in the space
of DAGs and to outperform the bootstrap approach in [4]
as well. Eaton and Murphy [3] developed a hybrid MCMC
method (DP+MCMC) that first uses the dynamic programming technique in [8] to develop a global proposal distribution and then runs MCMC in the DAG space. Their experiments showed that the DP+MCMC algorithm converged
faster than previous two methods [5, 11] and resulted in
more accurate structure learning. One common problem to
the MCMC and bootstrap approach is that there is no guarantee on the quality of the approximation in finite runs.
Madigan and Raftery [10] has proposed to discard the models whose posterior probability is much lower than the best
ones (as well as complex models whose posterior probability is lower than some simpler one). In this paper, we
study the approach of approximating Bayesian model averaging using a set of best Bayesian networks. It is intuitive
to make predictions using a set of the best models, and we
believe it is due to the computational difficulties of actually
finding the best networks that this idea has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we develop an algorithm
for finding the k-best network structures by generalizing
the dynamic programming algorithm for finding the optimal Bayesian network structures in [13, 14]. We demonstrate the algorithm on several real data sets from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository [1] and synthetic data sets
from a gold-standard network. We then empirically study
the quality of Bayesian model averaging using the k-best
networks in structure discovery and show that the method
outperforms the model selection method and the state-ofthe-art MCMC methods.

2 Bayesian Learning of Bayesian Networks
A Bayesian network is a DAG G that encodes a joint probability distribution over a set X = {X1 , . . . , Xn } of random
variables with each node of the graph representing a variable in X. For convenience we will typically work on the
index set V = {1, . . . , n} and represent a variable Xi by
its index i. We use XP ai ⊆ X to represent the set of parents of Xi in a DAG G and use P ai ⊆ V to represent the
corresponding index set.
In the problem of learning BNs from data we are given a
training data set D = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN }, where each xi is
a particular instantiation over the set of variables X. In
this paper we only consider situations where the data are

complete, that is, every variable in X is assigned a value. In
the Bayesian approach to learning Bayesian networks from
the training data D, we compute the posterior probability
of a network G as
P (G|D) =

P (D|G)P (G)
.
P (D)

(1)

Assuming global/local parameter independence, and parameter/structure modularity, ln P (D|G)P (G) can be decomposed into a summation of so-called local scores as
[2, 6]
ln P (G, D) =

n
X

scorei (P ai : D) ≡ score(G : D),

i=1

(2)
where, with appropriate parameter priors, scorei (P ai : D)
has a closed form solution. In this paper we will focus
on discrete random variables assuming that each variable
Xi can take values from a finite domain. We will use the
popular BDe score for scorei (P ai : D) and we refer to
[6] for its detailed expression. Often for convenience we
will omit mentioning D explicitly and use scorei (P ai ) and
score(G).
In the Bayesian framework, we compute the posterior probability of any hypothesis of interest h by averaging over all
possible networks.
X
P (h|D) =
P (h|G, D)P (G|D).
(3)
G

Since the number of possible DAGs is superexponential in
the number of variables n, it is impractical to sum over
all DAGs unless for very small networks . One solution
is to approximate this exhaustive enumeration by using a
selected set of models in G
P
P (h|G, D)P (G|D)
P̂ (h|D) = G∈GP

where P̂ (.) denote approximated probabilities. In the
model selection approach, we find a high-scoring model
Gs and use it to make predictions:
P̂ (h|D) = P (h|Gs , D).

(6)

In this paper we will perform model averaging using the set
G of k-best networks.
We can estimate the posterior probability of a network G ∈
G as
P (G, D)
.
G∈G P (G, D)

P̂ (G|D) = P

(7)

P
Since G∈G P (G, D) is not greater than P (D), the estimate P̂ (G|D) is always anPupper bound of P (G|D), and it
is a good estimate only if G∈G P (G|D) is close to 1. We
can then estimate the posterior probability of hypothesis h
by
X
P̂ (h|D) =
P (h|G, D)P̂ (G|D).

If we are interested in computing the posteriors of structural
features such as edges, paths, Markov Blankets, etc.. Let f
be a structural feature represented by an indicator function
such that f (G) is 1 if the feature is present in G and 0
otherwise. We have P (f |G, D) = f (G) and
X
f (G)P̂ (G|D).

3 Finding the k-best Network Structures
We find the k-best structures using the dynamic programming techniques extending the algorithm for finding the optimal Bayesian network structures in [13]. Our algorithm
consists of three steps:
1. Compute the local scores for all possible n2n−1
(i, P ai ) pairs.
2. For each variable i ∈ V , find the k-best parent sets in
parent candidate set C for all C ⊆ V \ {i}.
3. Find the k-best networks.
Step 1 is exactly the same as in [13] and we will use their
algorithm. Assuming that we have calculated all the local
scores, next we describe how to accomplish Steps 2 and 3
using dynamic programming technique.
3.1 Finding the k-best parent sets
We can find the k-best parent sets for a variable v from a
candidate set C recursively. The k-best parent sets in C for

Algorithm 1 Finding the k-best parent sets for variable v

Input:
scorev (C): local scores
bestP arentsv [S]: priority queues of the k-best parent sets
for variable v from candidate set S for all S ⊆ C with
|S| = |C| − 1
Output:
bestP arentsv [C]: a priority queue of the k-best parents of
v from the candidate set C
Initialize bestP arentsv [C]
for all S ⊆ C such that |S| = |C| − 1 do {
bestP arentsv [C] ← M erge(bestP arentsv [C],
bestP arentsv [S])
}
Insert C into bestP arentsv [C] if scorev (C) is larger than
the minimum score in bestP arentsv [C]

v are the k-best sets among the whole candidate set C itself,
and the k-best parent sets for v from each of the smaller
candidate sets {C \ {c}|c ∈ C}. Therefore, to compute the
k-best parent sets for v for every candidate set C ⊆ V \{v},
we start with sets of size |C| = 1, then consider sets of
|C| = 2, and so on, until the set C = V \ {v}.
The skeleton algorithm for finding the k-best parent sets for
v from a candidate set C is given in Algorithm 1, where we
use bestP arentsv [S] to denote the k best parent sets for
variable v from candidate set S stored in a priority queue,
and the operation M erge(., .) outputs a priority queue of
the k best parents given the two input priority queues of k
elements. Assuming that the merge operation takes time
T (k), finding the k-best parent sets for v from a candidate set C takes time O(T (k) ∗ |C|), and computing
¡n−1¢for
Pn−1
all C ⊆ V \ {v} takes time |C|=1 T (k) ∗ |C| ∗ |C| =
O(T (k)(n − 1)2n−2 ).
3.2 Finding the k-best network structures
Having calculated the k-best parent sets for each variable v
from any set C, finding the k-best network structures over a
variable set W can be done recursively. We will exploit the
fact that every DAG has a sink, a node that has no outgoing
edges. First for each variable s ∈ W , we can find the kbest networks over W with s as a sink. Then the k-best
networks over W are the k-best networks among {the kbest networks over W with s as a sink : s ∈ W }.
The k-best networks over W with s as a sink can be identified by looking at the k-best parent sets for s from the set
W \ {s} and the k-best networks over W \ {s}.1 More
formally, let bestP arentss [C][i] denote the ith best parent set for variable s in the candidate parent set C. Let
1
This is because for any networks not constructed out of these
parents sets for s and networks over W \ {s} we can always produce k better networks.

synthetic data sets of various sample sizes from a goldstandard 15-variable Bayesian network with known structure and parameters. All the data sets contain discrete variables (or are discretized) and have no missing values.
4.1 Performance evaluation
For each data set, we learned the k-best networks for certain k, then we can estimate the posterior probabilities
P̂ (h|D) of any hypotheses using Eqs. (7) and (8). To get
an idea on how close the estimation is to the true posteriors
we used the algorithm in [16] to compute the exact P (D).
We can then evaluate the quality of the posterior estimation
as follows. Define the following quantity:
P
X
P (G, D)
∆ ≡ G∈G
=
P (G|D).
(15)
P (D)
G∈G

∆ represents the cumulative true probability mass of the
graphs in G. From Eqs. (1) and (7) we obtain

bestN ets[W ][j] denote the jth best network over W . Define the function value(i, j) as
value(i, j) =scores (bestP arentss [W \ {s}][i])
+ score(bestN ets[W \ {s}][j]). (13)
Then the k-best networks over W with s as a sink can be
identified by finding the k-best scores among
{value(i, j) : i = 1, . . . , k,

j = 1, . . . , k.}.

(14)

P (G|D)
P̂ (G|D)

= ∆.

Note that ∆ ≤ 1 and the larger value of ∆ means the closer
estimation P̂ (G|D) to exact P (G|D). In general we have
the following results on the quality of estimation P̂ (h|D).
Proposition 1
− (1 − ∆)P̂ (h|D) ≤ P (h|D) − P̂ (h|D) ≤ (1 − ∆)(1−
P̂ (h|D)),

This can be done by using a standard best-first graph search
algorithm over a search space {(i, j) : i = 1, . . . , k, j =
1, . . . , k} with root node (1, 1), children of (i, j) being (i+
1, j) and (i, j + 1), and the value of each node given by
value(i, j).
The skeleton algorithm for finding the k-best network
structures over a set W is given in Algorithm 2. Let the
time spent on the best-first search be T 0 (k). In the worst
case all k 2 nodes may need to be visited. P

4 Experiments
We used BDe score for scorei (P ai : D) with a uniform
structure prior P (G) and equivalent sample size 1 [6]. We
have implemented our algorithm in C++ language and all
the experiments on our method were run under Linux on an
ordinary desktop PC with a 3.0GHz Intel Pentium processor and 2.0GB memory.
We tested our algorithm on several data sets from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository [1]: Iris, Nursery, Tic-TacToe, Zoo and Letter. We also tested our algorithm on

(16)

(17)

or equivalently
∆P̂ (h|D) ≤ P (h|D) ≤ ∆P̂ (h|D) + 1 − ∆.

(18)

The proof is given in the Appendix.
In practice, in the cases we do not have a large amount of
data, ∆ may be much smaller than 1 and the bounds in
proposition 1 could be too loose to be useful. Therefore,
we introduce another measure for the quality of the posterior estimation, the relative ratio of the posterior probability
of the MAP network Gmap over the posterior of the worst
network Gmin of the k best networks (the k-th best network):
λ≡

P̂ (Gmap |D)
P̂ (Gmin |D)

=

P (Gmap |D)
P (Gmin |D)

(19)

It has been argued in [10] that we should make predictions
using a set of the best models discarding those models that
predict the data far less well even though the very many
models with small posterior probabilities may contribute
substantially to the sum (such that ∆ is much smaller than
1). A cutoff value of λ = 20 is suggested in [10] by analogy
with the 0.05 cutoff for P-values.

4.2 Experimental results on the k-best networks
We tested our algorithm on several data sets and the experimental results are reported in Table 1, which lists for each
data set the number of variables n, the number of instances
(sample size) m, the value k, the time Tl for computing
local scores (the time depends on m but not k), the total
running time Tt for finding the k-best networks, and the
quality measure ∆ and λ.
As expected the values of ∆ and λ (as a measure of estimation quality) increases as k increases. We see that ∆ value
is often too small for Proposition 1 to be useful, however
Proposition 1 can indeed provide guarantee on the quality
of approximation in nontrivial cases like Nursey and TicTac-Toe data sets which are still too large for exhaustive
enumeration of all possible networks. Based on the λ value,
the best 100 networks are not enough to get reliable estimation for Zoo and letter data sets. For the synthetic data set,
λ increases as the sample size m increases. Based on the λ
value, the best 100 networks should give reliable estimation
for m = 3000 and m = 5000.
The exact posterior probabilities of k-best networks for
each data set are shown in Figures 1 and 2. We see that
there could be multiple networks having the same posterior probability. For example, the number of best networks
sharing the largest posterior probability is as follows: 2 for
Nursery case, 76 for Tic-Tac-Toe case, 12 for Letter case,
26 for synthetic data with m = 200, and 6 for synthetic
data with m = 5000. This is mainly due to that BDe scoring criterion has the likelihood-equivalence property, i.e.,
it assigns the same score to the Bayesian networks within
the same independence equivalence class. However, we

have found that it is also possible that the networks across
the different equivalence classes have the same posterior
probability. Take Tic-Tac-Toe case for example, we have
found that the 76 best networks actually belong to multiple
equivalence classes which have different skeletons. This
exceptional case shows that one can not always assert that
the networks having the same posterior probability must be
within the same equivalence class.
In Table 2 we show the difference between the best equivalence class and the second best equivalence class for each
case. The second column lists the number of different undirected edges between these 2 best equivalence classes and
the third column shows λ (the relative ratio of their posterior probabilities). The result shows that their difference is
typically small for each case.
4.3 Structural discovery
In order to evaluate the ability of the k-best networks
method in structural discovery, we tested on the synthetic
data set from the gold-standard 15-variable Bayesian network. We computed edge feature between each pair of
variables by Eq. (9) under the different values of k ∈
{1, 10, 100}. For the comparison, we also computed the
exact posterior probability of each edge by the method of
full model averaging in [16]. Since we have the true goldstandard network, we could compute all the corresponding
ROC curves. The results are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
The figures indicate the usefulness of k-best method in
structural discovery. We observe that the area under ROC
(AUC) is a non-decreasing function of k. Even a small
increase of k from 1 to 10 will lead to a non-negligible
improvement in the corresponding ROC, even though ∆ is
tiny (such as 2.37e−05) and λ is small (such as 1.203). For
the data set with m = 5, 000, the performance of Top 100
is almost the same as that of full model averaging method
when λ is big (2, 406), regardless of the fact that ∆ is still
tiny (2.94e − 06).
The comparison with MCMC approach also demonstrates
the usefulness of our method. In this paper we compared our method with the hybrid method (DP+MCMC)

proposed by Eaton and Murphy [3], which was shown
to have the statistically significant improvement in structural discovery over other MCMC methods [5, 11]. For
DP+MCMC, we set the pure global proposal (with local
proposal choice β = 0) since such a setting was reported
to have the best performance (with the largest mean and
the smallest variance of AUC) for edge discovery in their
experimental results. The tool BDAGL provided by the authors in [3] was used for the experiments on DP+MCMC.
We ran totally 120, 000 iterations and discarded the first
100, 000 iterations as burn-in period. Then we set the thinning parameter as 2 to get final 10, 000 samples (networks).
Finally the posterior probability of each edge was computed based on the model averaging among these 10, 000
networks and the corresponding ROC was drawn.
Because of the randomness nature of MCMC, we repeated
the above process 10 times for each data set.2 The best,
worst and median of these 10 ROCs were shown in the figures, compared with the ROC from Top 100 (i.e. the 100
best). In the case of m = 1, 000, the figure shows that
the performance of DP+MCMC still has a non-negligible
variability and the performance of Top 100 is no worse
than the performance of the median of DP+MCMC. In
the case of m = 5, 000, the variability of the performance of DP+MCMC decreases. However, even the best of
DP+MCMC could not outperform Top 100. The good performance of our model averaging over only 100 networks
is not surprising: the 100 networks used here are the top
100 networks and have the relative importance than all the
other networks in the model average process. Figure 2 has
clearly demonstrated such a relative importance of these
top 100 networks.

5 Conclusion
We develop an algorithm for finding the k-best Bayesian
network structures. We present empirical results on the
structural discovery by Bayesian model averaging over the
k best Bayesian networks. One nice feature of the method
is that we can monotonically improve the estimation accuracy by spending more time to compute for larger k. Another interesting feature shown by our experiments is that
we may evaluate the quality of the estimation based on the
value of λ. The relation between the estimation quality and
λ is worth more substantial study in the future.
As the experimental results show, there are many equivalent networks in the set of best networks. It is desirable if

The DP step (including marginal likelihood computation)
took 221 seconds and MCMC iterations took the mean of 134
seconds in the case of m = 1, 000. The most part of BDAGL was
written in Matlab and we ran BDAGL under Windows XP on an
ordinary laptop with 1.60GHz Intel Pentium processor and 1.5GB
memory. Due to the different hardware, platforms and programming languages used, the time statistics of DP+MCMC can not
be directly compared with the ones of our method.

we can directly find the k best equivalence classes. However, the proposed algorithm does not search in the equivalence class space. The algorithm will find the top k individual networks regardless of the existence of equivalent networks. It seems that the dynamic programming idea cannot
be naturally generalized to the equivalence class space (at
least we were not able to achieve this). How to directly find
the k best equivalence classes is a research direction that is
worth to pursue.
