In this section, I assume that the joint distribution
P(X) is known; this is equivalent to recovering P(X)
from its maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the

Model selection via Kullback-Leibler

Given a graph g E Yn, the distribution directed
Markov with respect to g (that is, factorizes as (1))
which has minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence from
P(X) obeys (2) for each node in the graph. In prin­
ciple, one could perform an exhaustive search over all
possible graphs g E Yn, finding their closest matching
distributions P9(X) in terms of Kullback-Leibler di­
vergence from P(X), selecting those graphs for which
the Kullback-Leibler divergence vanishes, and select­
ing among these graphs the one having the fewest num­
ber of edges.
Consider a graph g E 9n, and it associated distribu­
tion P9(X) which satisfies (2). The Kullback-Leibler
divergence is given by

The minimal set Xpa(i) may then be taken as the set

Note that (6) decomposes into a sum of terms, one
for each node, where the g-dependence of the term
on each node depends upon the family in g of that
node. In fact for the same graph g, the ith term in
the summation (6) is identical to the cross entropy
expression (4). Thus, an exhaustive search based upon
conditional independence is equivalent to an exhaustive

search which minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence.

threshold e such that if the change is greater than e
the difference is taken to be significant - to do this
we must first normalize (10) by the total number of

where p represents the (marginal of the) MLE of the

A more formal approach would be based on hypoth­
esis testing. Note that twice the value of (10) is the
difference in the deviances of the two models, which
under the assumption that the larger model is true,
and that the smaller model is also true, will have a
X� distribution with k equal to the difference in the
degrees of freedom of the two nested models. Thus we
perform the same test, and obtain the same result, as
the formal conditional independence test described at
the end of Section 5.1. Alternatively, one could penal­
ize the deviance by some function of the number of
parameters, for example by using the Akaike Informa­
tion Criterion (Akaike 1973) which penalizes the more
complex model by twice the number of extra parame­
ters.

More generally, because of the equality of (8) and (9)
it follows as in the last paragraph of Section 4.2, that
for every search heuristic based upon testing for con­
ditional independence, there is an equivalent search
heuristic based upon using changes in log-maximum­
likelihood, and vice versa. There is no fundamental
difference between the two approaches, only a differ­
ence in interpretation.
5.3

The Bayesian approach.

Many belief network search algorithms using a scor­
ing metric tend to employ the Bayesian formalism,
with the score being the log-marginal likelihood. The
advantages are that for smaller data sets, where the
asymptotic distribution results required for the tests in
Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 may not apply (although
exact classical tests are available, see Chapter 4 of Lau­
ritzen (1996)), the results tend to be more robust and,
furthermore, generally less sensitive to the presence of
zeroes in marginal counts.
The Bayesian approach requires a prior on the space
of graphical structures - usually this is taken to be
uniform, but there are other alternatives (Beckerman
1998). For each graphical structure a prior on the

95

probability parameters is also required - usually these
are taken to be locally independent Dirichlet priors.
Under these assumptions and complete data the mar­
ginal likelihood may be evaluated explicitly and de­
composes into a product of terms, one for each node.
An early and important paper is Cooper and Ber­
skovits (1992), who gave an explicit formula for the
marginal likelihood under these conditions.
A common feature of the analyses given in Section 5.1
and Section 5.2 is that the global scores factorize into
local contributions from each node, and, moreover,
that in comparing two similar graphs their score dif­
ference is identical to quantities which arise when test­
ing conditional independence using cross entropy mea­
sures. I shall now show that a similar circumstance
arises in a Bayesian approach when globally indepen­
dent priors are employed. The key feature is that
global independence is preserved under updating with
complete data (Cowell et al. 1999).
Thus suppose each node v of a graph g E 9n has an
associated (vector) parameterization 8� of the condi­
tional probability table of v, and a globally indepen­
dent prior distribution over the parameters 89 := {8� :
v E V}. Global independence means that the prior
measure factorizes as d7r9(89) = flv d1r9(8�). Under
these conditions the marginal likelihood of the graph
g in the light of complete data D is

L(g) :=p(Dig) = J Pg(Dig,89)d7rg(B9)

=II 1
V

II Pg(Xv IXpa(v)' e�r(xv,Xp�(v))d1l'g(8�).

Bv Xu ,Xpa(v)

(11)

From (11) we see that the marginal likelihood factor­
izes into terms, one for each node and it parents. As
before, let g' be a graph identical to graph g except
for a difference in the parent set of the Xi. Then g'
will require a different parameterization and associated
prior, (see Cowell (1996), Beckerman et al. (1995) for
alternative strategies for doing this for Dirichlet pri­
ors), but we may take for every node other than Xi
the same local parameterization and contribution to
the prior as for the graph g (that is, for Xv =1- Xi,

e�' = e�, Pg'(Xv IXpa(v:g'),e�') = Pg(Xv IX pa(v:g)•e�)
andd7r9(8Z) = d1!' ,(8z')). If, furthermore, we take uni­
9
form priors over the alternative graphical structures
(ie, P(g) = P(g')), then after suitable cancellations
we obtain the ratio of posterior probabilities given in
(12) .
