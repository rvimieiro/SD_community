Abstract
Compiling graphical models has recently been
under intense investigation, especially for probabilistic modeling and processing. We present
here a novel data structure for compiling
weighted graphical models (in particular, probabilistic models), called AND/OR Multi-Valued
Decision Diagram (AOMDD). This is a generalization of our previous work on constraint networks, to weighted models. The AOMDD is
based on the frameworks of AND/OR search
spaces for graphical models, and Ordered Binary
Decision Diagrams (OBDD). The AOMDD is a
canonical representation of a graphical model,
and its size and compilation time are bounded exponentially by the treewidth of the graph, rather
than pathwidth as is known for OBDDs. We discuss a Variable Elimination schedule for compilation, and present the general APPLY algorithm
that combines two weighted AOMDDs, and also
present a search based method for compilation
method. The preliminary experimental evaluation is quite encouraging, showing the potential
of the AOMDD data structure.

Introduction

We present here an extension of AND/OR Multi-Valued
Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs) [13] to general weighted
graphical models, including Bayesian networks, influence
diagrams and Markov random fields.
The work on AOMDDs is based on two existing frameworks: (1) AND/OR search spaces for graphical models
and (2) decision diagrams (DD). AND/OR search spaces
[9] have proven to be a unifying framework for various
classes of search algorithms for graphical models. The
main characteristic is the exploitation of independencies
between variables during search, which can provide exponential speedups over traditional search methods that can

be viewed as traversing an OR structure. The AND nodes
capture problem decomposition into independent subproblems, and the OR nodes represent branching according to
variable values.
Decision diagrams are widely used in many areas of research, especially in software and hardware verification [5].
A BDD represents a Boolean function by a directed acyclic
graph with two sink nodes (labeled 0 and 1), and every internal node is labeled with a variable and has exactly two
children: low for 0 and high for 1. A BDD is ordered
if variables are encountered in the same order along every path. A BDD is reduced if all isomorphic nodes (i.e.,
with the same label and identical children) are merged, and
all redundant nodes (i.e., whose low and high children are
identical) are eliminated. The result is the celebrated reduced ordered binary decision diagram, or OBDD [3].
AOMDDs combine the two ideas, in order to create a decision diagram that has an AND/OR structure, thus exploiting problem decomposition. As a detail, the number of values is also increased from two to any constant, but this is
less significant for the algorithms.
A decision diagram offers a compilation of a problem. It
typically requires an extended offline effort in order to be
able to support polynomial (in its size) or constant time online queries. The benefit of moving from OR structure to
AND/OR is in a lower complexity of the algorithms and
size of the compiled structure. It typically moves from
being bounded exponentially in pathwidth pw∗ , which is
characteristic to chain decompositions or linear structures,
to being exponentially bounded in treewidth w∗ , which is
characteristic of tree structures (it always holds that w∗ ≤
pw∗ and pw∗ ≤ w∗ · log n).
Our contributions in this paper are as follows. (1) We formally describe the extension of AND/OR multi-valued decision diagram (AOMDD) to weighted graphical models.
(2) We describe the extension to weighted models of the
APPLY operator that combines two AOMDDs by an operation. The output of APPLY is still bounded by the product
of the sizes of the inputs. (3) We present two compilation

algorithms for AOMDDs. One is based on the repeated application of APPLY along a Variable Elimination schedule.
The other is based on search. Both schemes are exponential in the treewidth of the model. (4) We provide encouraging preliminary experimental evaluation of the search based
compilation method. (5) We discuss how AOMDDs relate
to various earlier and recent works, providing a unifying
perspective for all these methods.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides
preliminaries. Section 3 gives an overview of AND/OR
search space. Section 4 describes the AOMDD for constraint networks, the Variable Elimination schedule for
compilation and the APPLY operator, and a search based
compilation scheme. Section 5 contains the main contribution: the extension of AOMDDs to weighted models, and
a discussion of their canonical form and the extensions of
the compilation schedule and APPLY operator. Section 6
provides experimental evaluation and section 7 concludes.

Preliminaries

In this section we describe graphical models, Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Variable Elimination.
D EFINITION 1 (graphical model) A graphical model R
is a 4-tuple, R = hX, D, F, ⊗i, where: (1) X =
{X1 , . . . , Xn } is a set of variables; (2) D =
{D1 , . . . , Dn } is the set of their respective finite domains
of values; (3) F = {f1 , . . . , fr } is a set of discrete realvalued functions, each defined over a subset of variables
Si ⊆ X, called its scope,
Q and
P sometimes denoted by
scope(fi ). (4) ⊗i fi ∈ { i fi , i fi , 1i fi } is a combination operator1 . The graphical model represents the combination of all its functions: ⊗ri=1 fi . A reasoning task is

Examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks,
constraint networks, influence diagrams, Markov networks.

based on a projection (elimination) operator, ⇓, and is defined by: ⇓Z1 ⊗ri=1 fi , . . . , ⇓Zt ⊗ri=1 fi , where Zi ⊆ X.

The combination operator can be defined axiomatically [17].

D EFINITION 2 (universal equivalent graphical model)
Given a graphical model R = hX, D, F1 , ⊗i the universal equivalent model of R is u(R) = hX, D, F2 =
{⊗fi ∈F1 fi }, ⊗i.
Two graphical models are equivalent if they represent the
same set of solutions. Namely, if they have the same universal model.
D EFINITION 3 (primal graph) The primal graph of a
graphical model is an undirected graph that has variables
as its vertices and an edge connects any two variables that
appear in the scope of the same function.
A pseudo tree resembles the tree rearrangements [11]:
D EFINITION 4 (pseudo tree) A pseudo tree of a graph
G = (X, E) is a rooted tree T having the same set of
nodes X, such that every arc in E is a back-arc in T (i.e.,
it connects nodes on the same path from root).
D EFINITION 5 (induced graph,
induced width,
treewidth, pathwidth) An ordered graph is a pair (G, d),
where G is an undirected graph, and d = (X1 , ..., Xn )
is an ordering of the nodes. The width of a node in an
ordered graph is the number of neighbors that precede it in
the ordering. The width of an ordering d, denoted by w(d),
is the maximum width over all nodes. The induced width
of an ordered graph, w∗ (d), is the width of the induced
ordered graph obtained as follows: for each node, from
last to first in d, its preceding neighbors are connected in
a clique. The induced width of a graph, w∗ , is the minimal
induced width over all orderings. The induced width is
also equal to the treewidth of a graph. The pathwidth
pw∗ of a graph is the treewidth over the restricted class of
orderings that correspond to chain decompositions.

can be used to represent functions. Due to the fundamental importance of Boolean functions, a lot of effort has
been dedicated to the study of Binary Decision Diagrams
(BDDs), which are extensively used in software and hardware verification [5, 15, 12, 3].
A BDD is a representation of a Boolean function. Given
B = {0, 1}, a Boolean function f : Bn → B, has n arguments, X1 , · · · , Xn , which are Boolean variables, and takes
Boolean values. A Boolean function can be represented by
a table (see Figure 1(a)), but this is exponential in n, and
so is the binary tree representation in Figure 1(b). The goal
is to have a compact representation, that also supports efficient operations between functions. OBDDs [3] provide
such a framework by imposing the same order to the variables along each path in the binary tree, and then applying
the following two reduction rules exhaustively:
(1) isomorphism: merge nodes that have the same label
and the same respective children (see Figure 1(c)).
(2) redundancy: eliminate nodes whose low (zero) and
high (one) edges point to the same node, and connect
the parent of removed node directly to the child of removed node (see Figure 1(d)).
The resulting OBDD is shown in Figure 1(e).

AND/OR Search Space

The AND/OR search space [9] is a recently introduced
unifying framework for advanced algorithmic schemes for
graphical models. Its main virtue consists in exploiting independencies between variables during search, which can
provide exponential speedups over traditional search methods oblivious to problem structure.
3.1

AND/OR Search Trees

Given a graphical model M = hX, D, Fi, its primal graph
G and a pseudo tree T of G, the associated AND/OR
search tree, ST (R), has alternating levels of OR and AND
nodes. The OR nodes are labeled Xi and correspond to the
variables. The AND nodes are labeled hXi , xi i and correspond to the value assignments in the domains of the variables. The structure of the AND/OR search tree is based
on the underlying pseudo tree T . The root of the AND/OR
search tree is an OR node labeled with the root of T . The
children of an OR node Xi are AND nodes labeled with
assignments hXi , xi i. that are consistent with the assignments along the path from the root. The children of an
AND node hXi , xi i are OR nodes labeled with the children
of variable Xi in the pseudo tree T .
The AND/OR search tree can be traversed by a depth first
search algorithm, thus using linear space. It was already
shown [11, 1, 6, 9] that:

Variable elimination (VE) [2, 8] is a well known algorithm for inference in graphical models. Consider a graphical model R = hX, D, Fi and an elimination ordering
d = (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn ) (Xn is eliminated first, X1 last).
Each function placed in the bucket of its latest variable in
d. Buckets are processed from Xn to X1 by eliminating
the bucket variable (the functions residing in the bucket are
combined together, and the bucket variable is projected out)
and placing the resulting function (also called message) in
the bucket of its latest variable in d. Figure 2(a) shows a
graphical model and 2(b) the execution of VE.

T HEOREM 1 Given a graphical model M and a pseudo
tree T of depth m, the size of the AND/OR search tree
based on T is O(n k m ), where k bounds the domains of
variables. A graphical model having treewidth w∗ has a
pseudo tree of depth at most w∗ log n, therefore it has an
∗
AND/OR search tree of size O(n k w log n ).

VE execution defines a bucket tree, by linking the bucket
of each Xi to the destination bucket of its message (called
the parent bucket). A node in the bucket tree has a bucket
variable, a collection of functions, and a scope (the union
of the scopes of its functions). If the nodes of the bucket
tree are replaced by their respective bucket variables, we
obtain a pseudo tree (see Figure 2(c) and 3(b)).

The AND/OR search tree may contain nodes that root identical conditioned subproblems. These nodes are said to be
unifiable. When unifiable nodes are merged, the search
space becomes a graph. Its size becomes smaller at the
expense of using additional memory by the search algorithm. The depth first search algorithm can therefore be
modified to cache previously computed results, and retrieve

them when the same nodes are encountered again. Some
unifiable nodes can be identified based on their contexts.
We can define graph based contexts for both OR nodes and
AND nodes, just by expressing the set of ancestor variables
in T that completely determine a conditioned subproblem.
However, it can be shown that using caching based on OR
contexts makes caching based on AND contexts redundant,
so we will only use OR caching.
Given a pseudo tree T of an AND/OR search space, the
context of an OR node X, denoted by context(X) =
[X1 . . . Xp ], is the set of ancestors of X in T ordered descendingly, that are connected in the primal graph to X or
to descendants of X.
It is easy to verify that the context of X separates the subproblem below X from the rest of the network. The context minimal AND/OR graph is obtained by merging all the
context unifiable OR nodes. It was shown that [1, 9]:
T HEOREM 2 Given a graphical model M, its primal
graph G and a pseudo tree T , the size of the context min∗
imal AND/OR search graph based on T is O(n k wT (G) ),
∗
where wT (G) is the induced width of G over the depth first
traversal of T , and k bounds the domain size.
Figure 3(a) shows the primal graph of a graphical model
defined by the functions f1 , . . . , f4 , which are assumed to
be strictly positive (i.e., every assignment is valid). Figure
3(b) shows a pseudo tree for the graph. The dotted lines are
edges in the primal graph, and back-arcs in the pseudo-tree.
The OR context of each node is shown in square brackets.
Figure 3(c) shows the AND/OR search tree and 3(d) shows
the context minimal AND/OR graph.

In some cases (e.g. constraint networks), the functions of
the graphical model take binary values (0 and 1, or true and
false). In this case, an AND/OR search graph expresses
the consistency (valid or not) of each assignment, and can
associate this value with its leaves.
In more general cases, which are the focus of this paper, the
functions of the graphical model take (positive) real values, called weights. For example, in Bayesian networks
the weights express the conditional probability. In the
more general case of weighted models, it is useful to associate weights to the internal OR-AND arcs in the AND/OR
graph, to maintain the global function decomposition and
facilitate the merging of nodes.
D EFINITION 6 (buckets relative to a backbone tree)
Given a graphical model R = hX, D, F, ⊗i and a
backbone tree T , the bucket of Xi relative to T , denoted
by BT (Xi ), is the set of functions whose scopes contain
Xi and are included in pathT (Xi ), which is the set of
variables from the root to Xi in T . Namely, BT (Xi ) =
{f ∈ F |Xi ∈ scope(f ), scope(f ) ⊆ pathT (Xi )}.
D EFINITION 7 (OR-AND weights) Given an AND/OR
tree ST (R), of a graphical model R, the weight
w(n,m) (Xi , xi ) of arc (n, m) where Xi labels n and
xi labels m, is the combination (e.g.
product) of
all the functions in BT (Xi ) assigned by values along
the path to m, πm .
Formally, w(n,m) (Xi , xi ) =
⊗f ∈BT (Xi ) f (asgn(πm )[scope(f )]).
Figure 4 shows a belief network, a DFS tree that drives
its weighted AND/OR search tree, and a portion of the
AND/OR search tree with the appropriate weights on the
arcs expressed symbolically. In this case the bucket of E
contains the function P (E|A, B), and the bucket of C contains two functions, P (C|A) and P (D|B, C). Note that
P (D|B, C) belongs neither to the bucket of B nor to the
bucket of D, but it is contained in the bucket of C, which
is the last variable in its scope to be instantiated in a path
from the root of the pseudo tree.

AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagram
for Constraint Networks

Constraint networks have only binary valued functions. In
[13] we presented a compilation scheme for AOMDDs
for constraint networks based on the Variable Elimination
schedule. For completeness, we only provide below the
main ideas for constraint networks, and then present the
current contribution extending the AOMDD for weighted
graphical models.
The context minimal graph is a data structure that is equivalent to the given graphical model, in the sense that it represents the same set of solutions, and any query on the graphical model can be answered by inspecting the context minimal graph. Our goal is to shrink the context minimal graph
even further, by identifying mergeable nodes beyond those
based on context. Redundant nodes can also be identified
and removed.
Suppose we are given an AND/OR search graph (it could
also be a tree initially). The reduction rules of OBDDs are
also applicable to it, if we maintain the semantics. In particular, we have to detail the treatment of AND nodes and
OR nodes. If we consider only reduction by isomorphism,
then the AND/OR graph can be processed by ignoring the
AND or OR attributes of the nodes. If we consider reduction by redundancy, then it is useful to group each OR node

together with its AND children into a meta-node.
D EFINITION 8 (meta-node) A nonterminal meta-node v
in an AND/OR search graph consists of an OR node labeled
var(v) = Xi and its ki AND children labeled hXi , xi1 i,
. . . , hXi , xiki i that correspond to its value assignments.
We will sometimes abbreviate hXi , xij i, by xij . Each
AND node labeled xij points to a list of child meta-nodes,
u.childrenj .
Consider the pseudo tree in Figure 3(b). An example of
meta-node corresponding to variable A is given in Figure 5,
assuming three values. That is just a portion of an AND/OR
graph, where redundant meta-nodes were removed. For
A = 0, the child meta-node has variable B. For A = 1, B
is irrelevant so the corresponding meta-node was removed,
and there is an AND arc pointing to E and C. For A = 2,
both B and C are irrelevant. This example did not take into
account possible weights on the OR-AND arcs.

DA = . . . = DH = {0, 1} and the constraints (⊕ denotes
XOR): C1 = F ∨H, C2 = A∨¬H, C3 = A⊕B⊕G, C4 =
F ∨G, C5 = B∨F , C6 = A∨E, C7 = C∨E, C8 = C⊕D,
C9 = B ∨ C. The constraint graph is shown in Figure 6(a).

The processing continues in the same manner The final output of the algorithm, which coincides with m7 , is shown
in Figure 6(c). The OBDD based on the same ordering d
is shown in Fig. 6(d). Notice that the AOMDD has 18

We present the APPLY algorithm for combining AOMDDs
for constraints. It was shown in [13] that the complexity of
the APPLY is at most quadratic in the input.
In [13] it was shown that the time and space complexity
of the VE based compilation scheme is exponential in the

Consider the ordering d = (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H). The
pseudo tree induced by d is given in Fig. 6(a). Figure 6(b)
shows the execution of VE with AOMDDs along ordering
d. Initially, the constraints C1 through C9 are represented
as AOMDDs and placed in the bucket of their latest variable in d. Each original constraint is represented by an
AOMDD based on a chain. For bi-valued variables, they
are OBDDs, for multiple-valued they are MDDs (multivalued decision diagrams). Note that we depict metanodes: one OR node and its two AND children, that appear inside each larger square node. The dotted edge corresponds to the 0 value (the low edge in OBDDs), the solid
edge to the 1 value (the high edge). We have some redundancy in our notation, keeping both AND value nodes and
arc types (doted arcs from “0” and solid arcs from “1”).
The VE scheduling is used to process the buckets in reverse order of d. A bucket is processed by joining all the
AOMDDs inside it, using the APPLY operator (described
further). However, the step of eliminating the bucket variable will be omitted because we want to generate the full
AOMDD. In our example, the messages m1 = C1 ./ C2
and m2 = C3 ./ C4 are still based on chains, so they are
still OBDDs. Note that they still contain the variables H
and G, which have not been eliminated. However, the message m3 = C5 ./ m1 ./ m2 is not an OBDD anymore.
We can see that it follows the structure of the pseudo tree,

We describe here a search based approach for compiling
an AOMDD. Theorem 2 ensures that the context minimal
(CM) graph can be traversed by AND/OR search in time
∗
and space O(n k wT (G) ). When full caching is used, the
trace of AND/OR search (i.e., the AND/OR graph traversed
by the algorithm) is a subset of the CM graph (if pruning
techniques are used, some portions of the CM graph may
not be traversed). When the AND/OR search algorithm terminates, its trace is an AND/OR graph that expresses the
original graphical model. We can therefore apply the reduction rules (isomorphism and redundancy) to the trace of
the AND/OR search in a single bottom up pass, that has
complexity linear in the size of the trace. In fact, the reduction rules can be included in the depth first AND/OR
search algorithm itself: whenever the entire subgraph of a
meta-node has been visited, the algorithm can check for
isomorphism between the current node and metanodes of
the same variable, and also check redundancy, before the
search retracts to the parent meta-node. The end result
will be the AOMDD of the original graphical model. The
time and space complexity of this scheme is bounded in
the worst case by that of exploring the CM graph, which is
given in Theorem 2 (i.e., exponential in the treewidth of the
model). In Section 6 we provide preliminary evaluation of
the search based compilation.

AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagram
for Weighted Graphs

We will now describe an extension of AOMDDs to
weighted graphical models, which include probabilistic
graphical models. The functions defining the model can in
this case take arbitrary positive real values. The AND/OR
search space is well defined for such graphical models, and
in particular the context minimal graph is a decision diagram that represents the same function as the model. The

Figure 8: Normalizing values bottom up
reduction rules (merge isomorphic nodes and reduce redundant nodes) are also well defined for weighted models
(if we operate with meta-nodes), and guaranteed to produce equivalent decision diagrams. For example, isomorphic nodes should have the same variable, the same sets
of children, and the same weights on their respective ORAND arcs. If we start with the AND/OR tree and apply the
isomorphism rule exhaustively, we are guaranteed to obtain
a graph at least as compact as the context minimal graph.
This is because OR nodes that have the same context also
represent isomorphic meta-nodes when the isomorphic rule
was applied exhaustively to all the levels below.
However, the property of being a canonical representation
of a function is lost in the case of weighted graphs, if we
only use the usual reduction rules.
Figure 7(a) shows a weighted graphical model, defined by
two (cost) functions, f (M, A, B) and g(M, B, C). Assuming the order (M, A, B, C), Figure 7(b) shows the
AND/OR search tree. The arcs are labeled with function
values, and the leaves show the value of the corresponding full assignment (which is the product of numbers on
the arcs of the path). We can see that either value of M (0
or 1) gives rise to the same function (because the leaves in
the two subtrees have the same values). Therefore, the universal model of the conditioned subproblem for M = 0 is
identical to that for M = 1. However, the two subtrees can
not be identified as representing the same function by the
usual reduction rules, because of different weights on the
arcs. Figure 7(c) shows the context minimal graph, which

has a compact representation of each subtree, but does not
share any of their parts. In these figures we do not show the
contours of meta-nodes, to reduce clutter.
What we would like in this case is to have a method of
recognizing that the left and right subtrees corresponding to
M = 0 and M = 1 represent the same function. We do this
by normalizing the weights in each level, and processing
bottom up by promoting the normalization constant.
In Figure 8(a) the weights on the OR-AND arcs of level C
have been normalized, and the normalization constant was
promoted up to the OR node value. In Figure 8(b) the normalization constants are promoted upwards again by multiplication into the OR-AND weights. This process does
not change the value of each full assignment, and therefore
produces equivalent graphs. We can see now that some of
the C level (meta) nodes are mergeable. Continuing this
process gives the final AOMDD for the weighted model, in
Figure 8(c).
D EFINITION 9 (weighted AOMDD) A weighted AOMDD
is an AND/OR graph (with meta-nodes), where for each
OR node, the emanating OR-AND arcs have an associated
weight, such that their sum is 1, and the root meta-node
has a weight (the resulting normalization constant). The
terminal nodes are just 0 and 1.
The following theorem ensures the that the weighted
AOMDD is a canonical representation.

models that accept a common pseudo tree T , normalizing
arc values together with exhaustive application of reduction rules yields the same AND/OR graphs.
The proof is omitted here for space reasons. We only mention that the proof is by structural induction bottom up over
the layers of the AND/OR graph.
The APPLY algorithm needs minimal modifications now to
operate on weighted AOMDDs. The hash function H2 ,
which hashes meta-nodes, has to take as extra arguments
the weights of the meta-node. Similarly, when checking
redundancy in line 21, the weights should also be equal for
the node to be redundant, and their common value has to be
promoted by multiplication. When checking isomorphism
in line 23, the corresponding weights are checked via the
hash function H2 . The same VE schedule can now be used
to compile an AOMDD for a weighted graphical model.

Experimental Evaluation

Our experimental evaluation is in preliminary stages, but
the results we have are already encouraging. We ran the
search based compile algorithm, by recording the trace
of the AND/OR search, and then reducing the resulting
AND/OR graph bottom up. In these results we only applied
the reduction by isomorphism and still kept the redundant
meta-nodes.
Table 1 shows the results for 20 belief networks from 5
problem classes: medical diagnosis (CPCS), digital circuits (ISCAS), deterministic grid networks (GRID), genetic linkage analysis (LINKAGE) as well as relational belief networks (PRIMULA). For each network we chose randomly e variables and set their values as evidence. For each

query we recorded the compilation time in seconds, the
number of OR nodes in the context minimal graph explored
(#cm) and the size of the resulting AOMDD (#aomdd).
In addition, we also computed the compression ratio of the
AOMDD structure as ratio = #cm/#aomdd. We also
report the number of variables (n), domain size (d), induced
width (w∗ ), pseudo tree depth (h), as well as the percentage
of zero probability tuples (zeros (%)) for each test instance.
We see that in a few cases the compression ratio is significant (e.g., cpcs422b 16.67%, s386 7.64%). Our future work will include the reduction rule by redundancy, as
well as the compilation algorithm by Variable Elimination
schedule.

Conclusion and Discussion

We presented the new data structure of weighted AOMDD,
as a target for compilation of weighted graphical models.
It is based on AND/OR search spaces and Binary Decision Diagrams. We argue that the AOMDD has an intuitive
structure, and can easily be incorporated into other already
existing algorithm (e.g., join tree clustering). We provide
two compilation methods, one based on Variable Elimination and the other based on search, both being time and
space exponential in the treewidth of the graphical model.
The preliminary experimental evaluation is quite encouraging, and shows the potential of the new AOMDD data
structure.
Compiling graphical models into weighted AOMDDs also
extends decision diagrams for the computation of semiring valuations [18], from linear variable ordering into treebased partial ordering. This provides an improvement

284

MATEESCU & DECHTER

of the complexity guarantees to exponential in treewidth,
rather than pathwidth.
There are various lines of related research. We only mention here: deterministic decomposable negation normal
form (d-DNNF) [7]; case factor diagrams [14]; compilation of CSPs into tree-driven automata [10]; and the recent
work on compilation [16, 4]. We think that our framework
using AND/OR search graphs has a unifying quality that
helps make connections among seemingly different compilation techniques.
The approach of compiling graphical models into
AOMDDs may seem to go against the current trend in
model checking, which moves away from BDD-based algorithms into CSP/SAT based approaches. However, algorithms that are search-based and compiled data-structures
such as BDDs differ primarily by their choices of time vs
memory. When we move from regular OR search space to
an AND/OR search space the spectrum of algorithms available is improved for all time vs memory decisions. We believe that the AND/OR search space clarifies the available
choices and helps guide the user into making an informed
selection of the algorithm that would fit best the particular
query asked, the specific input function and the computational resources.
