the knowledge engineering issues we faced when building a
large multilayered BN.
To create a large multilevel, multivalued BN we took
advantage of a rich knowledge base, the Computer-based

inference. Netview is a flexible tool which can be used in
any BN that uses noisy-gates, and is described in section

5.1.
Like the Internist- 1 -derived B N, the CPCS BN uses leak
probabilities [Henrion 1988] to represent the chance of an
event occurring when all of its modeled causes are absent.

To construct the BN we converted the CPCS-PM knowledge
base to CommonLisp and then parsed it to create nodes. We
r e pr esented diseases and IPSs as four levels of severity in
the CPCS BN-absent, mild, moderate, and severe.
Predisposing factors of a disease or IPS node were
represented as that node's predecessors, and findings and
symptoms of a disease or IPS node as the successors for that
node. In addition to the findings, CPCS contained causal
links between disease and IPS frames, we converted these
links into arcs in the BN. Frequency weigh t s [Shwe,
Middleton et al. 1991] from the CPCS-PM ranged from 0 to

We generated the CPCS BN automatically, we did manual
consistency checking using domain knowledge to edit the
network. Because the CPCS-PM knowledge base was not
designed with probabilistic interpretations in mind, we had
to make numerous minor corrections to remove artifactual
nodes, to make node values consistent and to confinn that
only mutually exclusive values were contained within a
node.
The resultant network has 448 nodes and 908 arcs (Figure
1). A t o tal of seventy four of the nodes in the network are
predisposing factors and required prior p robab ilities the
remaining nodes required leak probabilities assessed for
each of their values. We thus had to assess over 560
probabilities to specify the network fully.

LEAKS

As in any other knowledge representation scheme, the BN
representation suffers from incompleteness, in that it

typically cannot model every possible case. A leak variable

can be used to enforce the closed-world assumption [Reiter
1978]. The leak variable represents the set of causes that
are not modeled explicitly.

A leak probability is assigned as

the probability that the effect will occur in the absence of

CPCS BN for viewing. Netview allows the user to view all

while the node

and predecessors of the selected node or nodes, resulting in
the subnetwork view shown in Figure 4 . Other options
include viewing nodes' Markov blanket, and immediate
successors or predecessors.
Netview uses a dynamic layout algorithm to display the
selected nodes. The knowledge engineer is able to move
rapidly between views by selecting nodes and choosing
viewing options, or by retrieving previously saved views.
Quickly viewing a node's predecessors allows rapid
assessment of leak probabilities.
In addition to subnetwork selection, Netview allows
semantic labeling of nodes, and filtering based on semantic

set of diseases we can generate a subnetwork including
only those diseases of interest and their associated findings,

against a subnetwork we don't require the system to
compute the posterior probabilities of diseases that we are
not interested in.

When a subnetwork is saved Netview updates the leak
probabilities to take into account the missing diseases. In
the CPCS BN the node hepatomegaly has parents shown in
figure 5, The leak probability for hepatomegaly is therefore
calculated based on this set of predecessors. In figure 4 a
subnetwork was selected based on the ancestors and
predecessors of the disease ascending-cholangitis. Conse­
quently, the only parent of hepatomegaly in the subnetwork
is ascending-cholangitis, its other parents are not included.
The transformation of leak probabilities required during
subnetwork creation is shown in Figure 6. The leak
probability must be updated from p to p'. This updating is
done in order to preserve the total probability mass. If the
value I of L is updated to a value l' for new leak L', we can
compute the updated leak node probability as

BN, and we are exploring how much the network
performance changes when the assumption is relaxed.
5.2.3 Information metrics

When subnetworks are created some information is lost as
parts of the network are excluded. A future area of research
is to use Netview to calculate the information Joss of a
subnetwork based on information metrics [Provan 1993],
and to compare differences in posterior probability between
the complete network and the subnetwork which has been
selected.

Based on the causal independence assumptions of the
noisy-MAX, and the use of leak probabilities we have
developed Netview, a tool for visualizing BNs based on the
dynamic layout of subnetworks, and which also provides
basic version control for editing networks. The creation of
subnetworks allows for more efficient knowledge
engineering, and for easier verification of the B N. We
describe a technique for updating leak probabilities based
on the excluded parents of a node in subnetworks.

Recent advances in creating BNs from pre-existing data or
knowledge bases will result in networks that are larger and
more complex than those created manually. We believe that
the techniques described in this paper are important to
facilitate the management and verification of such
networks.
