Abstract
In this paper, we develop a qualitative theory of
influence diagrams that can be used to model
and solve sequential decision making tasks when
only qualitative (or imprecise) information is
available. Our approach is based on an orderof-magnitude approximation of both probabilities and utilities and allows for specifying partially ordered preferences via sets of utility values. We also propose a dedicated variable elimination algorithm that can be applied for solving
order-of-magnitude influence diagrams.

INTRODUCTION

Influence diagrams have been widely used for the past three
decades as a graphical model to formulate and solve decision problems under uncertainty. The standard formulation
of an influence diagram consists of two types of information: qualitative information that defines the structure of
the problem eg, the set of (discrete) chance variables describing the set of possible world configurations, the set of
available decisions, as well as the dependencies between
the variables, and quantitative information (also known as
the parametric structure) that, together with the qualitative
information, defines the model. The parametric structure
is composed of the conditional probability distributions as
well as the utility functions describing the decision maker’s
preferences. In general, the solution to an influence diagram depends on both types of information. Quite often,
however, we may have precise knowledge of the qualitative
information but only very rough (or imprecise) estimates
of the quantitative parameters. In such cases, the standard
solution techniques cannot be applied directly, unless the
missing information is accounted for.
In this paper, we propose a qualitative theory for influence

diagrams in which such partially specified sequential decision problems can be modeled and solved. In particular, we
introduce the order-of-magnitude influence diagram model
that uses an order-of-magnitude representation of the probabilities and utilities. The model allows the decision maker
to specify partially ordered preferences via finite sets of
utility values. In this case, there will typically not be a
unique maximal value of the expected utility, but rather a
set of them. To compute this set and also the corresponding
decision policy we propose a dedicated variable elimination algorithm that performs efficient operations on sets of
utility values. Numerical experiments on selected classes
of influence diagrams show that as the quantitative information becomes more precise, the qualitative decision process becomes closer to the standard one.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives background on influence diagrams. In Section 3 we present
the order-of-magnitude calculus as a representation framework for imprecise probabilities and utilities. Sections 4
and 5 describe the main operations over sets of order-ofmagnitude values and introduce the order-of-magnitude influence diagram model. In Section 6 we present the results
of our empirical evaluation. Section 7 overviews related
work, while Section 8 provides concluding remarks.

INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS

An influence diagram is defined by a tuple hX, D, U, Gi,
where X = {X1 , . . . , Xn } is a set of oval-shaped nodes
labeled by the chance variables which specify the uncertain decision environment, D = {D1 , . . . , Dm } is a set of
rectangle-shaped nodes labeled by the decision variables
which specify the possible decisions to be made in the domain, U = {U1 , . . . , Ur } are diamond-shaped nodes labeled by the utility functions which represent the preferences of the decision maker, and G is a directed acyclic
graph containing all the nodes X ∪ D ∪ U. As in belief
networks, each chance variable Xi ∈ X is associated with
a conditional probability table (CPT) Pi = P (Xi |pa(Xi )),
where pa(Xi ) ⊆ X ∪ D \ {Xi } are the parents of Xi in

The wildcatter could do a seismic test that will help determine the geological structure of the site. The test results can
show a closed reflection pattern (indication of significant
oil), an open pattern (indication of some oil), or a diffuse
pattern (almost no hope of oil). The probabilistic knowledge consists of the CPTs P (O) and P (S|O, T ), while the
utility function is the sum of U1 (T ) and U2 (D, O). The optimal policy is to perform the seismic test and to drill only
if the test results show an open or a closed pattern. The
maximum expected utility of this policy is 42.75.

G. Similarly, each decision variable Dk ∈ D has a parent
set pa(Dk ) ⊆ X ∪ D \ {Dk } in G, denoting the variables
whose values will be known at the time of the decision and
may affect directly the decision. Non-forgetting is typically
assumed for an influence diagram, meaning that a decision
node and its parents are parents to all subsequent decisions.
Finally, each utility node Uj ∈ U is associated with a utility function that depends only on the parents pa(Uj ) of Uj .
The decision variables in an influence diagram are typically
assumed to be temporally ordered. Let D1 , D2 , ..., Dm be
the order in which the decisions are to be made. The chance
variables can be partitioned into a collection of disjoint sets
I0 , I1 , . . . , Im . For each k, where 0 < k < m, Ik is the
set of chance variables that are observed between Dk and
Dk+1 . I0 is the set of initial evidence variables that are
observed before the first D1 . Im is the set of chance variables left unobserved when the last decision Dm is made.
This induces a partial order ≺ over X ∪ D, as follows:
I0 ≺ D1 ≺ I1 ≺ · · · ≺ Dm ≺ Im [5].
A decision policy (or strategy) for an influence diagram is
a list of decision rules ∆ = (δ1 , . . . , δm ) consisting of one
rule for each decision variable. A decision rule for the decision Dk ∈ D is a mapping δk : Ωpa(Dk ) → ΩDk , where
for a set S ⊆ X ∪ D, ΩS is the Cartesian product of the
individual domains of the variables in S. Solving an influence diagram is to find the optimal decision policy that
maximizes the expected utility. The maximum expected
utility (MEU) is equal to:

Example 1 For illustration, consider the influence diagram displayed in Figure 1 which is based on the classic
oil wildcatter decision problem [9]. An oil wildcatter must
decide either to drill or not to drill for oil at a specific site.

Variable Elimination Several exact methods have been
proposed over the past decades for solving influence diagrams using local computations [10, 13, 11, 5, 3, 8]. These
methods adapted classical variable elimination techniques,
which compute a type of marginalization over a combination of local functions, in order to handle the multiple types
ofPinformation (probabilities and utilities), marginalization
( and max) and combination (× for probabilities, + for
utilities)
Pinvolved in influence diagrams. Since the alternation of and max in Eq. 1 does not commute in general, it
prevents the solution technique from eliminating variables
in any ordering. Therefore, the computation dictated by
Eq. 1 must be performed along a legal elimination ordering that respects ≺, namely the reverse of the elimination
ordering is some extension of ≺ to a total order [5, 3].

FOUNDATIONS

Our approach towards a qualitative theory for influence
diagrams is based on the qualitative decision theory proposed by Wilson [14]. Wilson’s theory defines a set of abstract quantities called extended reals, denoted by R∗ , that
are used to represent qualitative probabilities and utilities.
Each extended real is a rational function p/q where p and
q are polynomials in ǫ with coefficients in the rationals,
where ǫ is a very small but unknown quantity so that the
extended reals can be used to represent information up to ǫ
precision. For example, quantities such as 1−ǫ and ǫ might
be used for qualitative probabilities likely and unlikely respectively, and ǫ−1 for a high utility. These quantities can
then be combined using standard arithmetic operations between polynomials for computing expected qualitative utilities. The resulting utilities are then compared among each
other by means of a total order on R∗ that is defined in [14].
3.1

ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE CALCULUS

Rather than using extended reals explicitly, we adopt a simpler calculus that allows us to reason about the “order of
magnitude” of the extended reals [14]. We start with the
definition of an order-of-magnitude value that represents a
qualitative probability or utility value.
D EFINITION 1 An order-of-magnitude value is a pair

hσ, ni, where σ ∈ {+, −, ±} is called the sign and n ∈ Z
is called the order of magnitude, respectively.
Intuitively, for each integer n we have an element h+, ni
meaning “of order ǫn ”, and an element h−, ni meaning “of
order −ǫn ”. Moreover, if we add something of order ǫn
to something of order −ǫn then the result can be of order
±ǫm , for any m ≥ n. To ensure closure of the calculus
under addition, we therefore add the element h±, ni representing this set of possibilities. In the following, we also
define O = {hσ, ni | n ∈ Z, σ ∈ {+, −, ±}} ∪ {h±, ∞i},
O± = {h±, ni | n ∈ Z ∪ {∞}} and O+ = {h+, ni | n ∈
Z ∪ {∞}}. The element h±, ∞i will sometimes be written
as 0, element h+, 0i as 1, and element h−, 0i as -1.
Standard arithmetic operations such as multiplication (×)
and addition (+) follow from the semantics of the order-ofmagnitude values [14] and are defined next.
D EFINITION 2 (multiplication) Let a, b ∈ O be such that
a = hσ, mi and b = hτ, ni. We define a × b = hσ ⊗
τ, m + ni, where ∞ + n = n + ∞ = ∞ for n ∈ Z ∪ {∞}
and ⊗ is the natural multiplication of signs, namely it is the
commutative operation on {+, −, ±} such that +⊗− = −,
+ ⊗ + = − ⊗ − = +, and ∀σ ∈ {+, −, ±}, σ ⊗ ± = ±.
This multiplication is associative and commutative, and
∀a ∈ O, a × 0 = 0 and a × 1 = a, respectively. Furthermore, for b ∈ O \ O± , we define b−1 to be the multiplicative inverse of b, namely hσ, mi−1 = hσ, −mi for
σ ∈ {+, −}. Given a ∈ O, we define a/b = a × b−1 .
D EFINITION 3 (addition) Let a, b ∈ O be such that a =
hσ, mi and b = hτ, ni. We define a + b to be: (1) hσ, mi
if m < n; (2) hτ, ni if m > n; (3) hσ ⊕ τ, mi if m = n,
where + ⊕ + = +, − ⊕ − = −, and otherwise, σ ⊕ τ = ±.
Addition is associative and commutative, and a + 0 = a,
∀a ∈ O. For a, b ∈ O, let −b = −1 × b and a − b =
a+(−b). Clearly, we can write −hσ, mi = h−σ, mi, where
−(+) = −, −(−) = + and −(±) = ±. We also have the
distributivity: ∀a, b, c ∈ O, (a + b) × c = a × c + b × c.
3.2

ORDERING ON SETS OF
ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE VALUES

We will use the following ordering over the elements of O,
which is slightly stronger than that defined in [14].
D EFINITION 4 (ordering) Let a, b ∈ O be such that a =
hσ, mi and b = hτ, ni. We define the binary relation < on
O by a < b if and only if either: (1) σ = + and τ = +
and m ≤ n; or (2) σ = + and τ = ± and m ≤ n; or (3)
σ = + and τ = −; or (4) σ = ± and τ = − and m ≥ n;
or (5) σ = − and τ = − and m ≥ n.
Given a, b ∈ O, if a < b then we say that a dominates b.
For A, B ⊆ O, we say that A < B if every element of

B is dominated by some element of A (so that A contains
as least as large elements as B), namely if for all b ∈ B
there exists a ∈ A with a < b. As usual, we write a ≻ b
if and only if a < b and it is not the case that b < a. It is
easy to see that < is a partial order on O and the following
monotonicity property holds:
P ROPOSITION 1 Let a, b, c ∈ O. If a < b then a + c <
b + c, and if a < b and c ∈ O+ then a × c < b × c.
Any finite set of order-of-magnitude values can therefore
be represented by its maximal elements with respect to <.
D EFINITION 5 (maximal set) Given a finite set A ⊆ O,
we define the maximal set of A, denoted by max< (A), to be
the set consisting of the undominated elements in A, namely
max< (A) = {a ∈ A | ∄b ∈ A such that b ≻ a}.

4

OPERATIONS ON SETS OF
ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE VALUES

We introduce now the main operations that can be performed over partially ordered finite sets of order-ofmagnitude values. In particular, we extend the addition (+)
and multiplication (×) operations from singleton to sets of
order-of-magnitude values as well as define a maximization
operation over such sets.
4.1

ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION AND
MAXIMIZATION

Given two finite sets A, B ⊆ O and q ∈ O+ , we define
the summation and multiplication operations as A + B =
{a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} and q × A = {q × a | a ∈
A}, respectively. The maximization operation is defined
by max(A, B) = max< (A ∪ B).
In order to use the order-of-magnitude calculus to define
a qualitative version of influence diagrams we need to be
sure that each of +, × and max is commutative and associative, and also to give sufficient conditions such that the
following distributivity properties hold:
∀q, q1 , q2 ∈ O+ and ∀A, B, C ⊆ O
D1 q × (A + B) = (q × A) + (q × B)
D2 (q1 + q2 ) × A = (q1 × A) + (q2 × A)
D3 max(A, B) + C = max(A, C) + max(B, C)
It is easy to see that +, × and max are commutative and
associative, and the distributivity properties (D1) and (D3)
hold as well. Unfortunately, the distributivity property (D2)
does not always hold for sets of order-of-magnitude values.
To give a simple example, let q1 = h+, 2i, q2 = h+, 3i and
let A = {h±, 1i, h±, 4i}. Then, (q1 + q2 ) × A yields the set

{h±, 3i, h±, 6i}, whereas (q1 × A) + (q2 × A) is equal to
{h±, 3i, h±, 4i, h±, 6i}. This property does however hold
for convex sets, as we will show next.

We can show now that any finite subset of O is in fact ≡equivalent with a set of order-of-magnitude values containing one or two elements, namely:

4.2

T HEOREM 1 Let A be any finite subset of O. Then either
A ≡ {a} for some a ∈ O, or ∃ m, n ∈ Z with m < n and
σ ∈ {+, −, ±} such that A ≡ {h±, mi, hσ, ni}.

CONVEX SETS AND CONVEX CLOSURE

Based on Definition 5, every element of a finite set A ⊆
O is dominated by some maximal element in A. We can
therefore define an equivalence relation between finite sets
of order-of-magnitude values, as follows.
D EFINITION 6 (relation ≈) Given two finite sets A, B ⊆
O, we say that A is ≈-equivalent with B, denoted by A ≈
B, if and only if A < B and B < A.
Clearly, ≈ is an equivalence relation, namely it is reflexive,
symmetric and transitive. We then have that:
P ROPOSITION 2 Let A, B, C ⊆ O be finite sets and let
q ∈ O+ . The following properties hold: (1) A ≈ B if
and only if max< (A) = max< (B); (2) if A ≈ B then
A + C ≈ B + C and q × A ≈ q × B.
We introduce next the notions of convex sets and convex
closure of sets of order-of-magnitude values.
D EFINITION 7 A set A ⊆ O is said to be convex if
∀q1 , q2 ∈ O+ with q1 + q2 = 1, and ∀a, b ∈ A, we have
that (q1 × a) + (q2 × b) ∈ A. The convex closure C(A)
of a set AP⊆ O is defined to consist of every element of
k
the form i=1 (qi × ai ), where k is an arbitrary natural
Pk
number, each ai ∈ A, each qi ∈ O+ and i=1 qi = 1.
Consider two elements hσ, mi and hτ, ni in O, where we
can assume without loss of generality that m ≤ n. Any
convex combination of these two elements is of the form
hθ, li where l ∈ [m, n] and if l < n then θ = σ; if l = n
then θ = σ ⊕τ or θ = τ . This implies that the convex combination of a finite number of non-zero elements is finite
(since every element a in the convex combination has its
order restricted to be within a finite range), and so, in particular can be represented by its maximal set. In fact, this
property holds even if we allow the zero element h±, ∞i.
We can define now the following equivalence relation:
D EFINITION 8 (relation ≡) Given the finite sets A, B ⊆
O, we say that A is ≡-equivalent with B, denoted by A ≡
B, if and only if C(A) ≈ C(B).
Therefore, two sets of order-of-magnitude values are considered equivalent if, for every convex combination of elements of one, there is a convex combination of elements of
the other which is at least as good.
P ROPOSITION 3 Let A, B, C ⊆ O be finite sets and let
q ∈ O+ . The following properties hold: (1) A ≡ B if and
only if max< (C(A)) = max< (C(B)); (2) if A ≡ B then
A + C ≡ B + C, q × A ≡ q × B, and A ∪ C ≡ B ∪ C.

4.3

OPERATIONS ON EQUIVALENT SETS OF
ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE VALUES

Theorem 1 allows us to efficiently perform the required
operations (ie, summation, multiplication and maximization) on sets of order-of-magnitude values. We assume that
the subsets O are either singleton sets or are of the form
{h±, mi, hσ, ni}, where m < n. We need to ensure that
the outputs are of this form as well. For a given a ∈ O, we
use the notation σ(a) and â to denote the sign and the order
of magnitude of a, respectively,
Multiplication Given A ⊆ O of the required form, and
q ∈ O+ , we need to generate a set A′ that is ≡-equivalent
with q × A. Write q as h+, li. If A = {hσ, mi} then q × A
is just equal to the singleton set {hσ, l + mi}. Otherwise, A
is of the form {h±, mi, hσ, ni}, where m < n. Then q × A
equals {h±, l + mi, hσ, l + ni}, which is of the required
form, since l + m < l + n.
Maximization Given the sets A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak ⊆ O, each
of them having the required form, we want to compute
a set A′ that is ≡-equivalent to max(A1 , . . . , Ak ). Let
A = A1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ak and, for σ ∈ {+, −, ±}, we define
mσ and nσ as follows: if there exists no element a ∈ A
with σ(a) = σ then we say that mσ and nσ are both undefined; otherwise we have that mσ = min{l : hσ, li ∈ A}
and nσ = max{l : hσ, li ∈ A}, respectively. The set A′ is
computed as follows: (1) if m+ and m± are both undefined
(there are only negative elements) then A′ = {h−, n− i};
(2) if m+ is defined and either m+ ≤ m± or m± is undefined then A′ = {h+, m+ i}; (3) if m+ > m± (and both
are defined) then A′ = {h±, m± i, h+, m+ i}; (4) if m+
is undefined (no positive elements) and either n± ≥ n−
or n− is undefined then A′ = {h±, m± i, h±, n± i} ; and
(5) if m+ is undefined (there are no positive elements) and
n± < n− then A′ = {h±, m± i, h−, n− i}.
Summation Given the sets A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak ⊆ O of required form as before, we want to compute a set A′ that
is ≡-equivalent to (A1 + · · · + Ak ). We can write Ai as
{ai , bi } where if ai 6= bi then σ(ai ) = ± and âi < b̂i .
Then, (A1 + · · · + Ak ) ≡ {a, b} where a = a1 + · · · + ak
and b = b1 + · · · + bk . We can write b more explicitly
as hσ(b), b̂i where b̂ = min(b̂1 , . . . , b̂k ), and σ(b) = + if
and only if all bi with minimum b̂i have σ(bi ) = +; else
σ(b) = − if all bi with minimum b̂i have σ(bi ) = −; else
σ(b) = ±. Similarly for a. If σ(a) 6= ± then {a, b} reduces
to a singleton because a = b.

Example 2 Consider the sets A1 = {h±, 3i, h±, 4i} and
A2 = {h±, 3i, h±, 6i}. To generate A′ ≡ max(A1 , A2 ),
we first compute m± = 3 and n± = 6, and then we have
that A′ = {h±, 3i, h±, 6i} which corresponds to the extreme points of the input sets. Similarly, we can compute
the set A′′ ≡ (A1 + A2 ) as {h±, 3i, h±, 4i}.
4.4

DISTRIBUTIVITY PROPERTIES REVISITED

In summary, we can show now that all three distributivity
properties hold with respect to the ≡-equivalence relation
between finite sets of order-of-magnitude values.
T HEOREM 2 ∀q, q1 , q2 ∈ O+ and ∀A, B, C ⊆ O finite
sets we have that: (D1) q × (A + B) ≡ (q × A) + (q × B);
and (D2) (q1 + q2 ) × A ≡ (q1 × A) + (q2 × A); and (D3)
max(A, B) + C ≡ max(A, C) + max(B, C).

THE QUALITATIVE DECISION MODEL

An order-of-magnitude influence diagram (OOM-ID) is a
qualitative counterpart of the standard influence diagram
graphical model. The graphical structure of an OOM-ID
is identical to that of a standard ID, namely it is a directed
acyclic graph containing chance nodes (circles) for the random discrete variables X, decision nodes (rectangles) for
the decision variables D, and utility nodes (diamonds) for
the local utility functions U of the decision maker. The
directed arcs in the OOM-ID represent the same dependencies between the variables as in the standard model. Each
chance node Xi ∈ X is associated with a conditional probability distribution Pio that maps every configuration of its
scope to a positive order-of-magnitude probability value,
namely Pio : ΩXi ∪pa(Xi ) → O+ . The utility functions
Ujo ∈ U represent partially ordered preferences which
are expressed by finite sets of order-of-magnitude values,
namely Ujo : ΩQj → 2O , where Qj is the scope of Uj .
Solving an order-of-magnitude influence diagram is to find
the optimal policy ∆ = (δ1 , . . . , δmQ) that maximizes
Pr the
n
order-of-magnitude expected utility i=1 Pio × j=1 Ujo .
We define the optimal policies set of an order-of-magnitude
influence diagram to be the set of all policies having the
same maximum order-of-magnitude expected utility.
5.2

Figure 2: Order-of-magnitude probability and utility functions corresponding to the oil wildcatter influence diagram.

AN EXAMPLE

Figure 2 displays the order-of-magnitude probability and
utility functions of an OOM-ID corresponding to the oil

wildcatter decision problem from Example 1. For our
purpose, we used an extension of Spohn’s mapping from
the original probability distributions and utility functions
to their corresponding order-of-magnitude approximation
[12, 2]. Specifically, given a small positive ǫ < 1, the
order-of-magnitude approximation of a probability value
p ∈ (0, 1] is h+, ki such that k ∈ Z and ǫk+1 < p ≤ ǫk ,
while the order-of-magnitude approximation of a positive
utility value u > 0 is h+, −ki such that ǫ−k ≤ u <
ǫ−(k+1) (the case of negative utilities is symmetric). For
example, if we consider ǫ = 0.1 then the probability
P (S = closed|O = dry, T = yes) = 0.01 is mapped to
h+, 2i, while the utilities U2 (O = dry, D = yes) = −70
and U2 (O = soaking, D = yes) = 200 are mapped to
h−, −1i and h+, −2i, respectively.
Table 1 shows the optimal policies sets (including the maximum order-of-magnitude expected utility) obtained for
the order-of-magnitude influence diagrams corresponding
to ǫ ∈ {0.1, 0.01, 0.001}. When ǫ = 0.1, we can see
that there are two optimal policies having the same maximum order-of-magnitude expected utility, namely ∆1 (for
T = yes) and ∆2 (for T = no). Therefore, if the seismic
test is performed (T = yes) then drilling is to be done only
if the test results show an open or closed pattern. Otherwise
(T = no), the wildcatter will drill regardless of the test results. Ties like these at the decision variables are expected
given that the order-of-magnitude probabilities and utilities
represent abstractions of the real values. The expected utilities of ∆1 and ∆2 in the original influence diagram are

42.75 and 20.00, respectively.

Algorithm 1: ELIM-OOM-ID

When ǫ = 0.01, we also see that both drilling options are
equally possible if the seismic test is performed and the
test results show a diffuse pattern. In this case, there are
four optimal policies having the same maximum order-ofmagnitude expected utility. Finally, when ǫ = 0.001, we
can see that all decision options are possible and the corresponding optimal policies set contains 128 policies. The
explanation is that the order-of-magnitude influence diagram contains in this case only trivial order-of-magnitude
values such as h+, 0i, h−, 0i and h+, ∞i, respectively.

VARIABLE ELIMINATION

Theorem 2 ensures the soundness and correctness of a variable elimination procedure using the summation (+), multiplication (×) and maximization (max) operations over
partially ordered sets of order-of-magnitude values, for
solving order-of-magnitude influence diagrams.
Therefore, a variable elimination algorithm that computes
the optimal policy of an order-of-magnitude influence diagram (and also the maximum order-of-magnitude expected
utility) is described by Algorithm 1. The algorithm, called
ELIM-OOM-ID, is based on Dechter’s bucket elimination
framework for standard influence diagrams [3] and uses a
bucket structure constructed along a legal elimination ordering o = Y1 , . . . Yt of the variables in X ∪ D. The bucket
data-structure, called buckets, associates each bucket with
a single variable. The bucket of Yp contains all input probability and utility functions whose highest variable is Yp .
The algorithm processes each bucket, top-down from the
last to the first, by a variable elimination procedure that
computes new probability (denoted by λ) and utility (denoted by θ) components which are then placed in corresponding lower buckets (lines 1–11). The λp of a chance
bucket is generated by multiplying all probability components and eliminating by summation the bucket variable.
The θp of a chance bucket is computed as the average utility of the bucket, normalized by the bucket’s compiled λp .
For a decision variable, we compute the λp and θp components in a similar manner and eliminate the bucket variable
by maximization. In this case, the product of the probability components in the bucket is a constant when viewed
as a function of the bucket’s decision variable [5, 15] and
therefore, the compiled λp is a constant as well.
In the second, bottom-up phase, the algorithm computes an
optimal policy. The decision buckets are processed in reverse order, from the first variable to the last. Each decision
rule is generated by taking the argument of the maximization operator applied over the combination of the probability and utility components in the respective bucket, for each
configuration of the variables in the bucket’s scope (ie, the
union of the scopes of all functions in that bucket minus the

EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we evaluate empirically the quality of the
decision policies obtained for order-of-magnitude influence
diagrams. All experiments were carried out on a 2.4GHz
quad-core processor with 8GB of RAM.
Methodology We experimented with random influence
diagrams described by the parameters hnc , nd , k, p, r, ai,
where nc is the number of chance variables, nd is the number of decision variables, k is the maximum domain size,
p is the number of parents in the graph for each variable, r
is the number of root nodes and a is the arity of the utility
functions. The structure of the influence diagram is created
by randomly picking nc + nd − r variables out of nc + nd
and, for each, selecting p parents from their preceding variables, relative to some ordering, whilst ensuring that the
decision variables are connected by a directed path. A single utility node with a parents picked randomly from the
chance and decision nodes is then added to the graph.
We generated two classes of random problems with parameters hn, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5i and having either positive utilities
only or mixed (positive and negative) utilities. They are

denoted by P : hn, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5i and M : hn, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5i,
respectively. In each case, 75% of the chance nodes were
assigned extreme CPTs which were populated with numbers drawn uniformly at random between 10−5 and 10−4 ,
whilst ensuring that the table is normalized. The remaining
CPTs were randomly filled using a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. For class P , the utilities are of the form 10u ,
where u is an integer uniformly distributed between 0 and
5. For class M , the utilities are of the form +10u or −10u ,
where u is between 0 and 5, as before, and we have an
equal number of positive and negative utility values. Each
influence diagram instance was then converted into a corresponding order-of-magnitude influence diagram using the
mapping of the probabilities and utilities described in Section 5.2, for some ǫ < 1. Intuitively, the smaller ǫ is, the
coarser the order-of-magnitude approximation of the exact
probability and utility values (ie, more information is lost).

Results Figure 3 displays the distribution of the relative
errors ηmed (top) and ηmax (bottom) obtained on orderof-magnitude influence diagrams derived from class P (ie,
positive utilities), as a function of the problem size (given
by the number of variables), for ǫ ∈ {0.5, 0.05, 0.005}.
Each data point and corresponding error bar represents the
25th , median and 75th percentiles obtained over 30 random problem instances generated for the respective problem size. We can see that ηmed is the smallest (less than
10%) for ǫ = 0.5. However, as ǫ decreases, the loss of
information due to the order-of-magnitude abstraction increases and the corresponding relative errors ηmed increase
significantly. Notice that the best policy ∆max derived
from the order-of-magnitude influence diagram was almost
identical to that of the corresponding standard influence diagram, for all ǫ (ie, the error ηmax is virtually zero).
Figure 4 shows the distribution of ηmed (top) and ηmax
(bottom) obtained on order-of-magnitude influence diagrams from class M (ie, mixed utilities). The pattern of
the results is similar to that from the previous case. However, in this case, the errors span over two or three orders of

Measures of Performance To measure how close the decision policies derived from the optimal policy set of an
order-of-magnitude influence diagram are to the optimal
policy of the corresponding standard influence diagram, we
use two relative errors, defined as follows. Let I be an influence diagram and let Iǫ be the corresponding order-ofmagnitude approximation, for some ǫ value. We sample s
different policies, uniformly at random, from the optimal
policies set of Iǫ , and for each sampled policy we compute
its expected utility in I. Let ∆med be a policy corresponding to the median expected utility vmed amongst the samples. We define the relative error ηmed = |(v − vmed )/v|,
where v is the maximum expected utility of the optimal
policy in I. Similarly, we define ηmax = |(v − vmax )/v|,
where ∆max is the best policy having the highest expected
utility vmax amongst the samples.

magnitude, especially for ǫ = 0.05 and 0.005. This is because the sampled policy space includes policies which are
quite different from each other and, although they have the
same maximum order-of-magnitude expected utility, their
expected utility in the corresponding standard influence diagram is significantly different. For this reason, we looked
in more detail at the distribution of the expected utility values of 100 policies sampled uniformly at random from the
optimal policies set of a class M OOM-ID instance with
45 variables, for ǫ ∈ {0.5, 0.05, 0.005}. As expected, we
observed that the smallest sample variance is obtained for
ǫ = 0.5. For ǫ = 0.05 and ǫ = 0.005, the samples are
spread out even more from the mean, and the variance of
the expected utility is significantly larger. This explains the
large variations of the relative errors ηmed and ηmax , especially for smaller ǫ values (eg, ǫ = 0.05 and ǫ = 0.005).

RELATED WORK

Several extensions of the standard influence diagram model
have been proposed in recent years to deal with imprecise
probabilistic and utility information. Garcia and Sabbadin
[4] introduced possibilistic influence diagrams to model
and solve decision making problems under qualitative uncertainty in the framework of possibilistic theory. Pralet et
al [8] considered a generalized influence diagram system

to be used together with totally ordered utility values only.
Lopez and Rodriguez [7] proposed an influence diagram
model based on random fuzzy variables to represent imprecise information. Kikuti et al [6] allow credal sets of
probabilities to represent imprecise probabilistic information and focus on precise utility. The work that is closest to
ours is that by Bonet and Pearl [1] who consider qualitative
MDPs and POMDPs based also on an order-of-magnitude
approximation of probabilities and totally ordered utilities.

CONCLUSION

The paper presents a qualitative influence diagram formalism that allows reasoning with imprecise probabilities and
partially ordered imprecise utility values. Our proposed
order-of-magnitude influence diagram model is based on an
order-of-magnitude representation of the probabilities and
utilities. We also described a dedicated variable elimination
algorithm that performs efficient operations on partially ordered sets of utilities for solving this model.
We considered a straightforward variable elimination algorithm. One way to improve it is to efficiently exploit
constraints (zero values of the uncertainty and utility functions), building, for instance, on work by [8]. We also plan
to investigate other formalisms for reasoning with imprecise information, such as interval-valued utilities and multi-
