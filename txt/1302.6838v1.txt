Abstract

This paper compares three approaches to the
problem of selecting among probability models
to fit data: (1) use of statistical criteria such as
Akaike's information criterion and Schwarz's
"Bayesian i nformation criterion," (2)
maximization of the posterior probability of the
model, and (3) maximization of an "effectiveness
ratio" trading off accuracy and computational
cost.
The unifying characteristic of the
approaches is that all can be viewed as
maximizing a penalized likelihood function. The
second approach with suitable prior distributions
has been shown to reduce to the first. This paper
shows that the third approach reduces to the
second for a particular form of the effectiveness
ratio, and illustrates all three approaches with the
problem of selecting the number of components
in a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Unlike
the first two approaches, the third can be used
even when the candidate models are chosen for
computational efficiency, without regard to
physical interpretation, so that the likelihoods
and the prior distribution over models cannot be
interpreted literally. As the most general and
computationally oriented of the approaches, it is
especially useful for artificial intelligence
applications.

INTRODUCTION

The model selection problem is to select from a candidate
set of models the one that fits the input data the "best" in
some sense. There is a large body of literature on model
selection; see for example Fourth International Workshop
on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics [1993], for which
model selection was the primary theme, and Ljung (1987].
This paper considers only approaches that can be
interpreted as maximizing a penalized likelihood function,
ignoring other important approaches such as Laplace
approximation of the posterior probabilities of models
[Kass and Raftery 1993] and minimum description length

criteria [Rissanen 1985]. Also, this paper emphasizes the
case that the candidate models fonn a sequence of nested
(successively more general) parametric, continuous
probability distributions with increasing numbers of
parameters. An example of such a sequence, used
throughout, is the sequence of mixtures of Gaussian
distributions (Gaussian mixtures) with increasing numbers
of components, starting with one component. A mixture
distribution with m continuous components has a density
of the fonn
f(x)"" Pl f1(x ) +

... +

Pm fm(x)

(1)

where Pl· ... , Pm are positive numbers summing to one
and f1 (x), ... , fm(x) are the component densities. Mixtures
of analytically tractable component distributions, such as
Gaussians, are useful to model not only true mixtures but
any continuous probability distributions with which fast
calculations are desirable [Poland 1994].
Section 2 reviews a class of large-sample statistical
criteria for model selection, sometimes called generalized
information criteria. Based on limiting properties of the
maximum likelihood as the sample size increases, these
criteria specify maximization of the log-likelihood of the
sample, less a penalty increasing in the number of
independent model parameters. The log-likelihood for
each model is evaluated at the maximum-likelihood
estimates of the model's parameters. The criteria include
the well-known Akaike's infonnation criterion (AIC) and
Schwarz's "Bayesian information criterion" (BIC). Stone
[1977] showed that the AIC is asymptotically equivalent
under certain conditions to model choice by cross­
validation, which evaluates the likelihood of each sample
point based on all other points rather than all points. The
BIC assumes unspecified priors for the parameters
meeting some weak conditions, and is similar in effect to
the minimum description length principle, which requires
minimizing the number of bits of information needed to
represent the data [Sclove 1993).
Unfortunately, mixture distributions with a fmite number
of components do not meet the regularity conditions
assumed in the expansions used to derive these criteria

Three A pproaches to Probability Model Selection

[Sclove 1993, Titterington et al. 1985]. However, this
problem can be avoided in practice, and Sclove reported
that the criteria have met with good success in estimating
the number of components of a mixture. This is to be
expected given their equivalence, under some conditions,
to the approaches of Sections 3 and 4.
Section 3 presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
approach to model selection: to specify a prior distribution
over the candidate models and then select the most
probable model posterior to the data. This is a practical
simplification of a full-fledged Bayesian approach, which
would keep all the candidate models weighted by their
posterior probabilities. Section 3 also re-derives the
equivalence, noted by Sclove [1993], of the MAP
approach with suitable prior distributions to the statistical
criteria approach.
Section 4 presents a third approach: to maximize the ratio
of the likelihood of the data, as an accuracy measure, to a
computational cost measure that increases with the
number of model parameters [Poland and Shachter 1993].
For a certain form of the cost function, this approach is
shown to be equivalent to the MAP approach. However,
for another, reasonable fonn of the cost function, it
always applies a smaller penalty for sufficiently many
parameters.
This effectiveness ratio has the advantage of remaining
easy to interpret in the common situation that the
candidate models are not believed to be literally correct or
representative, so that the likelihoods, and the prior for the
MAP approach, cannot be interpreted literally. For
example, the candidate models might be given a simple
parametric form only to allow efficient computations, as
long as the computations do not depend on this internal
form. A second. related advantage of the approach is that
it allows a continuous distribution rather than a sample as
the input data: that is, given the correct continuous
distribution, the model selection process can find a more
computationally convenient representation. In this case,
the accuracy measure must be generalized from a
likelihood to a function of the relative entropy from the
input distribution to the modeled distribution. Relative
e�tropy, also known as Kullback-Leibler number, directed
dtvergence, cross-entropy, etc., is a directed measure of
the divergence between two continuous or two discrete
probability distributions; see Shore [1986] and Whittaker
[1990]. Poland and Shachter [1993] used this approach to
fit Gaussian mixture distributions to arbitrary continuous
input distributions. The EM (expectation-maximization)
algorithm determined the p arameters that minimize the
relative entropy for any given number of components;
then maximization of the effectiveness ratio determined
the appropriate number of components .
Section 5 presents a heuristic to simplify the search for the
best model, and compares the results of all three
approaches in a mixture selection example. Section 6
concludes that the effectiveness ratio approach can be
especiall Y useful in artificial intelligence applications,
.
because It accounts for computational cost explicitly and

479

does not require belief in the validity of one of the
candidate models.

SOME STATISTICAL CRITERIA FOR
MODEL SELECTION

A class of statistical criteria for model selection, given a
large sample x = (x t .. , xn), has the form
.

�

ar� max
m-1,2,...

.

(2)
[ln ��( ) - c(n) v(m) ]
where m indexes the candidate models, {'!�(x) is the
=

x

likelihood for model m with maximum-likelihood
parameters, c(n) is a quantity depending only on n and the
criterion, and v(m) is the number of independent
parameters in model m. For example, \i(m) = 3m - 1 for a
Gaussian mixture with m univariate components, because
each component bas an associated weight, mean, and
variance, and the weights (which are probabilities) are
constrained to sum to one. The AIC sets c(n) = 1, whereas
the BIC sets c(n) = 1/2 In n. Therefore the BIC favors
smaller models than the AIC for lh Inn> l, or n � 8.
For successive nested models, the likelihood function
must be nondecreasing, because it is a maximum over
successively more general models. Therefore the second
term of (2) is needed to limit the size of the selected
model, and it can be viewed as a penalty for the model
size .
3

A MAP APPROACH

A full-fledged Bayesian approach to the problem of model
selection is not to select any single model, but to specify a
prior distribution over a mutuaiiy exclusive and
collectively exhaustive set of models, and to update this
with the data. (Thus the prior and posterior distributions
for the uncertain model would be mixture distributions,
but should not be confused with the models when they are
themselves mixture distributions.) All models with
nonzero posterior probability would be used in subsequent
analysis. This is of course impractical, so a common
alternative is to select a single model with maximum a
posteriori (MAP) probability. (See Draper [1993] for a
case for compromising between retaining all models and
selecting the single most probable model.)
Typically, each model has some uncertain parameters. A
statistical approach to this intra-model uncertainty begins
by e�pressing the probability of the data given a model as
an mtegral, over the model's parameters, of this
probability given the parameters times the probability of
the parameters given the model. Then large-sample
Laplace approximations of this integral lead to criteria
�uch as the BIC [Draper 1993]. A simpler approach to
mtra-model uncertainty is taken here, which does not
require a large sample: just as we select the MAP model,
we select the MAP parameters for each model. For
example, MAP estimates of the parameters of a Gaussian
mixture distribution with a given number of components

480

Poland and Shachter

can be found by the EM algorithm for maximum­
likelihood estimation, augmented with simple priors for
the component parameters [Hamilton 1991]. (Note that
MAP estimation of the parameters reduces to maximum­
likelihood estimation when the joint prior distribution for
the parameters is uniform over the region of interest.)
When the candidate models are nested, as for mixtures of
one or more Gaussians, they will not be mutually
exclusive, as assumed for the specification of the prior
distribution over models. However, the models will be
mutually exclusive after MAP selection of their
parameters, except in the rare case that the MAP
parameters of two models match. In this case one of the
models can be dropped and its probability added into that
of the other model.

A convenient choice for the prior distribution over the
candidate models, when they can be indexed by the
counting numbers, is the geometric distribution, the
discrete analog of the exponential distribution:
P(M= m) = Pl (1 - Pl)m-l , m = 1, 2,

···

(3)

where Pl is the probability that m is one. This makes
successively larger models less probable by a constant
factor. As Pt approaches zero, the geometric distribution
approaches an improper uniform distribution over the
counting numbers, which conveniently makes MAP
estimation reduce to maximum-likelihood estimation.
Thus, the parameter of the geometric distribution gives
full control over the rate that the probabilities of
successive models decrease.
The MAP model maximizes the product of the prior and
the likelihood.

Letting

{!f (x) be the likelihood for

model m with MAP parameters, this maximization with a
geometric prior over models is
"

m
m= 1,2,...
=

[ (!fcx)- ( In 1 �P) m ] .

ar! max In
m-1,2, ...

(4)

As in (2), the second term can be viewed as a penalty for
the model size. In fact, comparison of (4) and (2) shows
that the MAP approach with the geometric prior on
models becomes equivalent to the statistical criteria
approach when (i) the joint prior for the parameters of
each model is uniform over the region of interest, so that

(rnf(x) is the same as f!�(x), and (ii) {ln[l/(1- Pt)] }m
is equal to c(n)v(m), except for terms independent of m
that would not affect the maximization.
Letting v'(m) represent v(m) less any terms independent
of m, this second requirement gives
Pt = 1

_

e-c(n) v'(m) I m .

(5)

Gaussian mixtures have v'(m) = 3m. Therefore, for
Gaussian mixtures the AIC, for which c(n) =1, effectively
sets P1 =1 - e-3 0.95, while the BIC, for which c(n) =
=

lJ2ln n, effectively sets p1 = 1- n-3/2, which is 0.999 for
n = 100, for example. Thus the AIC and BIC applied to
nested probability models have the same effect as MAP
estimation with very high probabilities for the smallest
models, despite the differences in the origins of the
approaches. If the prior distribution over models were
more complicated than the geometric-for example, with
a mode after the smallest model-we might still expect
geometric tail behavior and thus obtain similar
correspondences for large enough models.
4

AN EFFECTIVENESS RATIO
APPROACH

A third approach to probability model selection is to
maximize an "effectiveness ratio": the likelihood for each
model, as an accuracy measure, divided by a
computational cost measure. (Similar objectives are
useful in search problems; see Simon and Kadane [1975]
for an example.) The parameters of each model can be
maximum-likelihood or other estimates, as long as the
"

resulting accuracy measure is useful. Letting f(m)(X)
represent the estimated likelihood and g(m) represent the
cost measure for model m, this approach seeks
"

"

m = arg max [ f (m)(x) I g(m)]
m= 1,2,...
"

= arg max [In f(m)(x) -In g(m)].
m;;:; 1,2, ...

(6)

For nested models the cost measure can be viewed as a
size penalty. One possibility is g(m) =a km, where a is a
positive constant that need not be assessed and k is a
parameter greater than one. Comparing (6) with (4)
shows that maximizing the effectiveness ratio with this
cost measure, and with MAP estimates of the model
parameters, is equivalent to the MAP approach with a
geometric(pi) prior such that Pl "' 1 - 1/k. Conversely,
the MAP approach with a geometric(p1) prior can be
viewed as maximizing an effectiveness ratio with cost
proportional to [11(1 - Pt)lm, and with MAP estimates of
the model parameters.
Another reasonable cost measure, used in the example in
the next section, is g(m) = a mk, where again a is a
positive constant that need not be assessed, and k is a
positive parameter. A possible s etting for k in a
probability problem with only discrete (including
discretized) and mixture variables is the total number of
variables in the problem; then mk is the worst-case
number of combinations of possible discrete outcomes
and mixture components needed to analyze the problem,
if all variables have the same number, m, of possible
outcomes or components. With this cost function, (6)
becomes
"

"

m"' arg max [In f(m)Cx)- k ln m] .
m= 1,2,

Three Approaches to Probability M o del Selection

In two important cases, effectiveness ratio maximization
remains straightforward to interpret when the other

approaches do not. First, we may not believe any of the
candidate models, having chosen them only for analytical

convenience. Then the likelihoods and prior used in the

flrst two approaches have no literal meaning, but the
likelihoods can still serve as accuracy measures in the
effectiveness ratios. Second, we might want to select and
fit an approximate model to a given continuous input
distribution, rather than select and estimate a model from

a given sample. Then a natural choice of accuracy
measure is a generalization of the log-likelihood for an
exchangeable sample, in terms of the relative entropy
from tlle input distribution to tlle model distribution. The
rest of this section derives this generalization [Kullback
1968, Titterington et al. 1985] and applies it to (6).

The relative enJropy from a continuous random variable X
to another continuous random variable Y can be defined
as an expectation over X:

D(X,Y) = E{ In[ fx(X) I fy(X)] }

ln[ fx(x) I fy(x) ] fx(x) dx

f

=

oo
-00

(8)

If n is large, we might want to approximate the
distribution of X with a simpler one that groups the Xi into

categories and assigns them differing probabilities. We
might even approximate X as continuous; the expectation
notation of (12) is general enough to accommodate this.
Moreover, if X is in fact continuous-that is, if we seek
the best fit to a given continuous distribution-we can

still use (12) by viewing the continuous distribution as
equivalent to an unspecified exchangeable sample of

some specifled size, n. For example, if we elicit a
judgmental cumulative probability distribution for X from
an expert, we might set n equal to the number of
cumulative points elicited. The parameter n reflects our
uncertainty about the input distribution; if there is none, n
is infinite and (12) r equires a perfect fit. Conveniently,
with the cost measure g(m) = a mk as in
only the combined parameter .k/n.

H(X) =-E[ ln fx(X) ],

(9)

so relative entropy can be expressed as a difference:

(10)

D(X,Y) =-E[ In fy(X)] -H(X) .

Let X represent a random draw from the exchangeable

Xn): that is, X equals Xi w i t h
probability 1/n fori= 1,
n. Let Y have the probability

sample

x

= (xt.

···,

···,

distribution that generates each element of the sample,
and let Y have the corresponding joint distribution. Then
in general the likelihood of x, fy(x), can be expressed in

terms of an expectation over X:

fy(x) =

n�=l fy(Xj) ]
= exp[ tf=t I n fy(xi)]

entropy H(X) is independent of m, (12) can be expressed
directly in terms of relative entropy:

(13)

entropy plus the size penalty.

A SEARCH HEURISTIC AND A
COMPARISON USING MIXTURE
MODELS

A simple heuristic to search for the best model from a
sequence of nested models, for any of the three
approaches, is to try successive models, starting with the

smallest, and stop with model m when tbe objective

function for model m + 1 is no greater than for model m.
This heuristic could miss the global optimum if the
objective function has multiple local optima, so we might
check one or more subsequent models to reduce this risk.
(Cheeseman et al. [1988] give a similar heuristic that
decrements the model index.)
Such a check is
unnecessar y in the example below.

"

Therefore the effectiveness ratio maximization (6) can be

If X is continuous, this heuristic can simply test the

wbere Y (m) has the density estimated for model m. This
decrease in relative entropy is nonnegative because the
models are nested, allowing successively better fits. With
the size penalty g(m} =a km, the right-hand side of (15)

becomes the constant (ln k) I n, while with g(m) = a mk,
as in the example below, the right-hand side of (15)

becomes ktn ln[(m + 1)/m], a slowly increasing function
ofm.

Figure 1 illustrates all three approaches. The candidate
models are mixtures of one or more univariate Gaussian
distributions with parameters determined by the EM
algorithm, which part a illustrates. The input data is an
exponential distribution (chosen for its simplicity and
very non-Gaussian n ature), viewed as equivalent to an
exchangeable sample of size n = 100. Since we already
know the continuous distribution, the model selection
problem is to select the Gaussian mixture that best fits this
distribution, accounting for the anticipated cost of
calculations using the result.
The continuous input allows all three methods to be
viewed as minimizing relative entropy plus a size penalty.

This penalty is

MAP approach with a

proportional to mk.

Note that the penalty always decreases (that is, the
accuracy term becomes relatively more important) with

the sample size n, but more slowly for the BIC than for
the other objectives.
Part b indicates the similarity of the approaches for some
parameter settings. However, as part b suggests, for large
sizes the size penalty for effectiveness ratio maximization
becomes weaker than for the other approaches (except the
MAP approach with a flat prior, which requires a perfect
fit), because the penalty is logarithmic rather than linear in
m. The optimal number of components is infinite when
there is no penalty, but is only two to six for the other
objectives illustrated. A uniform, rather than exponential,
input distribution gives similar results with one to six
components optimal [Poland 1994], and we can expect
similarly parsimonious representations with arbitrary
input distributions, allowing simplified calculations.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

As Figure 1 shows, all three approaches can behave
similarly. However, effectiveness ratio maximization has
several advantages. It is the most general approach. It

accepts a continuous distribution as its input, as well as a
sample from one. It is meaningful when none of the
candidate models is believed to be correct or
representative of reality, as when the modeling process is
driven by computational cost considerations. Finally, it
accounts for computational cost explicitly.
These
characteristics are especially valuable in artificial
intelligence applications in which accuracy and
computational cost need to be traded off automatically in
selection from a limited set of candidate probability
models.
Computational experience with full-scale applications
would provide valuable feedback about the relative merits
of the approaches and the most useful extensions. These
might include more general model selection objectives
than the effectiveness ratio and more flexible prior
distributions over the model size than the geometric.

Cases with little data, violating the large-sample
assumption of the statistical criteria, would be of
particular interest.
