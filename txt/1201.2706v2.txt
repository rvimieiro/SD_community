Abstract—This paper presents a new type of evolutionary
algorithm (EA) based on the concept of “meme”, where the
individuals forming the population are represented by semantic
networks and the fitness measure is defined as a function of the
represented knowledge. Our work can be classified as a novel
memetic algorithm (MA), given that (1) it is the units of culture,
or information, that are undergoing variation, transmission,
and selection, very close to the original sense of memetics as
it was introduced by Dawkins; and (2) this is different from
existing MA, where the idea of memetics has been utilized as a
means of local refinement by individual learning after classical
global sampling of EA. The individual pieces of information are
represented as simple semantic networks that are directed graphs
of concepts and binary relations, going through variation by
memetic versions of operators such as crossover and mutation,
which utilize knowledge from commonsense knowledge bases.
In evaluating this introductory work, as an interesting fitness
measure, we focus on using the structure mapping theory of
analogical reasoning from psychology to evolve pieces of information that are analogous to a given base information. Considering
other possible fitness measures, the proposed representation and
algorithm can serve as a computational tool for modeling memetic
theories of knowledge, such as evolutionary epistemology and
cultural selection theory.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The idea that a simple progression of variation, natural
selection, and heredity can account for the great complexity
and apparent design observed in living beings has eventually
led to the formulation of Universal Darwinism, generalizing
the mechanisms and extending the domain of this process
to systems outside biology, including economics, psychology,
physics, and even culture [1], [2]. Within this larger framework, the concept of meme introduced by Dawkins as an
evolving unit of culture—or information, idea, or belief—
analogous to a gene [3], hosted, altered, and reproduced in
individuals’ minds, forms the basis of the field of memetics1 .
Within the discipline of evolutionary computation, the
recently maturing field of memetic algorithms (MA) has
experienced increasing interest as a successful method for
solving many hard optimization problems [4], [5], [6]. The
existing formulation of MA is essentially a hybrid approach,
combining classical evolutionary algorithms (EA) with local
search, where the population-based global sampling of EA in

via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by
leaping from brain to brain...”

each generation is followed by a local search, or learning,
performed by each candidate solution. For this reason, this
approach has been often referred to under different names
besides MA, such as “hybrid EAs” or “Lamarckian EAs”. To
date, MAs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of
problem domains such as NP-hard optimization problems [7],
[8], engineering [9], machine learning [10], [11], and robotics
[12].
The aim of this study is to propose a computational model
comprising a meme pool subject to variation and selection
that will be able to evolve pieces of knowledge under a given
memetic fitness measure, paralleling the existing use of EA in
solving optimization problems. While this approach is based
on memetics, it is unlike the existing sense of the word in current MA (as an hybridization of local search into EA). Rather,
it is intended as a new tool focused exclusively on the memetic
evolution of knowledge itself, which can find use in fields such
as knowledge-based systems, reasoning, and computational
creativity. As the basis of our approach, we introduce a solution representation based on semantic networks [13]. These
are a simple type of formal representation for ontologies,
formed by graphs where vertices correspond to concepts and
edges correspond to directed relations (Fig. 1). To operate on
these structures, we adapt variation operators such as crossover
and mutation to manipulate concepts and relations, utilizing
the commonsense knowledge bases of ConceptNet [14] and
WordNet [15]. From the perspective of representation and
genetic operators, our approach is partly similar to the use of
tree structures in genetic programming [16] and the approaches
of genetic network programming [17], [18], parallel distributed
genetic programming [19], and evolutionary graph generation
[20].
In this paper, we present three main contributions:
•

•

•

Using semantic networks for encoding individual memotypes, where graphs formed by concepts and relations
represent units of evolving knowledge.
Introducing operations for evolutionary variation, such
as mutation and crossover, that are adapted to work on
semantic networks.
Introducing a memetic fitness measure for evolutionary
selection to evaluate our implementation, based on the
structure mapping theory from psychology.

Following an overview of our approach, the paper presents
implementation details of the proposed algorithm in Section II.

II. A N EW T YPE OF M EMETIC A LGORITHM
Our algorithm proceeds similar to conventional EA, with
a relatively small set of parameters. We implement semantic
networks as linked-list data structures of concept and relation
objects. The descriptions of representation, memetic variation,
fitness evaluation, and selection steps are presented in the
following sections. The parameters affecting each step of the
algorithm (Algorithm 1) are given in Table I.

IsA(bird, animal)2 ) describing a subsumption hierarchy that
is true by definition; in assertional networks, the relations
describe instantiations and assertions that are contingently true
(e.g. AtLocation(human, city)) [13]. In this study we combine the two approaches for increased expressivity (Fig. 1).
As such, semantic networks provide a simple yet powerful
means to represent the “memes” of Dawkins as data structures
that are algorithmically manipulatable, allowing a procedural
implementation of memetic evolution.
There are several existing algorithms using graph-based
representations for the encoding of candidate solutions in EA
[21]. The most notable work among these is genetic programming (GP) [16], where candidate solutions are pieces of computer program represented in a tree hierarchy, which is actually
a specific type of graph structure [21]. In parallel distributed
genetic programming (PDGP) [19], the restrictions of the tree
structure of GP is relaxed by allowing multiple outputs from a
node, which allows a high degree of parallelism in the evolved
programs. In evolutionary graph generation (EGG) [20] the
focus is on evolving graphs with applications in electronic
circuit design. Genetic network programming (GNP) [17], [18]
introduces compact networks with conditional branching and
action nodes; and similarly, neural programming (NP) [22]
combines GP with artificial neural networks for the discovery
of network structures via evolution.
The use of a graph-based representation makes the design of
variation operators specific to graphs necessary. In works such
as GNP, this is facilitated by using a string-based encoding of
node names, types, and connectivity, permitting operators very
close to their counterparts in conventional EA; and in PDGP,
the operations are simplified by making nodes occupy points
in a fixed-size two-dimensional grid. What is common with
GP related algorithms is that the output of each node in the
graph can constitute an input to another node. In comparison,
the range of connections that can form a semantic network
of a given set of concepts is limited by commonsense knowledge, i.e. the relations have to make sense to be useful (e.g.
IsA(bird, animal) is meaningful while Causes(bird, table)
is not). To address this issue, we introduce new crossover
and mutation operations for memetic variation, making use
of commonsense reasoning [23], [14] and adapted to work on
semantic networks.
B. Commonsense Knowledge Bases

A. Representation: Semantic Networks as Memes
The algorithm is centered on the use of semantic networks
[13] for encoding evolving memotypes. A semantic network is
a graphic notation for the representation of knowledge in the
form of sets of vertices representing concepts, interconnected
by edges representing relations (Fig. 1). This type of graph
representation has found use in many subfields of artificial
intelligence, including natural language processing, machine
translation, and information retrieval. Constructs resembling
semantic networks have long been in use also in other fields
such as philosophy and linguistics.
An important characteristic of a semantic network is
whether it is definitional or assertional: in definitional
networks the emphasis is on taxonomic relations (e.g.

Commonsense reasoning refers to the type of reasoning
involved in everyday human thinking, based on commonsense
knowledge that an ordinary person is expected to know, or
“the knowledge of how the world works” [23]. Commonsense
knowledge bases such as the ConceptNet3 project of MIT
Media Lab [14] and Cyc4 maintained by Cycorp company
are set up to assemble and classify commonsense information.
The lexical database WordNet5 maintained by the Cognitive
Science Laboratory at Princeton University also has charac2 Here we adopt the notation IsA(bird, animal) to mean that the concepts
bird and animal are connected by the directed relation IsA, i.e. “bird is an
animal.”

teristics of a commonsense knowledge base, via synonym,
hypernym6 , and hyponym7 relations [15].
In our implementation we make use of ConceptNet version
4 and WordNet version 3 to obtain and process commonsense
knowledge, where ConceptNet contributes around 560,000
definitional and assertional relations involving 320,000 concepts and WordNet contributes definitional relations involving
around 117,000 synsets8 , as of the writing of this article.
The hypernym and hyponym relations among noun synsets
in WordNet provide a reliable collection of IsA relations. In
contrast, the variety of assertions in ConceptNet, contributed
by volunteers across the world, makes it more prone to noise.
We address this by ignoring all assertions with a reliability
score (determined by contributors’ voting) below a set minimum Rmin (Table I).
C. Initialization
At the start of a run, the population of size P opsize
is initialized with individuals created by random semantic
network generation (Algorithm 1). This is achieved by starting
from a network comprising only one concept randomly
picked from commonsense knowledge bases and running
a semantic network expansion algorithm that (1) randomly
picks a concept in the given network (e.g. human); (2)
compiles a list of relations—from commonsense knowledge
bases—that the picked concept can be involved in (e.g.
{CapableOf (human, think), Desires(human, eat), · · ·})
(3) appends to the network a relation randomly picked from
this list, together with the other involved concept; and (4)
repeats this until a given number of concepts has been
appended or a set timeout T has been reached (covering
situations where there are not enough relations). Figure 1
presents a random semantic network created this way. Note
that even if grown in a random manner, the network itself is
totally meaningful because it is a combination of information
from commonsense knowledge bases.
The initialization algorithm depends upon the parameters of
Cmax , the maximum number of initial concepts, and Rmin ,
the minimum ConceptNet relation score (Table I).
D. Selection
After the assignment of a fitness value to each individual
in the current generation (Section II-F), all individuals in the
population are replaced with offspring generated by variation
operators applied on parents. The parents are probabilistically
selected from the population according to their fitness, with
reselection allowed. While individuals with a higher fitness
have a better chance of being selected, even individuals with
low fitness have a chance to produce offspring, however
small. In our experiments we employ tournament selection
(Section III).
In each cycle of the algorithm, crossover is applied to parents selected from the population until P opsize × Pc offspring
are created (Table I). Mutation is applied to P opsize × Pm
selected individuals, supplying the remaining part of the next

generation (i.e. Pc + Pm = 1). We also employ elitism, by
replacing a randomly picked offspring in the next generation
with the individual with the current best fitness.
E. Memetic Variation Operators
In contrast with existing graph-structured evolutionary approaches such as GP, PDGP, and GNP that we have discussed
in Section II-A, our representation does not permit arbitrary
connections between different nodes and requires variation
operators that should be based on information provided by
commonsense knowledge bases.
This means that any variation operation on the individuals
should: (1) preserve the structure within boundaries set by
commonsense knowledge; and (2) ensure that even vertices
and edges randomly introduced into a semantic network connect to existing ones through meaningful relations.
Here we present commonsense crossover and mutation
operators specific to semantic networks.
1) Commonsense Crossover: In classical EA, features representing individuals are commonly encoded as linear strings
and the crossover operation simulating genetic recombination
is simply defined as a cutting and merging of this one dimensional object from two parents; and in graph-based approaches
such as GP, subgraphs can be freely exchanged between parent
graphs [24], [16], [21]. Here, as mentioned, the requirement
that a semantic network has to make sense imposes significant
constraints on the nature of recombination.
We introduce two types of commonsense crossover that
are tried in sequence by the variation algorithm. The first
type attempts a sub-graph interchange between two selected
parents similar to common crossover in standard GP; and
where this is not feasible due to the commonsense structure
of relations forming the parents, the second type falls back to
a combination of both parents into a new offspring.
Type I (subgraph crossover): A pair of concepts, one
from each parent, that are interchangeable9 are selected
as crossover concepts, picked randomly out of all possible
such pairs. For instance, in Figure 2, bird and airplane
are interchangeable, since they can replace each other in
the relations CapableOf (·, f ly) and AtLocation(·, air).
In each parent, a subgraph is formed, containing: (1)
the crossover concept; (2) the set of all relations, and
associated concepts, that are not common with the other
crossover concept (In Figure 2 (a), HasA(bird, f eather)
and
AtLocation(bird, f orest);
and
in
(b)
HasA(airplane, propeller),
M adeOf (airplane, metal),
and U sedF or(airplane, travel)); and (3) the set of all
relations and concepts connected to these (In Figure 2 (a)
P artOf (f eather, wing) and P artOf (tree, f orest); and in
(b) M adeOf (propeller, metal)), excluding the ones that are
also one of those common with the other crossover concept
(the concept f ly in Figure 2 (a), because of the relation
CapableOf (·, f ly)). This, in effect, forms a subgraph of
information specific to the crossover concept, which is
insertable into the other parent. Any relations between the
subgraph and the rest of the network not going through the

is a hyponym of X if every Y is a (kind of) X.

crossover concept are severed (e.g. U sedF or(wing, f ly) in
Figure 2 (a)). The two offspring are formed by exchanging
these subgraphs between the parent networks (Figure 2 (c)
and (d)).
Type II (graph merging crossover): A concept from each
parent that is attachable10 to the other parent is selected as
a crossover concept. The two parents are merged into an
offspring by attaching a concept in one parent to another
concept in the other parent, picked randomly out of all possible
attachments (CreatedBy(art, human) in Figure 3. Another
possibility is Desires(human, joy).). The second offspring is
formed randomly the same way. In the case that no attachable
concepts are found, the parents are merged as two separate
clusters within the same semantic network.
2) Commonsense Mutation: We introduce several types of
commonsense mutation operators that modify a parent by
means of information from commonsense knowledge bases.
For each mutation to be performed, the type is picked at
random with uniform probability. If the selected type of
mutation is not feasible due to the commonsense structure of
the parent, another type is again picked. In the case that a set
timeout of T trials has been reached without any operation,
the parent is returned as it is.
Type I (concept attachment): A new concept randomly
picked from the set of concepts attachable to the parent is
attached through a new relation to one of existing concepts
(Figure 4 (a) and (b)).
Type IIa (relation addition): A new relation connecting two
existing concepts in the parent is added, possibly connecting
unconnected clusters within the same network (Figure 4 (c)
and (d)).
Type IIb (relation deletion): A randomly picked relation in
the parent is deleted, possibly leaving unconnected clusters
within the same network (Figure 4 (e) and (f)).
Type IIIa (concept addition): A randomly picked new concept is added to the parent as a new cluster (Figure 4 (g) and
(h)).
Type IIIb (concept deletion): A randomly picked concept is
deleted with all the relations it is involved in, possibly leaving
unconnected clusters within the same network (Figure 4 (i)
and (j)).
Type IV (concept replacement): A concept in the parent,
randomly picked from the set of those with at least one interchangeable concept, is replaced with one of its interchangeable
concepts, again randomly picked. Any relations left unsatisfied
by the new concept are deleted (Figure 4 (k) and (l)).
F. Fitness Measure
Since the evolving individuals in our approach represent
pieces of knowledge, or memes, the fitness measure for evolutionary selection is defined as a function of the represented
knowledge. In Section III we define a memetic fitness measure
based on the structure mapping theory from psychology [25],
to evaluate our approach. The simple fitness function used
in this introductory study can be extended to take graphtheoretical properties of semantic networks into account, such
10 We define a distinct concept as attachable to a semantic network if at
least one commonsense relation connecting the concept to any of the concepts
in the network can be discovered from commonsense knowledge bases.

as the number of nodes or edges, shortest path length, or the
clustering coefficient [26].
Another interesting possibility is to make the inclusion
of certain concepts a requirement, allowing the discovery of
memes formed around a given set of seed concepts. This can
be also achieved through starting the initialization procedure
described in Section II-C with the given concepts.
A direct and very interesting application of our approach
would be to devise experiments with realistically formed
fitness functions modeling selectionist theories of knowledge,
which remain untested until this time. One such theory is
the evolutionary epistemology of Campbell [2], describing
the development of human knowledge and creativity through
selectionist principles such as blind variation and selective
retention (BSVR).
III. E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS
To evaluate our approach, we first introduce a fitness
measure based on structure mapping. The rest of this section
then summarizes our choice of parameters and results from
experiments.
A. Analogy with a Given Semantic Network
As a simple and interesting memetic fitness function, we
introduce analogical similarity with a given semantic network,
utilizing the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) [27], [28].
SME is an algorithm implementing the psychological structure
mapping theory of Gentner [25], often cited as the most
influential work on modeling analogy-making [29]. Using the
analogical matching score from SME as a fitness measure, our
algorithm can evolve collections of information, or memes,
that are analogous to a given one.
SME is based on the idea that an analogy is a one-to-one
mapping from one domain (the base) into another (the target),
which correspond, in our fitness measure, to the semantic network supplied at the start and the individual networks whose
fitnesses are evaluated by the function. The mapping is guided
by the structure of relations between concepts in the two
domains, ignoring the semantics of the concepts themselves;
and is based on the systematicity principle, where connected
knowledge is preferred over independent facts and is assigned
a higher matching score. A commonly used example is the
analogy between the Solar System and the Rutherford–Bohr
model of the atom [25], where sun and planet in the first
domain are analogous to nucleus and electron in the second
domain. The labels and structure of relations in the two
domains (e.g. {Attracts(sun, planet), Orbits(planet, sun),
· · ·} and {Attracts(nucleus, electron), Orbits(electron,
nucleus), · · ·}) define and constrain the possible mappings
between concepts in the two domains that can be formed by
SME.
We make use of our own implementation of SME based
on the original description by Falkenhainer [27] and adapt it
to the simple concept–relation structure of semantic networks,
by mapping the predicate calculus constructs of entities into
concepts, relations to relations, attributes to IsA relations,
and excluding functions.

B. Results
In this introductory study, we adopt values for crossover
and mutation probabilities similar to earlier studies in graphbased EA [24], [16] (Table I). We use a crossover probability
of Pc = 0.85, and a somewhat-above-average mutation rate of
Pm = 0.15, accounting for the high tendency of mutation
postulated in memetic literature11 . We employ tournament
selection, meaning that for each selection, a “tournament” is
held among a few randomly chosen individuals, and the more
fit individual of each successive pair is the winner according
to a winning probability. In our experiments, we subject a

population of P opsize = 200 individuals to tournament selection with tournament size Ssize = 8 and winning probability
Sprob = 0.8.
Using this parameter set, we present the results from two
runs of experiment: evolved analogies for a network describing
some basic astronomical knowledge are shown in Figure 5
and for a network of familial relations in Figure 6. We show
in Figure 7 (a) the progress of the best and average fitness
in the population during the run that produced the results in
Figure 5. The best and average size of semantic networks
forming the individuals are shown in Figure 7 (b). We observe
that evolution asymptotically reaches a fitness plateau after
about 40 generations. This coincides roughly with the point

where the size of the best individual becomes comparable with
that of the given base semantic network (Figure 5), after which
improvements in the one-to-one analogy become sparser.
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is
capable of spontaneously creating collections of knowledge
analogous to the one given in a base semantic network, with
very good performance. In most cases, our implementation
was able to reach extensive analogies within 50 generations
and reasonable computational time.
IV. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
In summary, we have presented a novel evolutionary algorithm that employs semantic networks as evolving individuals,
paralleling the evolutionary model of cultural variation and
selection in the existing field of memetics. This algorithm, to
our knowledge, is the first of its kind. The use of semantic
networks provides a suitable basis to implement the representation and manipulation of memes—in the sense of units of
culture, or knowledge, as it was put forth by Dawkins [3]. We
have introduced preliminary versions of variation operators
that work on this representation, utilizing knowledge from
commonsense knowledge bases. We have also contributed
a memetic fitness measure based on the structure mapping
theory of Gentner [25] with a firm basis in psychology, to

refinement by individual learning after a classical global EA
sampling.
The proposed algorithm is highly relevant from the perspective of computational creativity [31], [32], especially for tasks
such as conceptual blending [33] and story generation [34].
We believe that our approach can fit into both classifications of
creativity discussed by Boden [35]: (1) exploratory creativity,
where the commonsense nature of our memetic operators
addresses the criticism about the lack of world knowledge12 ;
and (2) transformational creativity, where the potential of
evolutionary approaches have already been noted. Within the
field of analogical reasoning, virtually all of existing research
has been focused on the discovery and assessment of pos-

sible analogical mappings between two given domains [29],
while our approach provides a novel technique for the openended discovery of information analogous to a given domain,
together with the analogical mapping.
For future work following this study, we acknowledge
several lines of research concerning the design of the algorithm and its possible applications. Regarding the design,
the research would benefit from exploring different types of
mutation and crossover [24], [17]. It would be significant to
ground the design of such operators on existing theories of
cultural transmission and modification, discussed in sociological theories of knowledge.
Regarding the applications, in an upcoming paper we intend
to focus on different types of computational creativity that
would be achievable with this model. In the long term, we
argue that if a theoretically sound basis for memetic variation and inheritance can be put in place, and together with
realistic memetic fitness measures, our approach can enable
“computational memetic simulations” analogous to those in
computational biology, such as genetic drift or coalescent
theories.

12 Quting

Boden [35]: “What’s missing, as compared with the human mind,
is the rich store of world knowledge (including cultural knowledge) that’s
often involved.”
