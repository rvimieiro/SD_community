Abstract

The potential influence diagram is a
generalization of the standard "conditional"
influence diagram, a directed network
representation for probabilistic inference and
decision analysis [Ndilikilikesha, 1991). It
allows e fficient inference calculations
corresponding exactly to those on undirected
graphs.
In this paper, we explore the
relationship between potential and conditional
influence diagrams and provide insight into the
properties of the potential influence diagram. In
particular, we show how to convert a potential
influence diagram into a conditional influence
diagram, and how to view the potential influence
diagram operation� in terms of the conditional
influence diagram.
Keywords: potential influence diagrams, influence
diagrams, probabilistic inference, decision analysis

INTRODUCTION

The potential influence diagram (PID) is a generalization
of the standard influence diagram, a directed network
representation for probabilistic inference and decision
analysis [Ndilikilikesha, 1991]. Instead of factoring a
joint distribution of the variables into conditional
distributions, the PID only requires that the joint
distribution be factored into nonnegative components.
This small change allows more efficient computation and
updating from evidence observation, but it also
completely changes the semantics, independence, and
fundamental operations of the influence diagram. To
emphasize the contrast between thePID and the standard
influence diagram, we shall refer to the standard diagram as
a conditional influence diagram (CID). In this paper, we
explore the relationships between theCID and thePJD.
A major motivation for using the PID representation is

efficient computation. The algorithms for probabilistic
inference and decision analysis on the CID require
normalizing divisions in order to maintain the conditional
structure [Shachter, 1986; Shachter, 1988; Shachter,
1989). More efficient algorithms maintain an undirected
graphical structure in which such normalization operations
are unnecessary [Jensen et al., 1990a; Jensen et al.,
1990b; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Shachter and
Peot, 1992; Shafer and Shenoy, 1990; Shenoy, 1991;
Shenoy, 1992). Although the computational complexity
of both approaches is of the same order, the latter methods
obtain a constant improvement by avoiding the divisions
and by maintaining fewer tables.
The main advantage of the CID over the undirected
graphical methods has been the success of the directed
graph as a representation for communicating a model. It
has been proven effective for eliciting and presenting
models among quantitative and nonquantitative parties.
ThePID allows the same directed graph to be used for the
more efficient computations. Starting with a CID, a
special case of the PID, various operations might
transform the model to a PID that is not aCID. In this
paper, we develop an algorithm to convert back to the
CID, if it is needed, and we explore the general
relationships between the two types of models. We do
this by first developing the essential primitive operations
on the PID that differ from the CID. This helps explain
the nature of the more complex operations on thePID.
In Section 2 we review the basic properties and operations
ofCID's, and in Section 3 we introduce the corresponding
properties ofPID's. In Section 4, we combine these basic
operations into more complex transformations and
algorithms. Finally, in Section 5 we present some
conclusions and suggestions for future research.

CONDITIONAL INFLUENCE
DIAGRAMS

directed acyclic graph. The nodes in the diagram
correspond to uncertain quantities, some of which can be

observed, decisions which are to be made, and the criterion
for making those decisions. The arcs indicate the
conditioning relationships among those quantities and the
information available at the time the decisions must be

There are several desirable conditions which simplify
management of a CID while not restricting the sensible
models that can be represented. When these conditions are
satisfied, the CID is said to be regular [Shachter, 1986].
These conditions are:

network structure built on a directed acyclic graph [Howard
and Matheson, 1984; Olmsted, 1983; Shachter, 1986].
Each node j in the set N = { 1, ... , n } corresponds to a
variable Xj, and the nodes are partitioned into sets C, D,

1) no directed cycles: this simplifies the factoring
of the distribution and prevents us from learning anything
about a decision we have yet to make. Formally, this
latter condition means that until an optimal policy for
decision X d is determined, X d must be independent of

and V, corresponding to chance nodes (random variables)
drawn as ovals, decision nodes (variables under the
decision maker's control) drawn as rectangles, and the
value node (criterion to be maximized in expectation when
making decisions) drawn as a rounded rectangle. Each
variable Xj has a set of possibilities. Random variable

(and value) X j has a conditional probability distribution
over those possibilities; the conditioning variables have
indices in the set of parents
or conditional
predecessors C(j), and are indicated in the graph by arcs
into node j from the nodes in C(j). Each random variable
Xj is initially unobserved, but at some time its value Xj

might become known. At that point it becomes an
evidence variable, its index is included in the set of
evidence variables E, and this is represented in the diagram
by drawing its oval with shading. The parents of a
decision node Xj have a completely different meaning;
they are informational predecessors I(j), indicating
which variables will be observed before the decision
choice must be made.

As a convention, lower case letters represent specific
possibilities and single nodes while upper case letters
represent variables and sets of nodes. If J is a set of
nodes, then XJ denotes the vector of variables indexed by

J.

For example, the conditioning variables for Xj are

denoted by XcU)·

In addition to the parents, we can define the children of a
node, its ancestors, and its descendants. A list of
nodes is said to be ordered if none of the ancestors of a
node follows it in the list. Such a list exists if and only
if there is no directed cycle among the nodes.
The conditional distributions in the influence diagram
factorize a joint distribution,

this avoids
ambiguities (we also assume the no forgetting condition,
that at any decision we observe all information available
at the time of earlier decisions, including our choice for
the earlier decision);

2) total

3) the presence of a value node if there are
decisions: this provides a criterion; and
4) no children of a value node: this simplifies the
solution procedure.

We will assume for the rest of this paper that we are
dealing with a regular influence diagram.
There are four primitive operations on the CID which are
of interest in this paper: arc reversal, barren node
removal, optimal policy selection, and evidence
instantiation.
(The other primitives involving
deterministic nodes and expected value are computationally
significant but distracting from the issues we are
addressing here.) These four operations are illustrated in
Figure 1.
The conditional distributions, where
significant, are labeled "(C)."

Arc reversal, shown in parts a) and b) of Figure 1, is

the CID representation for Bayes' Theorem. Given a
model in which Xh is conditioned by Xi and other

variables, we transform our model into one in which Xi is
conditioned by X h ; in the process, each inherits the
other's parents in the model,
Pr{ Xh I x1, XK, XL}
+--- Lx · Pr{ Xi I XJ. XK } P r{ Xh I X i , XK , X L}
1

Pr{ Xc=XC• Xy=xy I Xo=x0, XE=x E}
= IIi� D Pr{ Xi==Xi I Xqi)==X C(i) } ,
that is, the joint distribution of the unobserved variables,
conditioned on the decisions and the observations, is
obtained by multiplying the tables for all nondecision
variables. As a result, whenever random variable Xj has

no observed descendants, its posterior distribution can be
obtained completely from its ancestors (and itself); on the
other hand, when it has observed descendants, some of the
information to compute its posterior distribution might be
contained in its descendants.

Pr{ Xi I Xh, x 1, XK, XL}
+---

Pr{ Xhl Xi, XK, XL }

Pr{ Xh I XJ, XK, XL}
Arc reversal can be performed only when the (i, h) arc is
the only path from i to h; otherwise, a directed cycle
would be created. It is the normalization divisions in the
arc reversal operation that we can avoid through the
generalization to a potential influence diagram.

Barren node removal, shown in parts c) and d) of
Figure 1, is the elimination of a nuisance variable, one

that we neither care about nor observe. If an unobserved,
non-value variable Xi has no children, then we can

eliminate it from the model. If it is a random variable
(with a conditional distribution), then it contributes to no
other posterior distributions; if it is a decision variable,
then any choice would be equally desimble.

by Xi can be reduced; these tables are in the node i and its

children. Therefore, after evidence instantiation the arcs
from i to its children can be eliminated. If, on the other
hand, the observation about Xi is imperfect, this can be

modeled by adding a new "dummy" child for i, observing
that child exactly, and using evidence instantiation on that
node.

POTENTIAL INFLUENCE
DIAGRAMS

In this section, we relax the requirements for the
conditional influence diagram slightly, to obtain the
potential influence diagram. We show the two new
primitives needed to exploit this generalization, and
explore some of the properties of this new representation.
A potential influence diagram (PID)is a network structure
similar to the CID, except that the tables for random
variables and the value, now called p otential s,
Pot {XiiXC(i)L are no longer necessarily conditional

probability distributions [Ndilikilikesha, 1991]; all that is
required is that they are nonnegative and that their product
continues to satisfy
Pr{ Xc=x c. Xy=x y I X o=x o. XE =xE }
=IIi� D Pot{ Xj=Xi I Xc(i)=xqi) } ,
that is, the joint distribution of the unobserved variables,
conditioned on the decisions and the observations, is
obtained by multiplying the tables for all nondecision
variables. Since this condition was satisfied in the CID, a
CID is a special cased of a PID. In a potential influence

diagram, some of the information to compute the
posterior distribution for a random variable Xj might be

Optimal policy selection, shown in parts e) and f) of
Figure 1, is the substitution of a policy chance variable in
place of a decision variable, once all of the uncertainties
relevant to but unobserved before the decision have been
removed from the problem, At that point, all of the
parents of the value node are observed at the time of the
decision,
C(V)k; { d} u I(d),
and we can determine the optimal policy by

E vidence instantiation, shown in parts g) and h) of Figure
1, is the incorporation of an observation into the directed
graph. If Xi has been observed to be xi , there is no longer
any need to carry around the information about the other
possibilities for Xi . As a result, all of the tables indexed

contained in its descendants, even when none of those
descendants is observed. We say that a PID is regular if
it satisfies the CID regularity conditions and there is some
corresponding regular CID. We will hereafter assume that
all PID's are regular without any loss of generality, since
we can represent all sensible models using regular
diagrams.

3.1

PRIMITIVE OPERATIONS

There are two primitive operations on the PID which
allow us to exploit its special properties: potential
reversal and conditionalization. These operations are
shown in Figure 2. The potential distributions, where
significant, are labeled "(P)" and empty distributions are
labeled "(1 ) .
Two of the primitive operations for the
"

CID continue to work properly for the PID, optimal

policy selection and evidence instantiation; there is
nothing surprisingly about evidence instantiation, but
there are some subtleties in the optimal policy selection
that make it worth examining later in this section.

As suggested by the conditionalization operation, there is
a strong connection between the PID and observed
evidence nodes in the CID. As an example, the three
diagrams shown in Figure 3 are all "equivalent."
c)

Figure 2. Primitive Operations for the Potential Influence
Diagram

Potential reversal, shown in parts a) and b) of Figure
2, is the PID analog to arc reversal in the CID. Because
all of the dimensions needed to store the product of the
two potentials are available afterwards in node i, there is
no longer a need to store any information in node j
afterwards, and thus no need to send arcs into node j. The
ability to store all of the information in node i is the key
to the potential influence diagram. The new potentials are
Pot{ X i I Xh• X1, XK• X L}
�Pot{ Xi I x1 , XK } Pot{ Xh I Xi, XK, XL }

Theorem 1.

Pot{ xh } � 1 .
Potential reversal, like arc reversal, requires that the (i, h)
arc is the only path from i to h; otherwise, a directed cycle
would be created. The difference between potential
reversal and arc reversal is that the product of the two
potentials created is maintained (in node i) without
normalizing divisions. Only one of the resulting tables is
needed, so there are less numbers to maintain and arcs are
only added to one of the nodes. The other has a scalar "1"
and no incoming arcs at all!

Conditionalization, shown in parts c) and d) of Figure
2, is the means by which a potential distribution is
transformed into a conditional distribution. Since barren
node removal can be performed only on nodes with
conditional distributions, this operation is required
(implicitly) in order to eliminate unobserved variables
from a model.
The conditionalization operation
normalizes a distribution to make it a valid conditional
distribution, and creates a dummy observation node Xm

The three diagrams shown in Figure 3 correspond to the
same joint probability distributions and show the same
conditional independence.
Proof:
We can get from part a) to part b) in Figure 3 by applying
the potential reversal operation. (Note that because m is
observed, it does not need to send an arc back to i.) We
can get from b) to c) by applying the conditionalization
operation. Finally, we can recognize that c) is just a
special case of a), since we can always add an arc from i to
m, and think of the conditional distribution at i as a
#
potential distribution.

3. 2

INDEPENDENCE AND
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS.

As we have seen, the conditionalization operation is
important as a graphical operation, as well as a numerical
one. Another application of this operation is to verify the
independence and information requirements properties of
any inference or decision problem after adding an
observation for each potential distribution [Geiger et al.,
1989; Geiger et al., 1990; Shachter, 1988; Shachter,
1990]. These procedures can be made even more efficient;
we get equivalent results if we simply add a single dummy
observed node child to each node with a potential
distribution, before checking for independence and
information requirements.

3. 3

OPTIMAL POLICY SELECTION

Finally, it is necessary to verify the optimal policy
selection operation for the PID.
Theorem 2.
The optimal policy selection operation as presented for the
CID works correctly for a regular PID.
Proof:
We give a graphical proof as shown in Figure 4. In part
a) we satisfy the normal CID conditions that all
conditioning variables for the value are observed at the
time of the decision. We now use conditionalization to
make the value node conditional. Normally, this requires
adding an arc from D to m, creating a cycle, since m must
be observed before the D decision. Recall, however, that
in any regular CID corresponding to the regular PID (and
in any sensible model), the optimal choice (before it is
made) must be independent of all observations, so no arc
is needed from D to m. We can now select the optimal
policy, to obtain the diagram in part c), and then apply
Theorem 1 to obtain the diagram in part d). Since the
constant nonnegative potential stored in node m does not
change the ordering of optimal policies, we could
equivalently make the optimal choice directly on the value
#
potential.

COMPOUND OPERATIONS AND
ALGORITHMS

The first step in this process is the operation of evidence
p ropagation, whereby a sequence of arc reversal
operations is used to move all of the observed evidence
nodes to the start of an ordered list of all nodes in the
diagram [Chyu, 1990a; Chyu, 1990b; Shachter, 1989;
Shachter et al., 1990]. This yields a diagram that
represents the posterior joint distribution given the
evidence. The algorithm visits each unobserved node in
reverse order, according to some target order, and applies
the following steps:
1. If there are multiple observed children for this node,
combine them into a single observation child whose
parents are the union of the parents of the original
children; and
2. If there is an evidence child for this node, perform arc
reversal from this node to the child. There is no need to
create an arc back from the evidence afterwards.
Afterwards, the ancestors of each evidence node become
decomposable, that is, if any two nodes share a common
child then there is a directed arc between them; also, there
is a unique ordered list of the ancestors of each evidence
node after evidence propagation.
An example of evidence propagation is shown in Figure
5. The original graph, with five variables, is shown in
part a). In part b) we have been given imperfect evidence
about two of the variables, B and E, and now we can
apply the algorithm with target order ( A B C D E ).
Visiting E, reverse arc (E, G) to obtain the graph shown
in part c). Now reverse the arc (D, G), and combine F and
G into a single observation node with parents B and C, to
obtain the graph shown in part d). If we continue,
reversing the arcs (C, FG), (B, FG), and (A, FG), we end
up with the graph shown in part e). Note that there is
now a unique ordered list for the whole graph (all of the
unobserved nodes were ancestors of G), and it is
decomposable.
Alternatively, we could have started with target order ( C
A B D E ). In this case, we should first reverse arc (A, C)
so that the target order is ordered for the original graph as
shown in part f). Now propagating the evidence F and G,
we obtain the diagram shown in part g). Again, it is
decomposable for the ancestors of G, but now those
ancestors do not include A and so we obtain a simpler
final graph. By choosing the "right" target order, we can
obtain any desired decomposable graph [Chyu, 1990a;
Chyu, 1990b; Shachter et al., 1990].
4.2

Having built the primitive operations for the PID, we can
combine them to construct the compound operations and
algorithms to solve inference and decision problems and to
transform PID's into CID's.

PID TO CID CONVERSION.

This same technique can be employed to convert a PID to
a CID. Suppose that A, B, and C have conditional
distributions, but D and E have potential distributions.
We can conditionalize D and E to obtain the graph shown
in part c), and apply evidence propagation to end up with
either of the graphs shown in parts e) and g). A more
efficient version would wait to conditionalize a node until

The general operation of probabilistic reduction is
the removal from the diagram of an unobserved random
variable. In the CID, this is performed by reversing all of
the outgoing arcs from a node (in the graph order of the
children) until the node is barren and it can be removed. If
it has a value child, that can always be last in the graph
order, so it will be the last to be removed. Some added
efficiency can be obtained in the last reversal and removal
by recognizing that a new distribution does not need to be
computed in the node that will be removed.
The probabilistic reduction is more complex in the PID,
but there is greater opportunity for efficient computation
[Ndilikilikesha, 1991]. The full story is shown in Figure
6 and with the four cases below for the unobserved node i
that we want to reduce.
we take the diagram as
shown in part a), conditionalize to obtain the diagram
shown in part b), then apply the barren node removal to
obtain the diagram in part c). The conditional distribution
doesn't need to be built--we just need to keep track of the
I.

no parents or children:

Figure 6. Probabilistic Reduction in a Potential Influence
Diagram

2. no children but at least one parent: unlike the
CID, the PID requires us to extract any information from
node i about its parents before we can remove it.
Distinguish one of the parents of i, j, such that there is no
path from j to the rest of i's parents, K. (There might be
a path from K to j.) Starting with the diagram shown in
part d), we conditionalize to obtain the diagram in part e),
so we can now perform barren node removal on i.
Finally, we reverse the U. m) arc as in Theorem 1, to
obtain the diagram shown in part f). The calculation is

� L x Pot{ X i

I Xj> XK } Pot{ Xj I XK } .

3. one child: starting with the diagram in part g), use
potential reversal to obtain the diagram in part h), and

then apply the no children case above to obtain the

4. multiple children: this is the most general case.
First, pick one of i's children, j, which can appear after all
of the others; if i is a parent of the value node, then the
value node should be selected. Starting with the diagram
as shown in part j), reverse the arc from i to each child
(except j) to obtain the diagram in part k). Finally, apply
the single child case above to obtain the diagram in part
1). The calculations can be summarized as

PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE.

All the pieces are now in place to perform probabilistic
inference in the PID as in the CID [Shachter, 1988], but
with greater efficiency. Any observations of evidence
should be instantiated and nuisance variables reduced; the
resulting PID is the posterior diagram. If desired, it can
be converted into a CID for communication to experts and
decision makers. A message passing algorithm could also
be developed for propagation of posterior marginals
similar to [Jensen et al., 1990a; Jensen et al., 1990b;
Shafer and Shenoy, 1990].

DECISION ANALYSIS.

In a similar fashion, all the pieces have been assembled to
perform decision analysis as in the CID, and the same
completeness proof applies [Shachter, 1986]. At each
step in the algorithm, until there are only observed nodes
and the value node remaining, either:

1. reduce some barren node;

a Potential Influence Diagram

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
RESEARCH

2. reduce some probabilistic node which is unobserved; or

3. there is some decision node whose optimal policy can
be selected and do so.
For example, consider the classic oil wildcatter problem
shown in part a) of Figure 7 [Raiffa, 1968]. All of the
nodes, Experimental Test, Seismic Test, Amount of Oil,
Revenues, and Cost are unobserved and can be reduced in
any order, to yield the diagram shown in part b). After
optimal policy selection we obtain the diagram in part c).
Now Test Results and Drill? are unobserved and can be
reduced in any order to yield the diagram in part d).
Finally, we can select the optimal policy for Test? and
then reduce it to obtain the final diagram in part e).

We have shown that all of the properties of the potential
influence diagram (PID) can be derived from two simple
primitive operations, which we introduce in this paper.
These operations help explain the different semantics of
the PID as it relates to the conditional influence diagram
(CID). The real power of the PID lies in the ease with
which we can incorporate its efficiencies starting with an
assessed CID, and still recover a CID for explanation and
insight at any time.
Several research extensions involve incorporating some of
the efficient techniques used to solve CID's into PID's,
and they seem promising. First, it would be nice to

390

efficiently represent deterministic relationships in the PID
without having to first compile the model [Andersen et
al., 1989]. Second, because of its generality, the PID
loses conditional independence information relative to the
CID. One approach would be to maintain the CID
independence information within the PID; another would

straightforward to extend the CID dynamic programming
algorithm [Tatman, 1985; Tatman and Shachter, 1990] to
perform dynamic programming within the PID. This
would combine the efficiency of the undirected
computations [Shachter and Peot, 1992; Shenoy, 1991;
Shenoy, 1992] with the flexibility and power of the
directed graph. In these and in several other areas
involving the tradeoffs between model transparency and
computational efficiency, our real insights will come from
practical experience in implementation and application.
