Abstract
An approach to reasoning with default rules where
the proportion of exceptions, or more generally the
probability of encountering an exception, can be at
least roughly assessed is presented. It is based on
local uncertainty propagation rules which provide
the best bracketing of a conditional probability of
interest from the knowledge of the bracketing of
some other conditional probabilities. A procedure
that uses two such propagation rules repeatedly is
proposed in order to estimate any simple
conditional probability of interest from the
available knowledge. The iterative procedure, that
does not require independence assumptions, looks
promising with respect to the linear programming
method. Improved bounds for conditional
probabilities are given when independence
assumptions hold.
1 INTRODUCTION

In commonsense reasoning it is very usual to manipulate
rules with exceptions. One of the most important cases of
such rules consists in default statements containing
explicit or implicit numerical quantifiers. Even when they
are explicit these quantifiers may be only vaguely stated as
for instance in the proposition "most students are young" ;
see (Zadeh, 1985). The numerical approach interprets the
linguistic term "most" in this example as an ill-defined
numerical quantifier expressing the proportion of young
people among students, in a certain context (for simplicity
we assume here that 'young' has a clear-cut meaning and
is not viewed as a fuzzy predicate ; see (Dubois and Prade,
1988) for preliminary results on the handling of fuzzy
predicates in this framework). More generally, we may
have some imprecise statement about the value of the
probability of not encountering an exception, i.e. in our
example, the conditional probability P(young I student) is
bounded from below by some number in [0,1]. This type
of incomplete statistical information is considered by
Kyburg (1974) as a large part of our commonsense
knowledge. P(young I student) is often also regarded as a
degree of certainty that a student taken at random is indeed
young.

Different kinds of treatment can be imagined for rules of
the kind "if A then B with probability P(B I A)." This can
be illustrated considering the above rule and another which
can be chained with it, namely, "if B then C with
probability P(C I B)." Applying Bayes rule we have
P(C I A) <': P(B n C I A)= P(C I A n B}P(B I A) (here
we use the same symbol 'n' for denoting the conjunction
of propositions or the intersection of the classes of items
which satisfy the propositions). Then assuming
irrelevance of A with respect to C in the context B,
namely assuming here that P(C I A n B)= P(C I B), we
obtain the lower bound P(C I B)-P(B I A) for P(C I A). But
without this kind of assumption, as soon as P(C I B) * 1,
nothing can be said about the value of P(C I A) which can
take any value in the interval [0,1]. Indeed nothing forbids
to have A n C = 0 (leading to P(C I A)= 0) as well as
A>;;; C (leading to P(C I A)= I) for instance. Interestingly
enough if we add some information about P(A I B) we
may obtain non-trivial bounds for P(C I A) just from
bounds on P(B I A), P(A I B) and P(C I B). Then more
generally we may choose either i) to exploit the available
knowledge on conditional probabilities for computing the
best possible upper and lower bounds for some other
conditional probabilities of interest, or ii) to take
advantage of independence assumptions (which are perhaps
hard to check) and prior probabilities for computing
probability estimates (Pearl, 1988). The first approach
may give no informative result, but when results are
informative, they are very strong. On the contrary, the
Bayesian approach always gives informative results, but
these results can always be questioned by the arrival of
new pieces of information. In this paper we investigate the
first approach in detail.
Formally, let X be a set of objects, A and B be two

subsets of X, and Qit be a subset of values (which may
reduce to a single value) expressing what is known about

the proportion of A's which are B's. Qit is a subinterval of
the unit interval [0,1], corresponding to the default rule

"Qit A's are B's." This knowledge is understood as a
constraint acting on the cardinality of B relative to A, i.e.:
lA (1 Bl
E Qt!;;;; [0,1]
IAI
where IAI is the cardinality of the subset A. More
generally, it is equivalent to a piece of information of the

[P.(B I A), P (B I A)] where only the
*
two bounds P.(B I A) and P (B I A) are known. Indeed

form P(B I A)

E

relative cardinality is a particular case of conditional
probability, where the underlying distribution is uniformly
distributed over X. Thus proportions and probabilities
obey the same mathematical laws and we shall use them
in an interchangeable way in the following.
We use a network representation, as for instance the one
on Figure 1, where the two directed edges between two

nodes A and B are weighted by Q� and � . i.e. what is
known of the proportions of B's which are A's and of A's
which are B's. Note that in terms of conditional
probabilities we assume information on both P(A I B) and
P(B I A), which contrasts with Bayesian networks (Pearl,
1988). Besides P(A) will be interpreted as P(A I X) where
X stands for the set of all considered objects or in logical
terms corresponds to the ever-true proposition. Hence all
probabilities that we handle are (bounds of) conditional
probabilities in a network where cycles are allowed, and no
prior probability information is required in order to start
the inference process in the approach described in this
paper (contrary to Quinlan ( 1983)'s INFERNO system or
Baldwin (1990)'s support logic programming).
Other works have been published, that handle probability
bounds (see (Dubois et al., 1990) for a survey). However,
these works always assume knowledge about
unconditional probabilities (i.e. P(A) = P(A I X) in our
framework) and are often oriented towards the computation
of unconditional probabilities P(B). This is not true here.
The reasoning systems of Bacchus (1990) aim at
embedding the type of knowledge we deal with into a
formal logical setting. Contrastedly our aim is to specify
efficient inference algorithms.

which can help improve the known bounds on an inference
network in a single propagation step. Section 5 recalls the
previously studied inference patterns involving
conjunctions and disjunctions of two terms and discusses
the handling of negation. Section 6 presents the general
strategy that exploits two propagation rules in order to
answer queries about conditional probabilities of interest.
Section 7 illustrates the approach on an example. Section
8 discusses the handling of conjunction and disjunction in
queries. Section 9 considers the introduction of
independence assumptions in the chaining of conditional
probabilities. In the conclusion, analogies with non­
monotonic reasoning are pointed out.
2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

We suppose that we know some default rules containing
numerical quantifiers or conditional probabilities such as

•'Ql}

A's are B' s" or "if A then B with probability
P(B I A)."

The objective of our research is to answer queries like :
"what proportion of A's are C's ?," "what proportion of
A's and B's are C's ?," "what proportion of C's are A's
and B's ?," "what proportion of A's or B's are C's ?," or
"what proportion of C's are A's or B's ? ;" or similar
queries stated in terms of conditional probabilities, from
the available knowledge about the values of other
proportions or conditional probabilities. This corresponds
respectively to evaluate the probabilities p = P(C I A),
P(C I A n B), P(A n B I C), P(C I A u B) or
P(A u B I C). The possible values of p usually form an
*
interval [p.,p ], and not just a single value, where P• is
*
the lowest value and p the highest value possibly taken
by the conditional probability. Usually, a good local
uncertainty propagation method will provide bounds that
*
bracket [p.,p ], i.e. the deduction method will be sound. If
it supplies exact bounds, it is called complete. The
inference patterns we shall use in the following sections
are sound and are also complete when we consider just the
elementary network corresponding to the statement of the
pattern, i.e. they are said to be locally complete.

In the following sections, we are going to present
computational methods that can handle imprecisely-known
conditional probabilities. This work pursues an earlier
investigation. In Dubois and Prade (1988), see also
LeaSombe (1990), a first local pattern of reasoning,
corresponding to the transitive chaining syllogism was
studied. In (Dubois et al., 1990) two other local patterns
enable us to estimate conditional probabilities involving
conjunctions of events or contexts in their expression. A
more complete set of propagation rules is presented in
(Amarger et a!. 1991).

Our view of a knowledge base in this paper is thus a
collection of general statements regarding a population X
of objects ; these statements express in imprecise terms
the proportions of objects in various subclasses of X, that
belong to other subclasses. This knowledge base allows
for answering queries about a given object, given a
subclass to which it belongs (also called its "reference
class" by Kyburg). To do so we just apply to this object
the properties of this subclass, implicitly assuming that it
is a typical element of this class. If more information
become available for this object, we just change its
reference class accordingly.

After presenting the problem is section 2, section 3 recalls
how our problem can be reduced to linear programming.
Section 4 presents a generalized version of Bayes' theorem

Computing bounds for P(B I A) is a matter of constraint
propagation, and is not based on updating a probability

distribution, contrary to Bayesian reasoning. Namely,
given that we know that an object of interest is in
subclass A, we certainly do not interpret this fact as
P(A) 1. Indeed adding the constraint P(A) = 1 to the
knowledge base may lead to modify the set of probability
measures that obey the constraints induced by probability
bounds (e.g. P(C I A n B) must become equal to
P(C I B)). This is because P(A) = 1 means that X A is
an empty set ; on the contrary, a "fact" "x E A" in our
system just indicates that we look for the properties of
members of subset A. Although in Bayesian reasoning,
computing P(B I A) is the same as assuming the posterior
probability of A is 1 because the probability distribution
on X is unique, these two operations no longer coincide
with probability bounds : one is just focusing on a
reference class (what can be said about B, for memhers of
A?) while the other is knowledge updating (see Dubois and
Prade, 1991b). Dubois and Prade (1991b) further discuss
the difference between focusing and updating in the
framework of belief functions. As for the difference
between computing P(B I A) and P(B) when A is an
accepted fact, this topic has been considered in the
philosophical literature for a long time. See e.g. Suppes
(1966).

3 A LINEAR PROGRAMMING METHOD

It has been shown in (Paass, 1988) that reasoning from
numerically quantified general rules may be modelled as an
optimization problem. Namely, if there are n atomic
symbols in the network, there are 2" possible worlds, and
we can express all constraints on conditional probabilities
as linear constraints where the variables x; correspond to
the unknown probabilities of possible worlds i. The
calculation of bounds on an unknown conditional
probability P(A I B) comes down to find the maximum
and the minimum of a rational fraction whose numerator
sums the probabilities of the possible worlds where A
and B are true, and whose denominator sums the
probabilities x; of the possible worlds where B is true,
under the constraints induced by the already known
probability bounds and to the requirement that the x;'s
sum to one.
X;

The same approach may be used to solve any query. As we
can see we are faced with a fractional linear programming
problem of the form (P),
(P) Opti c·tx_ x 2: 0 under Px I, M·x �
d-tx
where li is the "unit vector," c, d, x are row vectors, M is
a matrix, "Opti" is either "Max" or "Min," and t denotes
the transposition, can be transformed into an equivalent
linear program (P'). Indeed, as pointed out by (Charnes and
Cooper, 1962), letting y; = xV(d·tx), we obtain :
(P') {Opti c-ty, y 2:0 under M·y � 0, d-ty = 1)

{

o)

So, as explained and exemplified in (Amarger et al.,
1990), the calculation of bounds for P(B I A) requires that
two linear programs be solved (one to compute the exact
lower bound and one to compute the exact upper bound).
But, even if with this method we are able to precisely
compute the best bounds bracketing the conditional
probability of interest, it is hard to try to provide an
explanation for the obtained results in terms of the
available knowledge we start with.
This reduction of a fractional linear programming problem
induced by probability constraints to a linear programming
problem has been also pointed out and used in (van der
Gaag, 1990), where also local computation methods are
proposed on the basis of the decomposition of the linear
system into subsystems, and exploiting independence
relationships when they are known. Methods based on
local inference patterns may provide less precise results
(although they are guaranteed to be sound), but are faster
and their results easier to explain.
4 GENERALIZED

BAYES' THEOREM

In the framework of numerical quantifiers, because we
manipulate conditional probabilities, it would be
interesting to use the Bayes' theorem :
VA, B, P{AIB)=P(BIA)· P(A)IP(B)
But,' in our approach we do not assume that P(A) and P(B)
ai'e known. A more general identity, where only
conditional probabilities appear can be established :
Proposition 1 : Generalized Bayes' theorem
p (A;\ A; !)
v A !,· , Ak, p(A! lAte)=p(AkIA!)IT
+
; = 1 P(A;+! I A;)
when all involved quantities are positive.
. .

This identity is easily proved replacing conditional
probabilities P(A I B) by their expressions
P(A n B)/P(B). Note that this identity tells us that given
a cycle At. Az, ... , Ak, Ak+t =At in a probabilistic
network, the 2.k quantities (P(Aj I Ai+t). i E ]k]} u
(P(Ai+t I Aj), i ]k]) (where )k) ]0, k) n il'i) are not
independent when positive: any 2.k - 1 of these quantities
determine the remaining one. Now, because we use upper
and lower probabilities, we extend this theorem as
follows:
Proposition 2 : Generalized Bayes' theorem upper/lower probabilities case.
Given k sets At, A2, ... , A k , with k 2, the
following inequalities should hold :

Constraint Propagation with Imprecise Conditional Probabilities

A simpler version of Proposition 2 is used by Fertig and
Breese (1990) for arc reversal in influence diagrams where
probabilities are incompletely known. Proposition 2 is the
basis of a first inference rule for tightening probability
bounds in a set of ill-known conditional probabilities.

Namely given a knowledge base 3:e = {(P* (A i I A ) ,
p *(Ai I Aj)), i, j E ]n]} ; we can associate to it a network
G with n nodes A1, A2, ... , An and whose arcs (Ai,Aj) are
weighted by d.i i+1 . Proposition 2 leads to update
P*(A I B), and p*(A I B) in one step as follows
P•(A I B)= P•(B I A)·

The second update is easily explained noticing that

bounds do not correspond to a revision of the knowledge,
but only to constraint propagation steps ; namely the set
of probability measures such that V i, j, P*(Ai I A_j) s;
P(Ai I Aj) s; P* (A i I A) never changes.
As it can be guessed, the propagation of the constraint
expressed by Proposition 1 is achieved by computing the
longest (i.e. most weighted) elementary paths from A to B
and from B to A in the network G where arcs (A,B) and
(B,A) have been suppressed. Here the length of the path is
the product of all weights of arcs in the path. For reason
of computing accuracy, it is better to compute the length
of the paths using a standard (max, +) path algebra,
changing di,i+ l into Log d,i i+l· Then any shortest path
algorithm will do. Note that the length of a circuit A1, . . . ,
Ak, Ak+ l = A1 in G is such that d1,2 · .d.2,3 ... .d.k.l,k ·

and is a consequence of Proposition 1. Hence in the
network with weights of the form Log d.,i j • no circuit will
be of positive length. Hence longest paths between nodes
will always exist.
The constraint propagation steps (1) and (2) can be used as
an inference rule that we shall denote BG (Bayes
generalized) in the following.
5 LOCAL INFERENCE RULES

The first local inference pattern, already examined in
(Dubois and Prade, 1988) and in (Dubois et al., 1990),

corresponds to the evaluation of a missing arc in the
inference network, and can be viewed as the counterpart of
node removal in influence diagrams.
The problem solved by this pattern, also called
(QS) is the following:
given bounds on P(A I B), P(B I A), P(C I B) and
P(B I C), what are the bounds on P(C I A) (thus
removing node B). The following bounds can be shown to
be the tightest ones :
lower bound :
1 - 1 - P•(C I B) (3)
P-(C I A)= Po(B I A) max
P-(AIB)
ugper bound :
P .(B)A). p'(C)B)
,
p'(C)A)= min l.l- P.(B)A) +
P·(A)B)
P'(B IA)P'(c IB) r'(B IA)P'(c IB) [l -P·(B
I c) ]+P'(B I A) (4)
P·(A)B )P·(B )c)' P·(AIB)P.(B)C)
"quantified syllogism rule"

)

(o.

(

)

The application of QS to the network with nodes A, B, C
for the calculation of P(C I A) is denoted QS(C, B, A) =
(C, A). For a proof that these bounds are optimal see
(Dubois and Prade, 1988 ; Dubois et a!., 1990).

3

This pattern can be ex tended to more than nodes in
sequence. It can be proved that optimality is preserved.
Especially, given (A, B, C, D), it is equivalent to remove
B first (computing P(C I A)), then C, or C first
(computing P(D I B)), and then B, in order to get
P(D I A), i.e. there is an associativity property.
Proposition

3 : QS(QS(D,C,B),A) = QS(D,QS(C,B, A))

Proof : First, consider the network
applying QS we get bounds for

P(C

I

A)

{A, B, C) ;
and P(A I C).

Then we could think of applying QS again in order to
improve bounds of

I

P(C

B)

for instance. Clearly this

process will not lead to improve these bounds. Indeed
if these bounds were inlproved using P(B I A), P(A I B),
and the calculated bounds on

P(C I A), P(A

I

C),

it

would indicate that quantities P(B I C) or P(C I B) are
related to P(B I A) or P(A I B). But this is clearly not
true. Similarly the knowledge about P(D I

P(C

I D) has no influence on

P(B

I

C)

and

C) and
P(C I B),

hence has no influence on the optimal bounds of

P(C I A)

and

P(A I C).

The optimality of the QS rule

then implies that the result of applying it on P(C I A) ,
P(A I C), P(C I D), P(D I C) will also give optimal
bounds on P(D I

A)

and

P(A

I D). The same reasoning

applies if we compute P(D I B), P(B I D) first. In both
cases we get optimal bounds on P(D I A) and

P(A

I D). Associativity then follows from optimality.

Q.E.D.

This result could also be derived by the study of the linear
program associated to the network, looking for
decomposability properties of the constraint matrix.
Clearly, this property of QS is very nice and easily
generalizes to a network with any number of nodes. Thus
on a "linear chain" beginning with node A1 and ending

29

30

Amarger, Dubois, and ftade

with node Ak, we can apply QS iteratively, from left to
right, in order to evaluate P(Ak I A 1) for instance,
without resorting to linear programming.
In (Dubois et a!., 1990) the expression of bounds on
P(A n B I C) and P(C I A n B) in terms of more
elementary conditional probabilities P(A I C), P(C I A),
P(C I B), P(B I C), P(A I B) and P(B I A) have been
established starting with a complete network with nodes
A, B, C. The case of disjunction is solved in (Amarger et
a!., 1991) where probabilities of the form P(A u B I C)
and P(C I A u B) are explicitly obtained under the same
setting. Disjunction and conjunction are addressed in
Section 8 using the two rules QS and BG.
The case of negation is especially interesting. Indeed,
given P(B I A) and P(A I B), we obviously know
P(-,B I A) and P(-,A I B) where -, denotes
complementation. However it is easy to verify that
P(A I -,B) and P(B I -,A) remain totally unknown. It is
indeed easy to check that
P(A 1-,B) = P(A I B){( 1/p(B I A))- 1} P(B)/p(-,B) (5)
In other words, answering queries of the form "How many
not B's are A's" require the knowledge of unconditional
probabilities. A possible other way of dealing with
negation is to introduce the closed world assumption
which can be stated as follows : if sets A, B and C;, i E
]n] appear in the network, then let us assume that the
universe is reduced to Au B u UieJnJ C;. In other words,
we assume that the set -,A

n

-,B

n n1e Jnl

-,C; is

empty, or at least that P(-,A n -,B n nieJnJ -,C;) = 0.
In the trivial case where we consider the classes A
and B only, it leads to P(-,A n -,B) = 0, and then
P(A I -,B) = P(A I A n -,B) = 1. So, if we "open" the
world by considering C also, then we assume P(-,A n -,B
n -,C)= 0. Since -,B = [-,B n (Au C)] u [-,B n -,(Au
C)]= -,B n (Au C)u (-,An -,B n -,C), then P(-,B) =
P(-,B n (Au C)). Thus we change the question "what is
the value of P(A I -,B) ?" into "what is the value of
P(A 1-,B n (Au C)) ?". A systematic way of dealing
with these questions require a proper handling of Boolean
expressions in conditional probabilities.
6 A CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION

B ASED ON INFERENCE RULES

In the previous sections, we have presented two local
inference rules, and now, the problem is to use these rules
in order to perform automated reasoning with the whole
network. The aim of this section is to build a reasoning
strategy in order to be able to answer any simple query
(i.e. a query of the form "what is the proportion of A's
which are C's? ," where A and C are atoms in the
language). The network is supposed to be made out of
simple conditional probabilities of the form P(A I B)
where A and B are atomic symbols.

Graphically, to answer a query like "what proportion of
X's are Y's ?" is equivalent to generate the new arc
<X, Y> in a network like the one of Figure 1. Our
approach is local in the sense that the patterns are designed
to provide answers to particular queries using local
inference rules. Consequently, one can observe the
influence of each piece of knowledge on the result; global
methods do not offer such a possibility. Even though a
part icular pattern corresponds to an elementary network,
_
the mference
patterns can work on any network, whatever
its structure, unlike the Bayesian approach which needs an
acyclic network topology (e.g. directed cycles are
prohibited) adapted to the propagation mechanism ; see
(Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988 and Pearl, 1988).
Of course, in practice, in order to answer a particular
query, it may exist several possibilities for applying the
inference patterns to the network, corresponding to
different paths. Since the inference rules are sound, one can
easily combine the different results provided by all the
applications of rules because their intersection still
provides a sound result. Indeed, let us suppose that Q1 =
[P•l·P*!l and Q2 = [P•2·P*2 ] are two intervals that
contains the value p we want to estimate; then we have :
p E Q1 n Q2 = [max(P•1 ,p.2 ), min( p*l ,p*2)]. This

generalizes to the intersection of any number of intervals;
and the emptiness of the intersection would be the proof
that the data we start with are not consistent.

We will first use a saturation strategy in order to extract as
much information as we can from the network, namely,
try to get probability intervals as tight as possible for all
conditional probabilities P (A I B). The result is called
the saturated network.
We are going to use two tools : rule QS (corresponding to
the basic quantified syllogism) presented in Section 5., in
order to add links to the network, and the generalized
Bayes' theorem (rule BG) presented in Section 4.
Step 1 : recursively apply QS, to generate the missing
arcs. This step is performed until the probability
intervals can no more be improved.
Step 2 : recursively apply BG to improve the arcs
generated by Step 1.
Then, the general algorithm is :
(a)
perform Step 1
(b) perform Step 2
(c)
if the probability intervals have been improved go
to (a), otherwise stop
Note that the two steps are very complementary. Indeed,
step 1 uses an optimal rule but a local one, while step 2
uses a suboptimal method but considers more than
3-tuples of nodes.
Another important problem encountered in inference
system is the consistency of the knowledge base. Using

Constraint Propagation with Imprecise Conditional Probabilities

the global method presented in Section 3., if one of the
two linear programs we have to solve (or both) has no
solution, we can say that there is an inconsistency in the
constraints of the linear programs, i.e. an inconsistency in
the knowledge base. Solving only one linear program is
enough to find out an inconsistency (if any) among the
constraints expressing the knowledge base. If there is
some inconsistency, exhibiting the Simplex array, we will
be able to determine where is the inconsistency, i.e. which
arcs are inconsistent. So, our system is of the following
general form :
(a)
consistency checking by linear programming
if an inconsistency is detected, exit
(b) saturation of the network
(c)
answering user's queries.
The considered queries are of the form P(A I B) ? .
Using results in established in (Dubois et al., 1990;
Amarger et a!., 1991) we can also handle queries of
the form P(A u B I C) ? , P(A n B I C) ?,
P(C I An B) ?, ... Of course, steps (a) and (b) may take a
long time computation, but they only are performed once
for all at the beginning of the session, in order to ensure
that the user works with a consistent knowledge base, and
to make all the information explicit.
7 AN EXAMPLE

In this section, our purpose is to point out the results
given by both the quantified syllogism and generalized
Bayes' theorem. The algorithm we use is written in "C"
on a Sun 3/50 workstation without arithmetical co­
processor and the Floyd algorithm is used to compute the
longest paths (see (Gondran and Minoux, 1985) for
instance). The example we use is already considered in
(Dubois et a!., 1990), and is pictured in Figure 2 and, in
the following, we use the incidence matrix notation to let
the saturated network be more readable.

The computation of the complete "saturated" matrix was
made in 10 seconds (CPU and I/0 time).
The optimal solution computed by the global method
presented in Section 3., and in (Amarger et a!., 1990) is
exactly the same as the one computed by the "local
method" based on QS and BG. Let us note that the "global
method" is written in "C", on a Sun 3/50 workstation,
without arithmetical co-processor; and the computation of
each element of the "optimal" matrix is made in 12
seconds (CPU and 1(0 time). So, combining a locally
optimal method (QS) with a global but suboptimal
method (generalized Bayes' theorem), we get results as
good as the ones given by a globally optimal method
(Simplex based method of Section 3.), but with a much
smaller computation time, in our example.
8 CONJUNCTION

AND D ISJUNCTION

The results involving conjunction and disjunction solved
in previous papers are not general enough to be very
useful in practice. Their merits are but tutorial. Especially,
their extension to disjunctions and conjunctions of more
than two terms look untractable in an analytic form. Even
the case when only three symbols A, B and C are
involved, and where bounds on the six conditional
probability values involving these symbols are known,
will lead to unwieldy expressions because the six values
are related via the generalized Bayes' theorem.
A more realistic approach to the problem of handling
disjunctions and conjunctions is to introduce new nodes in
the network, that account for the concerned con junctions
and disjunctions, and apply the iterative algorithm (or
linear programming) to answer the query. As an example,
let us consider the query "what is the probability of C
given A and B", where the background network includes
nodes A, B, C only; (see Figure 3)

network (the improved bounds are underlined)·

To deal with this problem we create a node named An B.
A description of the conjunction in terms of conditional
probabilities leads to force P • (A I A n B) = 1,
P.(B I A n B)= 1, P(A n B I B) = P(A I B) and
P(A n B I A)= P(B I A), and to add these arcs to the
network (see Figure 3). Then the calculation of
P(C I An B) can be addressed by the repeated use of the
Quantified Syllogism pattern and the generalized Bayes
rule in this network .

32

Amarger, Dubois, and lhde

In order to catch a feeling of what kinds of results can be
produced by this method, let us deal with the case when
the six values P(A I C), P(C I A), P(B I C), P(C I B),
P(A I B), P(B I A) are precisely known in Figure 3. Of
course they obey the generalized Bayes theorem, so that
only five of them need to be known. The calculation of
bounds for P(C I A n B) can be performed by applying
twice the syllogism rule, cancelling A between An B
and C, and cancelling B between An B and C. Applying
( 1 ) and (3) with the following substitution : A becomes
An B, B becomes A, we get

1 - P(C I A)
m aj 0, 1 � P(C IAn B)�m' j 1, P(CI A)
u\ P(B I A)
P(B I A)
\

)

sound but not optimal. Indeed we do not recover the
obvious bound,again related to additivity :
P(An B I C)� max(O, P(A I C) + P(B I C)- 1 ) (10)
More specifically, given only P(A I C)= 1 and P(B I C)=
1, the repeated use of the syllogism rule and the
generalized Bayes' rule are not capable of producing
P(A n B I C) = 1 (a result produced by the above
bound). Indeed, if we add the node AB to represent A n B,
we have to saturate the following network

)

Similarly, exchanging A and B in the above inequalities,
we get:

m ax o, 1-1-P(CIB) � P(CIAnB)�min 1, P(CIB)
P(AIB)
P(AIB)

Joining these results together, we obtain

It can be checked that this is exactly what has been
obtained in (Dubois et a!., 1 990), i.e. when we have no
knowledge about P(B I C) and P(A I C). To improve these
bounds requires the use of the generalized Bayes theorem.
As shown in (Dubois et a!., 1990) only the lower bound
of P(C I A n B) can be improved knowing P(B I C) and
P(A I C). However the following extra inequalities are not
related to the generalized Bayes theorem nor to the
quantified syllogisms

These inequalities are simple consequences of the
additivity of probabilities applied to A n B n C under
the form

All that this network tells is that AB <;;; A n B and C <;;;
An B, but clearly, ABn C can be anything. Also, even
assuming that P(A I B) o' 1 and P(B I A) o' 1 are known
and Jetting P(AB I A) = P(B I A), P(AB I B) = P(A I B)

cannot improve the lower bound of P(AB I C) using the
syllogism rule, nor the generalized Bayes rule. This point
indicates that some of the lower bounds already obtained in
(Dubois et a!., 1 990), for the conjunction will be useful to
implement, in order to improve the performance of the
iterative procedure, i.e. the inequalities (8), (9) and (1 0).

Another poin to notice is that the constraint P(AB I A) =
P(B I A) is tronger than letting P*(AB I A) = P*(B I A),
P.(AB I A = P.(B I A), when only bounds on P(B I A)

are know , indeed, the equality of the bounds can go along
with t
inequality P(AB I A) * P(B I A). Let us consider
the
ery about P(C I A u B). To deal with this case, we
cr te a node named A u B, and arcs joining this node to
the network, so as to describe the disjunction in terms of
conditional probabilities namely P(A u B I A) = 1 and
P(A u B I B) = 1 . The calculation of P(A I A u B) and
P(B IAu B) is slightly Jess straightforward, namely

P( A I AuB)=

(Bn C))

Hence additivity is not presupposed by the description of
node A n B in Figure 3. Proceeding similarly for
P(An B I C), the syllogism rule leads to the following
bounds

(

))
)

Note that in the above expression, the two last terms in
the 'min' are equal due to the generalized Bayes' theorem.
Using results in (Dubois et al., 1 990), it can be checked
that the upper bound is optimal while the lower bound is

P(A)

P(A)

P(A uB)

P(A) + P(B) - P(A II B)

P(A I B)
=----------�--�--------P(A I B)+ P(B I A)- P(A I B)·P(B I A)
since

P(B) /P(A) =P(B I A) /P(AIB) ·

The complete study

of this case is left to the reader. A lack of optimality
similar to the one encountered with conjunction will be
observed.

9 INDEPENDENCE

ASSUMPTIONS

Although our approach does not require independence
assumptions, it should be possible to use them if they
hold, in order to improve bounds. This section gives
preliminary results on that point, for the syllogism rule

Constraint Propagation with Imprecise Conditional Probabilities

QS. Let us consider conditional independence relations.
There are three possible ones on (A, B, C):
i)
ii)
iii)

P(Bn C I A) =P(B I A) P(C I A)
P(An C I B) =P(A I B) · P(C I B)
P(An B I C)= P(A I C) P(B I C)
·

·

First, note that i) and iii) are symmetric with respect to
each other, exchanging C and A. We shall thus just
consider i) and ii). ii) has already been considered in the
introduction and we shall check that we cannot do better:
ii) is indeed equivalent to the irrelevance property
P(C I B)= P(C I A n B). Hence the independence
property can be exploited by substituting P(C I B) =
P(C I A n B) in the bounds on P(C I An B) (equations
(6), (7)). Only the bounds where P(C I A) appear are
useful. We get (for precise values)
1 - (1- P(C I A) /P(B 1 A))�P(C I B)� P(C I A) /p(B 1 A)
from which it follows :
P(C IB)· P(BIA)� P(C lA)� 1-P(B lA) + P(CIB)· P(B lA) (11)

the lower bound improves (3) and the upper bound
improves the second term in the general upper bound (4).
Particularly, when P(B I A) = 1 it can be checked that ii)
entails P(C I A)= P(C I B). For bounds on P(A I C), just
exchange A and C in the above inequalities, and get
P(AIB) P(BIC)� P(AIC)� 1-P(BIC)+ P(AIB) P(BIC) (12)

The above inequalities can influence P(C I A) using the
generalized Bayes rule since
P(AIC)= P(CIA) P(AIB)-P(BIC) t1>(BIA}P(CIB)
can be substituted in ( 12) and enable to catch the
inequality
·

B)
P(CI A)< P(B I A) P(C I (1- P(B I C) +P(A I B) P(B I C)) (13)
P(A I B) P(B I C)

that comes on top of ( 1 1) (the lower bound of ( 1 1) is
obtained again this way). It improves the last term
appearing in the upper bound in (4).
Let us tum to i). It yields a new expression for P(C I A)
under the from P(B n C I A)I?(B I A). Let us write it by
letting P(A I B n C) appear;using the generalized Bayes
rule:
I
P(C I A) = P(A I B n C) · P(C B)
P(A I B)
Now using optimal bounds (6) and (7) on P(A I Bn C),
and given that P(A I C) is unknown there comes
max

(

o. I-

1- P(C I

B ))� P(C I A)� min(1. P(C I B)) 1 )
( 4
P(AIB)
P(AIB)

Again, if P(C I B)= I, we conclude that P(C I A)= 1.
Moreover if P(A I B)= 1, then P(C I A)=P(C I B). The
lower bound in (14) improves (3), and the upper bound
may improve the third term in (4).
Independence assumption iii) leads to a similar bracketting
of P(A I C), just exchanging C and A in (14) :
max

- P(A I B))� P(AI C)� min(!. P(A I B) )(15)
( 1- IP(C
I B)
P(C I B)
o.

(15) and the generalized Bayes rule enable special bounds
for P(C I A) to be found under assumption iii), namely :

P(B I A)
P(B I C)

[I

_

1 - P(C I B )
]�

P(AI B)

P(CI A)�

P(B IA) !6
( )
P(BI C)

Again the lower bound in (16) improves (3), and the upper
bound may improve the third term in (4).
To summarize, when independence assumptions are
declared, namely i), ii), iii), bounds on P(C I A) given in
(3) and (4) can be improved by means of ( 14), ( 1 1) and
( 13), and (16) respectively. Of course, these types of
independence assumption can be more directly exploited in
queries involving conjunctions or disjunctions.
10 CONCLUSION

The approach proposed in this paper to handle conditional
probabilities in knowledge networks presupposes
assumptions that contrast with the ones underlying
Bayesian networks. In Bayesian networks, a single joint
probability distribution is reconstructed from the acyclic
network using conditional independence assumptions, and
given some a priori probabilities on the roots of the
acyclic network. Here, nothing is assumed about a priori
(unconditional) probabilities, no independence assumption
is taken for granted, and, the more cycles there are, the
more informative the network is.
Results obtained so far indicate that the two inference rules
that we use in tum, namely the syllogism rule (QS) and
the generalized Bayes' theorem (BG), are powerful and can
compete with a brute force linear programming approach,
as regards the quality of the obtained probability bounds.
Our inference technique seems to be more efficient than
linear programming since each run of each step of the
inference procedure is polynomial in the number of nodes
in the network. However, more investigation is needed on
complexity aspects, and to better grasp the distance to
optimality of the inference procedure.
It has been indicated how to deal with conditional
probabilities involving conjunctions and disjunctions of
two terms, and negation of terms. However the obtained
optimal bounds are rather heavy mathematical expressions
for conjunctions and disjunctions, and it seems difficult to
extrapolate them to more than two terms. It has been
shown how to solve the problem of conjunction and
disjunction by introducing auxiliary nodes in the original
network. In the future, we plan to treat negation likewise
and to generalize the node addition approach to the
combination of more than two primitive terms.
In the long run, we plan to develop a computerized tool
(parts of which are already implemented) that can handle a
knowledge base in the form of a pair (W,/'!.) where W is a
set of facts and !'!. a sets of conditional probabilities. A
query Q can then be solved by computing P(Q I W) where
W is the conjunction of available facts, and P(Q I W) is
obtained under the form of bounds derived from the

saturated network built with �. This mode of reasoning is
similar to what happens in non-monotonic logic. More
specifically some of the propagation rules proposed here
bear some interesting analogies with some derived
inference rules in a well-behaved non-monotonic logic.
For instance the BG rule corresponds to
a1 fv az, az

fv U3, ... , Un·l fv Un, Un fv Ut (loop)
Ut fv Un

where "" denotes the non-monotonic consequence relation
discussed in (Kraus and al, 1990). The QS rule gives
a1 tv az, az tv at, az tv

Ut fv U3

the basic lower bound for P(A
al., 1990)) corresponds to
'6 tv a, '6 tv

'(fvU/\�

U3 (equivalence)

n

B IC) (see (Amarger et

P (right and)

These analogies are no longer surprizing since such kinds
of links between probabilistic reasoning and non­
monotonic logic have been already laid bare by (Pearl,
1988) and the authors (Dubois and Prade, 1991). But the
correspondence pointed out above suggests to consider a
nonmonotonic logic where primitive inference rules are
the above rules, i.e.ru1es which are usually considered as
derived ones. This point is worth studying in the future.
Among topics of interest for future research, a more
detailed comparison with the Bayesian approach would be
quite interesting, of course. It would allow the loss of
information due to the absence of a priori probabilities to
be quantified. It has been demonstrated how to allow for
independence assumptions in our approach. Clearly it
generates non-linear constraints in the optimization
problem associated to a query. But it seems that the
inference procedure can cope with these assumptions in a
nicer way, just by modifying the constraint propagation
rules accordingly. Another topic is the extension of our
method to fuzzy quantifiers, already considered in (Dubois
and Prade, 1988) for the syllogism rule.
