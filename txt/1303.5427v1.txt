Abstract

Many AI synthesis problems such as planning
or scheduling may be modelized as constraint
satisfaction problems (CSP). A CSP is typically
defined as the problem of finding any consis­
tent labeling for a fixed set of variables satisfy­
ing all given constraints between these variables.
However, for many real tasks such as job-shop
scheduling, time-table scheduling, design ... , all
these constraints have not the same significance
and have not to be necessarily satisfied. A first
distinction can be made between hard constraints,
which every solution should satisfy and soft con­
straints, whose satisfaction has not to be certain.
In this paper, we formalize the notion of possi­
bilistic constraint satisfaction problems that al­
lows the modeling of uncertainly satisfied con­
straints. We use a possibility distribution over
labelings to represent respective possibilities of
each labeling. Necessity-valued constraints al­
low a simple expression of the respective cer­
tainty degrees of each constraint.
The main advantage of our approach is its integra­
tion in the CSP technical framework. Most clas­
sical techniques, such as Backtracking (BT}, arc­
consistency enforcing (AC) or Forward Checking
have been extended to handle possibilistics CSP
and are effectively implemented. The utility of
our approach is demonstrated on a simple design
problem.

Introduction

There are a lot of publications about constraints, and more
specifically in the CSP framework, but most of these papers
try to tackle the higly combinatorial nature (NP-Hard) of
such problems only considerin g hard constraints.
,

This paper gives a clear meaning to what could be a soft
constraint, how it may be expressed and how soft constraint
satisfaction problems may be solved. Our aim is not to

give a "general" theoretical framework for expressing soft
constraints (such approaches may be found in [Satoh90]
using first and second order logic to express preferences or
in [Freuder89], relying on a problem space and a general
measure on this space}, but to give a specific (and hopefully
useful) meaning to such constraints leading to "efficient"
solving techniques.
Non standard logics are manyfold that allows the expression
of probabilities [Nilsson85], orpreferences [Shoham87]. In
particular, zadeh 's possibility theory [zadeh78] has already
been successfully used for modeling uncertainty and pref­
erences in the frame of propositional and first-order logic
by Dubois, Prade and Lang leading to the so-called "pos­
sibilistic logic" [Lang91b]. One of the desirable feature
of possibilistic semantics is the tolerance to "partial" con­
sistency, which allows a sort of paraconsistent reasoning.
Another interesting feature of possibilistic logic is the close
relationships between necessity measures and Gardenfors
"epistemic entrechment" relation [Gardenfors et al.88].
The main idea is to encapsulate preferences (or respective
certainty degree) among labelings in a "possibility distribu­
tion" over labelings. Such a distribution naturally induces
two (possibility and necessity) measures over constraints.
However, it is not clear how to simply express such a dis­
tribution.
A possible answer is to express bounds on necessity (or
possibility) measures of constraints, defining a set of possi­
bility distribution among labelings. One can then define a
set of "most possible" Iabelings satisfying these bounds.
The structure of the paper is as follows : the section 2.1 re­
calls how a Constraint Satisfaction Problem may be defined
and which objects are involved ; the section 2.2 presents
how a possibility distribution implicitly defines measures
on constraints ; the section 2.3 show s how bounds on ne­
cessity measures over constraints define "best" labelings.
The next section rapidly presents algorithmic issues for pos­
sibilistic CSP solving and shows how specific satisfaction
(Backtrack) and consistency enforcing (Arc-consistency
[Mackworth77]) techniques may be built, taking into ac­
count the induced possibility distribution.
In section 3, we give an example of application of possibilis-

and solving issues are addressed. Section 4 compares our
results with related works and is followed by a presentation

An informal meaning

Let us breafty recall the definition of a classical Constraint
Satisfaction Problem as definitions may change among au­
thors.

The usual problem is then to find a labeling of the domain­
variables in V that satisfies the conjunction of every con­
straint in C. Cryptograms (such as SEND+MORE=MONEY,

LYNDON*B=JOHNSON ) , then queens problem, ...are typ­

ical instances of CSP.

A typical CSP involves a set X= {xi, ... , x.,} of n vari­
ables and a set D of n associated domains. Each variable x;
takes its value in its associated domain d;. In the following,
we shall restrict ourself to finite domains.

Domains and variables are intrinsically bound together to
form what we will call a domain-variable. The domain­
variable i is defined as a pair ( x;, d;) where x; is a variable
and d; its associated domain. We will call V the set of
domain-variables defined by X and D.
The fact that some domain-variables take some specific
values in their domains will be represented by a labeling.
A labeling lw of a set W of domain-variables is simply
defined as an application on W such that :

ViEW, lw(i) Ed;
Alternatively, a labeling lw wil l be considered as its map
(the set {( x, lw(x))/x E W}).
Further, a set of constraints C is considered. Each con­
straint k;(it,... , i.,.) on the set of domain-variables v; =
{it, ... , inJ is a set of labelings of v;.

lw of W satisfies a
lw F= k;) iff v; c W

Modeling soft constraint with possibility and
necessity measures

In classical first order logic, soft constraint may be formal­
ized through interpretation ordering [Satoh90]. P ossibilis­
tic CSP, as indicated by their name, relies on a possibility
distribution over labelings.

We will say that a labeling is complete iff it is defined on
V, it will be partial otherwise.

Given two constraints k; and k1, we will note k, V ki
the constraint on V; u Vi that is satisfied when one of
k; or ki are satisfied. k, V ki is simply defined as the
set of every labeling I over V; u Vj such that I f= k; or

The possibility n .. ( k) represents what its name suggests
i.e., the possibility for the constraint k to be satisfied accord­
ing to the knowledge of reference. The necessity N.. (k)
tends towards 1 when the possibility that k being unsatisfied
tends toward 0, measuring to what extent the satisfaction of
k is entailed by the knowledge of reference (given by 1r).
Clearly, possibilisticCSP, as
ssibilistic logic, is not meant
to express fuzzy cons
n
as measures are attached to
precise constraints. The statement "It is 0.7 necessary that
the product be delivered before the 21th" may be translated
in possibilistic CSP to something like N.. ( D :5 21 ) = 0.7
where Dis the variable corresponding to the delivering day.
Possibilistic CSP is not intended to modelize a statement
such as 'The product should be delivered not too late after
the 2lth"2•

trai ts

Because of the min and max operators, the precise values
of neces sity or possibility is not so important. The essen­
tial is the total pre order induced by them. Thus, necessity
degrees express preference degrees, N.. (k) > N.. (k') ex­
pressing that the satisfaction of k is preferred to the satisfac­
tion of k'. Therefore, possibilistic CSP are closely related
to Hierarchical CSP as described in the frame of Constraint
Logic Programming in (Boming et al.89].

The notion of "constraint satisfaction will now depend on
a possibility distribution 1r on Lv. Let us consider ( k, a) a
necessity-valued constraint.
"

We will say
(k, a) is satisfied by 1r (noted 1r F (k, a )
itT the necessity measure Nf( induced by 1r on K verifies
N.-(k) ;::: a. Considering the whole constraint set C, we
will say that the CSP ( V, C) is satisfied by a possibility
measure 1r iff the necessity measure induced by 1r verifies :

2In fact, such a predicate may be decomposed in a set of

crisp predicates (a-cuts of the vague constraint). In our case,
the domains being finite, the set of a-cuts is finite and a given
fuzzy constraint may be decomposed in a finite set of possibilistic
constraints. However, this (possibly automatic) conversion may
be heavy and the result is (from an expressive view-point) quite
distant from the original knowledge.

A typical possibilistic CSP is then defined by a finite set

(defining a set V of domain-variables) and by a fi nite set

(X, D, C) or (V, C).

necessary. The necessity-valued constraint (k, 1) expresses
that k should absolutely be satisfied, and therefore takes the
usual meaning of a constraint in classical CSP ; (k, 0 ) is
totally useless as it expresses that the necessity measure of
k should be at least 0, which is always true.

The only difference between a classical and a possibilistic

Thus a possibilistic CSP has not a set of consistent labeling,

Thus, the inconsistency degree of a possibilistic CSP is
equal to the smallest necessity degree of the unsatisfiable
constraint l. for all possibility distribution satisfying C.

The computa on of the inconsistency degree of a possi­
bilistic CSP is made easier by the fact that one can define a
maximal possibility distribution among all possibility dis­
tribution satisfying (V, C).

The next step towards sophistication (and efficiency) is the
"test and generate" approach, often referred as the "Back­
track" algorithm (BT). The obvious idea is to cut each
branch that will necessarily lead to complete labelings that
do not satisfy every constraint. Each non-terminal node
corresponds to a partial labeling I. To possibly lead to a
complete labeling that satisfies every constraint, a partial
labeling should be consistent :

complete labeling. In a depth first exploration of the tree,
we will retain the set of the labelings that maximize 1Tp (l).

Then, computing the inconsistency degree of a CSP means
computing the sub-nonnalization degree of the distribu­
tion 1r;,. The set of all labeling Lv being finite, we
can define the set Lv of all Jabelings of V such that
VI* E Ly,1rp(l) = 1-SN(7r;,). Thiswill be called the set
of the best labelings of 'P. Its elements are the most com­
patible labelings with the CSP 'P = (V, C) among every
labeling. The problem of finding a "best labeling" may be
reduced to find a labeling r that solve any of the following
equivalent Min-Max optimisation problems :

<l depth first tree exploration, the property
of consistency is simply checked at each node. Backtrack
occurs when it is not verified. One should note that if a
labeling I on { 1 , ... , i} is consistent, each labelings I' on
{1, . . . , i, i + 1} is consistent iff it satisfies the constraints
k1 such that V; c {1, . .. , i, i + 1} and V; rt {1, ... , i} .

In the framework of possibilistic CSP, we extend the notion
of compatibility to partial labelings.
Definition 2.3

The compatibility ofa partiallabeling l A on

complete labeling more defined than /A :

C(V,C) =SUPIELv(Inf(k;,a;)EC({1- o:ifl F -.ki} U {I}))
II(V,C) = InfleLv(Sup(k,.a;)EC( {ad I F -,k;} U {0}))

search algorithms, namely Depth first Branch and Bound
(DFBB), a - {3, or SSS•...

Our aim will be to compute, for each node (i.e. each partial
labeling) an upper bound on the compatibility of the partial
labeling. An easily computed upper bound of this value is
given by:

Extending classical CSP algorithms
Generate and Test

The more obvious algorithm to solve classical CSP is the
"generate and test" algorithm. It traverses the domain­
variables in a predetermined order (1 , . .. , n). In the tree
explored, each node corresponds to a labeling. The root
of the tree is the empty labeling, the sons of a node l are

This bound is exact for complete labelings. Moreover,
it may be incrementally computed as the tree is traversed
downwards : if a labeling I on A has been granted an upper­
bound f3, each labeling [I on A u {( :ci , di )}, more defined
than l is granted the upper-bound {3' :

'lllis decreasing bound is used in a DFBB algorithm to
compute one (or every) best labeling. The algorithm sim­
ply stans with the empty labeling and extends it according
to the vertical ordering 0. It maintains two parameters of
importance : the number a under which a cutoff should
take place (increased each time a complete labeling with
an augmented compatibility has been found. It should be
initially set to zero to ensure optimality, a cutoff takes place
as soon as /3 � a) and the number {3 over which no im­
provement is possible (the bound on the compatibility of
the current partial labeling. It should initially be set to 1).
These two bounds offer a great deal of flexibility :
•

•

Typically, if a labeling whose possibility is lower than
a is considered as useless, the algorithm should be
called with a set to a, allowing a more efficient pruning
of the tree;
On the opposite side, if a labeling of possibility b is
considered as enough, the algorithm should be called
with f3 set to b, allowing the algorithm to stop as soon
as a {3 consistent labeling has been found.

Naturally, in the first case we may fail to find a best labeling
if its consistency degree is lower than a ; in the second case,
we have no garantee that the best labeling has been found.
Alternatively, one may stop the algorithm execution upon
any event (time exhausted,... ) and get the best labeling
found up to the occurrence of the event (getting closer to an
"anytime algorithm" [Dean et al.88]).

The algorithm that converts a CSP in an equivalent3 arc­
consistent CSP (if it exists) is usually embodied in a single
procedure Revise, apply ing to a domain-variable j and a
constraint k; (j E V;), that suppresses every label in the
domain di that does not satisfy the previous property. This
procedure is applied repetedly on the whole CSP until sta­
bilization (ACl to AC3).
In our case, such a label may stil l be possible if the constraint
k; is not 1-necessary. In general, the knowledge we may
extract is an upper bound on the compatibility of the partial
labelings that maps a single variable to a label.
If we consider a variable

equal to:

A possibilistic CSP will be said arc-consistent if for every
domain-variable j, the domain di is not empty,and for every
label v E di, the compatibility of {(j, v ) } with respect to
the possibilistic CSP ( {j}, U{j}) is strictly positive and
equal to the minimum of the

It may be shown that 6 is an upper-bound on the overall
consistency <C(V, C).
The main idea to convert a possibilistic CSP into an
equivalent5 arc-consistent possibilistic CSP is then to add
unary necessity-valued constraints (rather than suppressing
labels) reflecting this bound and to take these new unary
constraints in account when the process is repetedly ap­

Every usual vertical heuristic ordering (max. cardinality,
max. degree, ... ), may be applied to this tree search. An
horizontal heuristic is given by the current bounds obtained
for the various labels, but its efficiency is y et to be evalu­
ated (it is welllrnown that horizontal ordering has a strong
influence on the efficiency of Min-Max problems solving,
e.g. in Alpha-Beta algorithm applied to games [Pearl85]).

The additionnal information obtained is taken into account
in the tree search algorithm and may greatly enhance the
performances of the algorithm (tighter bounds on partial in­
consistencies are obtained earlier). The termination (which
is quite trivial) and complexity of the algorithm, the unicity
of the problem obtained are yet to be formaly determined.
Limited applications of the Reviser procedure during the
tree search exploration (so-called Forward Checking, or
Partial Look-Ahead) that are usual in CSP are immediately
usable in possibilistic CSP and have been implemented.

b

should be noted that a possibilistic CSP containing
only HARD constraints is strictly equivalent to a classi­
cal CSP and that extended algorithms (tree exploration,
arc-consistency) behave exactly as corresponding classical
CSP algorithms. Therefore "softness" costs (almost) noth­
ing when left unused. The only overhead is due to the
manipulation of the floating point numbers 1.0 and 0.0 and
the operators min/max instead of boolean true and false and
logical operators and/or.

0ne may also define 1-weak arc-consistency enforcing by
limiting the Revise1r to the inference of unary constraints whose

necessity is greater or equal than "Y· 1-weak arc-consistency leads
to label suppression. 0-weak arc-consistency is possibilistic arc­

consistency.

The overall consistency degree of the CSP is therefore equal
to 0.8. As the knowledge introduced makes no difference
between a soft and a dry white wine, our customer will
either drink its "foie gras" with a dry wine or its fish with a
soft wine. Nobody is perfect ...
The size of this problem makes arc-consistency enforcing
and forward-checking useless. Nevertheless, one may note
that the problem is actually 0.8 arc-consistent. As an exam­
ple, one of the unary constraint infered by arc-consistency

Further researchs

We are currentl y working on the conversion of the possi­
bilistic AC1 like algorithm to more sophisticated schemes
as AC4 [Mohr et al.86]. A matter of study is also the fix­
point semantics of the possibilisticarc-consistency as is has
been done for classical CSP [Gusgen et al.88].
Several extension of possibilistic CSPs may be considered :

enforcing is a constraint that forbids the label "white vine"
with a 0.2 necessity (as b( { (drink, white wine ) }, a) = 0.8).
We are currently trying to apply these techniques in the
frame of job-shop scheduling. It is clear that the particular
nature of the constraints that appears in this framework
could (and should) be taken into account in the propagation
process, as it may be done in the AC-5 [Deville et al.91]
algorithm in classical CSP.

Related works

The obviously related work is ..possibilistic logic"
[Lang91b] which has been a fundamental basis for pos­
sibilistic CSP definition. J. Lang [Lang91a] has applied
propositional possibilistic logic to constraint satisfaction
problems. In our opinion, our approach offers greater
expressive power (let us recall that the encoding of the
SEND+MORE=MONEY problem in propositional logic leads
to no more than 2060 clauses and 88 propositional vari­
ables) and more varied and powerful techniques (the only
resolution technique used in propositional possibilistic logic
being essentialy a "backjumping-Iike" algorithm [Oxusoff
et al.89,Gashnig79]).
Other related works include Hierarchical Constraint Logic
Programming [Boming et al.89] that allows the expression
of prioritized constraints in the body of an Hom clause.
Satoh [Satoh90] proposes a formalisation of soft constraints
based on an interpretations ordering but does not provide
any algorithmic issue.
The system GARI [Descottes et al.85] which is more ori­
ented towards production rules is very close to ours as it
compute a solution that is the best compromise under a
set of antagonist constraints. It is also close to the OPAL
scheduling system [Bel et al.89,Bel et al.88] which has

Many CSP techniques (AC-n, path or k-consistency,
backjumping, learning, tree clustering, cycle cutset)
and useful properties (Freuder theorems [Freuder82])
should be adapted or extended to possibilistic CSP ;
The integration of fuzzy constraints (defined as a fuzzy
set of authorized labelings) is almost immediate and
leads to an even greater expressive power.
As is has been shown for possibilistic logic [Dubois
et al.91b], the pre-order induced by necessity-valued
constraints is a numerical "epistemic entrenchment"
relation [Gardenfors et al.88]. The consistency degree
of a possibilistic CSP may be considered as an indica­
tor of the constraints that should be suppressed for the
"contraction" of a CSP upon revision. However, as an
anonymous referee pointed out, that means excluding
every constraint below the inconsistency degree. This
is somewhat too drastic, for some of these constraints
may be not "involved" in inconsistencies. This could
be corrected by an adequate redefinition of the label­
ing compatibility, or by complete redefinition of the
mesure used. However, algorithmic issues will have
to be reconsidered.
Possibility and necessity measures may be seen as spe­
cific decomposable measures [Dubois et a1.82]. We
think that most of this work could be easily extended
to such measures (including probabilistic measures).
Algorithmic issues will again have to be reconsidered.
Possibilistic logic programming as been experimented
in [Dubois et al.91a]. The integration of Possibilistic
logic programming and possibilistic CSP is a first step
toward Possibilistic Constraint Logic Programming.
