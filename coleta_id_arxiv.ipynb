In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a\\nqualitative rather than quantitative way. In this paper, we propose a\\nqualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional\\ndependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus\\n(all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact\\nand arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics\\nfor this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited\\nin several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates\\n(is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference\\nrelation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.\\n\\n\\nC.

Previously, the complexity of dominance has been\\ndetermined for restricted classes in which the dependency graph of the CP-net\\nis acyclic. However, there are preferences of interest that define cyclic\\ndependency graphs; these are modeled with general CP-nets. In our main results,\\nwe show here that both dominance and consistency for general CP-nets are\\nPSPACE-complete. We then consider the concept of strong dominance, dominance\\nequivalence and dominance incomparability, and several notions of optimality,\\nand identify the complexity of the corresponding decision problems. The\\nreductions used in the proofs are from STRIPS planning, and thus reinforce the\\nearlier established connections between both areas.\\n\\n\\nJudy Goldsmith\\n\\n\\nJerome Lang\\n\\n\\nMiroslaw Truszczyski\\n\\n\\nNic Wilson\\n\\n10.1613/jair.2627\\n\\nJournal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 33, pages\\n  403-432, 2008\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5107v2\\n2010-01-20T12:12:28Z\\n2009-10-27T12:40:17Z\\nThe Complexity of Iterated Strategy Elimination\\n  We consider the computational complexity of the question whether a certain\\nstrategy can be removed from a game by means of iterated elimination of\\ndominated strategies.

In one dimension, we investigate intersection graphs\\ninduced by translates of a fixed pattern Q that consists of a finite number of\\nintervals and a finite number of isolated points. We prove that Dominating Set\\non such intersection graphs is polynomially solvable whenever Q contains at\\nleast one interval, and whenever Q contains no intervals and for any two point\\npairs in Q the distance ratio is rational. The remaining case where Q contains\\nno intervals but does contain an irrational distance ratio is shown to be\\nNP-complete and contained in FPT (when parameterized by the solution size). In\\ntwo and higher dimensions, we prove that Dominating Set is contained in W[1]\\nfor intersection graphs of semi-algebraic sets with constant description\\ncomplexity. This generalizes known results from the literature.

The properties of coronal solutions\\ndepend significantly on the description of advection. Local parameterization of\\nadvection by a constant coeficient $\\\\delta$ replacing the radial derivatives\\nlead to complex topology of solutions, similar to some extent to other\\nadvection-dominated accretion flow solutions. One, radiatively cooled branch\\nexists for low accertion rates. For higher accretion rates two solutions exist\\nin a broad range of radii: one is radiatively cooled and the other one is\\nadvection-dominated. With further increase of accretion rate the radial\\nextensions of the two solutions shrink and no solutions are found above certain\\ncritical value. However, these trends change if the local parameterization of\\nadvection is replaced by proper radial derivatives computed iteratively from\\nthe model. Only one, radiatively cooled solution remains, and it exists even\\nfor high accretion rates. The advection-dominated branch disappears during the\\niteration process which means that a self-consistently described\\nadvection-dominated flow cannot exist in the presence of an underlying cold\\ndisc.\\n\\n\\nAgnieszka Janiuk\\n\\n\\nPiotr T.

The class of well-dominated graphs forms a subclass of the\\nwell studied class of well-covered graphs. While the recognition problem for\\nthe class of well-covered graphs is known to be co-NP-complete, the recognition\\ncomplexity of well-dominated graphs is open.\\n  In this paper we introduce the notion of an irreducible dominating set, a\\nvariant of dominating set generalizing both minimal dominating sets and minimal\\ntotal dominating sets. Based on this notion, we characterize the family of\\nminimal dominating sets in a lexicographic product of two graphs and derive a\\ncharacterization of the well-dominated lexicographic product graphs. As a side\\nresult motivated by this study, we give a polynomially testable\\ncharacterization of well-dominated graphs with domination number two, and show,\\nmore generally, that well-dominated graphs can be recognized in polynomial time\\nin any class of graphs with bounded domination number. Our results include a\\ncharacterization of dominating sets in lexicographic product graphs, which\\ngeneralizes the expression for the domination number of such graphs following\\nfrom works of Zhang et al. (2011) and of \\\\v{S}umenjak et al.

For computing l,\\nwe need to project the solutions into one dimension along O(n) distinct\\ndirections but no further algebraic manipulations. The solutions are then\\ndirectly reconstructed from the considered projections. The first step is\\ndeterministic, whereas the second step uses randomization, thus being\\nLas-Vegas.\\n  The theoretical analysis of our approach shows that the overall cost for the\\ntwo problems considered above is dominated by the cost of carrying out the\\nprojections. We also give bounds on the bit complexity of our algorithms that\\nare exclusively stated in terms of the number of variables, the total degree\\nand the bitsize of the input polynomials.\\n\\n\\nCornelius Brand\\n\\n\\nMichael Sagraloff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508186v1\\n2005-08-10T16:10:59Z\\n2005-08-10T16:10:59Z\\nStructure of the tensor product semigroup\\n  We study structure of the semigroup Tens(G) consisting of triples of dominant\\nweights (\\\\lambda,\\\\mu,\\\\nu) of a complex reductive Lie group G such that the\\ntriple tensor product of the corresponding irreducible representations of G has\\na nonzero G-invariant vector.

It consists of assembling a node set of global minimum size\\nsuch that any node of the network is either in this set or is adjacent to at\\nleast one node of this set. Although this is a difficult optimization problem\\nin general, we show it can be exactly solved by a generalized leaf-removal\\nprocess if the network contains no core. If the network has an extensive core,\\nwe estimate the size of minimum dominating sets by a mean-field theory and\\nimplement a belief-propagation algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions. Our\\nalgorithms also perform well on real-world network instances.\\n\\n\\nJin-Hua Zhao\\n\\n\\nYusupjan Habibulla\\n\\n\\nHai-Jun Zhou\\n\\n10.1007/s10955-015-1220-2\\n\\nExtensively revised (final version to be published in Journal of\\n  Statistical Physics). 19 pages in total\\nJournal of Statistical Physics 159: 1154--1174 (2015)\\n  </p>\\n </body>\\n</html>\""
